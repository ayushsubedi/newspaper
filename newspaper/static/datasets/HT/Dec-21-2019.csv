FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

2,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

3,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

4,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

The ordinance will now be sent to the President for certification.
The Authority, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister, is being set up prior to the international donors’ conference, scheduled for June 25, which aims at seeking support from the international communities to rebuild Nepal.
When the ordinance is certified, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala will nominate four ministers and three experts as members of the high-level body, according to Minister for General Administration Lalbabu Pandit.
Likewise, Vice-Chairperson of the National Planning Commission and Chief Secretary will be members of the Authority.
The post-earthquake Reconstruction Authority will have a chief executive officer also. It will oversee all reconstruction works in the earthquake-hit districts where physical infrastructures have been damaged.
Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam informed that there will be a separate committee of foreign consultants that would be constantly supporting the Authority in its job.
According to the government’s assessment, the tremors caused damage worth Rs 513.38 billion to physical infrastructure and assets, and inflicted income loss of another Rs 187.08 billion.
The government has set the target to collect more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors for the post-earthquake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
 Objectives of International Conference on Nepal’s Reconstruction

KATHMANDU: The government has set the target to garner more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors’ conference being organised on June 25 for the post-quake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
A study of losses caused by the devastating Gorkha Quake on April 25 and its aftershocks in various regions across the country shows that physical infrastructures worth Rs 512 billion were damaged by the quake and over Rs 666 billion was needed for reconstruction, rehabilitation and new construction.
The government is preparing to collect the assistance by presenting the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) report in the conference prepared by the National Planning Commission for the same.
According to the PDNA report, over Rs 399 billion is necessary for reconstruction and rehabilitation tasks in cultural heritage, education, health and human settlement sectors.
Similarly, Rs 117 billion is needed for reconstruction of agriculture, industry, irrigation and tourism sectors.
Likewise, the PDNA report estimates that it will cost Rs 74.26 billion for reconstruction of media, community infrastructures, hydropower, transport and drinking water and sanitation sectors while Rs 75.11 billion to recover the damaged gender, social security, nutrition, employment, environment and forest areas into previous position.

“Government agencies have sought the additional funds based on the provision that allows them to seek budget for some highly important programmes or causes. However, we have been receiving applications seeking budget for numerous new projects which MoF might not be able to fund,” informed Uttar Kumar Khatri, spokesperson for MoF.
National Planning Commission (NPC) has topped the chart in seeking additional budget as the agency has sought additional Rs 4.75 billion from MoF.
Similarly, the Ministry of Defence has asked for Rs 3.57 billion in additional budget, while the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport has sought Rs 3.46 billion extra from MoF. The Ministry of Youths and Sports has sought Rs 3.16 billion such budget from MoF.
MoF officials expressed their concerns over ministries and government agencies not focusing on implementation of projects and programmes mentioned in the annual budget and just seeking additional budget.
“They have not been able to accelerate budget spending by implementing programmes and projects already incorporated in the budget. But at the same time, they are seeking extra budget, which is not good,” added Khatri.
As the government is under pressure to manage resources, the MoF has also urged different government agencies to carry out projects and programmes based on the annual budget. “Our focus should be to expedite project works and accelerate budget spending at present,” said Khatri.

The Department of Livestock Services (DoLS) has called livestock farmers for discussions to sort out the issue of chicken price.
As the Nepal Hatchery Industry Association has decided to destroy six million chicks in 10 days as a protest against the government, DoLS has called the association for a discussion.
Starting from December 14, the farmers have started destroying their chicks and halting the production of chicken demanding the government to increase the price of eggs and chicks.
“The department has sent a message to the association requesting it for a discussion and they are ready for the talks,” said Banshi Sharma, director general of DoLS.
As per him, the government and the association have reached a consensus for discussion after the protest ends. “It is the farmer’s right to protest for market price. So, we have decided not to interfere during their 10-day protest while they have assured us to sit for talks.”
Sharma further said that it’s normal for the price to drop when the supply is high in the market. Nepal has become self-reliant in chicken and production has exceeded market demand.
“In such a situation, a drop in price is normal but it is also true that the price of eggs and chicks needs to be revised,” he said, adding, “After their protest ends, we will hold talks with experts and farmers to sort out the issue.”
As per Sharma, farmers will have destroyed eggs and chicks worth Rs 300 million during the protest period. And due to this, the market will face shortage of around 12 million kg of chicken over the next one month as one egg takes around 21 days to hatch. Currently, the farmers are producing around four million to 4.5 million kg of chicken per month, while the market demand stands at 3.2 million kg of chicken per month.
“The government is aware about the issues of farmers and we are also trying to manage excessive production and market demand,” Sharma said, adding, “We may adopt a quota system for chicken production to determine suitable market price for both consumers and farmers.”
Under the quota system, the government will coordinate with farmers and traders for production and supply of chicken based on the market demand every month, he added.
Sharma further assured that there will be no price hike or shortage of chicken due to this protest. However, if any trader is found selling chicken and egg at a high price citing this protest, the government will take action against them.

Secretary of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MoCIT) Deepak Subedi has said that the information, communication and technology (ICT) sector of the country is still lagging behind due to lack of coordination between the government and private sector.
As the country has stepped into the digital era, Secretary Subedi stressed on cooperation with the private sector to develop ICT sector of the country. “There are a lot of innovative ideas in the country, but the problem lies in lack of coordination to harness them,” he said. “The private sector must approach us with their issues if there are any, and come up with suggestions to make this sector better in the future.”
Addressing the ICT Start-up and Innovation Mela 2019, Subedi further mentioned that the government has always appreciated ICT promotional programmes like the ICT Mela. “Today the world has entered into the information technology world without which no country can imagine their development,” he said. “Realising this fact the government has introduced the concept of ‘Digital Nepal’ and this project cannot succeed without the private sector’s support.”
He said that ICT development in Nepal is in the doldrums at the moment. “The government is a policymaker. Sometimes, even the government may not have the knowledge about related issues where we need the help of private sector,” he added. Subedi further called on the private sector to come up with their issues and ideas for discussions and to find viable solutions.
ICT Start-up and Innovation Mela which kicked off today will continue till Saturday. Around 54 start-up companies have participated in the event, said Rajan Lamsal, coordinator of the event. This year the major attraction of the event is a model of the country’s first own satellite NepaliSat-1, also known as Bird NPL. Likewise, football competition among robots is another attraction of the event, he added.
Various software developers, drone and rocket developers are participating in the event. Seminars and workshops on artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) and cloud technology, start-ups and entrepreneurship are also being conducted during the event. The organisers expect around 10,000 visitors during the course of the event.

An international court on Thursday had asked govenment to suspend CGT collection from Ncell

Kathmandu, December 20
The Large Taxpayers’ Office has started consultation with the Ministry of Finance to chart out a future course on collection of due capital gains tax on the Ncell buyout deal, as the interim order issued by an international court has raised questions over whether the government can impose tax on the sale of the telecom company.
The LTO was planning to serve a final notice on settlement of the due tax amount to Ncell soon, as the telecom company did not report to it despite the tax office’s call to deposit the outstanding CGT amount.
“We have put our plans to issue the final notice on hold for now, as an international dispute settlement court is learnt to have issued an interim order directing a complete halt in the process of collecting the capital gains tax on Ncell buyout deal,” said Jhalak Ram Adhikari, chief tax administrator at LTO. “We are currently holding discussions with the Finance Ministry and other related government bodies to determine the future course in the Ncell CGT case.”
The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes — the investment dispute settlement body of the World Bank — had issued an interim order on Thursday directing the government not to take any further steps in enforcing its decision to collect Rs 22.4 billion in outstanding capital gains tax, including interest and penalties, from Ncell out of the company’s share divestment from TeliaSonera Norway to Axiata UK in April 2016.
The interim order was issued on the basis of arbitration proceedings initiated by Axiata Investments (UK) and Ncell against the Nepal government.
Though the LTO is yet to receive any official letter regarding the ICSID’s interim order to this effect, it said that tax collection process will be initiated based on the recent verdict of the Supreme Court and existing legal provisions.
“However, we will first hold consultations with government bodies, including the Finance Ministry, Inland Revenue Department and Office of the Attorney General, on this recent twist,” added Adhikari.
Axiata Investments (UK) and Ncell had moved the international dispute settlement court in April against LTO after it determined CGT liability on Ncell worth Rs 62.63 billion on the company’s buyout deal. Though Ncell has already paid a part of the outstanding CGT, Axiata and Ncell have been saying that ‘the act of imposing CGT’ in connection with the Ncell buyout deal ‘contravenes Nepal’s international law obligations under the 1993 Nepal-UK Bilateral Investment Treaty’.
Meanwhile, officials of the Ministry of Finance and IRD were reluctant to comment on the future course of the government in CGT collection from Ncell.

The Bangladeshi government has finalised the power purchase agreement with GMR, developer of the 900-megawatt Upper Karnali Hydro Electric Project, paving the way for the financial closure of the project.
On December 18, the Cabinet Committee on Public Purchase approved the power purchase agreement rate to purchase 500 megawatts of energy generated by the project.
As per the decision of CCPP, Bangladesh will import the electricity through Indian firm GMR at a tariff rate of 7.72 cents (equivalent to Rs 8.80) per unit for a period of 25 years.
KK Sharma, project head of UKHEP, said the Bangladeshi government will soon sign the letter of intent with GMR and finalise other necessary legal issues to materialise the agreement. He added that GMR is accelerating the pace to complete the necessary work for energy trade and working towards the project’s financial closure by 2020.
“We have finalised the PPA with the Bangladeshi government and the process of LoI and financial closure will soon start,” said Sharma.

On November 21, Bangladeshi State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid, speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the seventh Power Summit in Kathmandu, had hinted that they would get the PPA rate endorsed from their Cabinet at the earliest.
According to Sharma, UKHEP will be the first private Nepal-based company to export hydropower to Bangladesh via India as per a trilateral agreement. “It will also open the door for Nepal’s energy export to India and other neighbouring countries.”
The project cost of UKHEP is estimated to hover around $1.1 billion. As per GMR, the company plans to collect 15 per cent of investment through Nepali banks and financial institutions and the initial agreement has been made with them. Nabil Bank and Nepal Investment Bank have shown interest to lead the debt consortium for the 15 per cent financing.
“We are also in negotiations with Indian Exim Bank, Chinese Exim Bank, Asian Development Bank, World Bank and Netherlands Development Finance Company and other multilateral lenders for the remaining project financing,” Sharma added.
According to GMR, the project will be built as per engineering, procurement and construction model and the contract will be awarded to the selected firms by March if everything goes as planned.
GMR has selected three companies for civil, hydromechanical and other infrastructure works and seven companies for electromechanical works through open bidding.
The Bangladeshi government has already inked an agreement with GMR and the Nepal government to purchase 500 megawatts of power from the project.
GMR added that it had signed an MoU with NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd of India for sale of surplus electricity generated by the project. It is also trying to sign an off-take agreement with Bangladesh Power Development Board.
Nepal will get 108 megawatts (12 per cent) of power and 27 per cent equity from the Upper Karnali project free of cost. The reservoir project has been modelled to run in full capacity for only three months in a year. It is being constructed under the build-own-operate-transfer model. As per the project development pact, the project will be handed over to the government after 30 years.
However, the land acquisition process is yet to be finalised as the landownership certificates were destroyed in an arson attack during the Maoist insurgency. “We have to first sort out the land ownership issue before we can start providing compensation to the rightful owners,” said Sharma.

Amid rising scepticism among firms about the social security scheme of the government, which has led to low participation in the programme, the government today issued a six-point clarification on different issues related to the scheme.
The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MoLESS) has primarily clarified that employers and employees will not lose any social security facilities that they have been getting through other government agencies by switching to the social security fund (SSF).
Among others, banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have been expressing their reservations against registering at SSF citing that the government’s social security scheme does not even ensure benefits to employers and employees being provided by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Citizen Investment Trust (CIT), where they are currently registered.
“Participating in the social security scheme does not affect any facilities that workers and employees are already getting from other government agencies,” the ministry said.

Meanwhile, the ministry has stated that facilities and outcomes of the social security scheme cannot be compared with facilities provided by other similar funds and schemes. “Every fund and programme has different objectives. The contribution-based social security scheme is purely intended to ensure security of workers,” added the ministry.
Unlike other funds, the SSF intends to promote capital formation in the country as well as develop habit among people to save money, reads the ministry’s clarification.
Likewise, the ministry has also clarified that contributors to SSF can get certain amount of loan from SSF. “A guideline on issuing loans from the SSF is being drafted,” as per MoLESS.
So far, 131,577 workers and 11,797 employers have been listed in the social security scheme. Though the government had repeatedly appealed for institutions to join the scheme, participation in the programme has not been very encouraging.
The government had set deadline for private firms to join the SSF by November 30.
However, a majority of firms are yet to join SSF.
Primarily, the bankers have been demanding that the government include insurance policy for dependent family members of the banking staffers. Likewise, they are also seeking flexibility in the sense that they want the mandatory registration of staffers in the SSF be applicable only for those who join the institution after the fund was established.
Under the contribution-based social security scheme, private sector employees have to contribute 11 per cent of their basic salary to the fund, while employers or firms have to chip in another 20 per cent of employees’ basic salary to the fund.

Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada has stressed on the need to amend a few policies to ensure financial discipline.
Addressing the concerns raised by lawmakers on government’s failure to expedite development budget spending at the Parliamentary Finance Committee meeting here today, Khatiwada said, “It is necessary to remove some provisions in existing policies that are affecting smooth implementation of the budget.”
Citing that low spending in big projects and their tepid progress will affect financial discipline, Khatiwada emphasised on the need for binding prerequisites to ensure timely project completion and effective spending.
Like in previous years, the government has failed to enhance its budget implementation capacity, with capital expenditure at just 9.05 per cent in first five months of ongoing fiscal.
During the meeting today, Khatiwada also said that contractors and developers play a crucial role in the entire ecosystem of budget.
Similarly, he also said that both local and provincial governments should be highly responsible towards project development, its execution, spending and maintaining budgetary and fiscal discipline.
Speaking at the meeting, Ram Kumar Phuyal, member at the National Planning Commission (NPC), informed that development budget expenditure in these four months is almost five per cent less compared to the first four months of last fiscal year. “Government’s inability to improve spending will directly affect developmental goals and economic growth target,” he said, adding that the government should identify major obstacles behind budget spending and address them gradually.
He also criticised the government’s trend of spending a majority of budget towards the end of the fiscal.
Meanwhile, Finance Secretary Rajan Khanal said that development budget spending was low as multi-year projects were not progressing properly.

The Department of Revenue Investigation (DRI) has filed a case against Varun Beverages (Nepal) Pvt Ltd — a multinational company — on allegations of issuing fake value added tax (VAT) bills.
Filing a case at Kathmandu District Court today against seven former and present directors of the company, the department has sought nearly Rs 1.95 billion in principal amount and penalties.
The DRI is seeking to recover Rs 649.60 million in principal amount, along with a fine that is double the principal amount or nearly Rs 1.30 billion, from the company.
The department has also urged the court to consider jailing the directors of the company for up to three years, as per a provision in the Revenue Leakage (Investigation and Control) Act-1995.
The defendants in the case filed by DRI today include Amit Gupta, Ravikanta Jaipuriya, Rohit Kohli, Prabin Kumar Agrawal, Vinod Kumar Singh and Ashok Kumar and the company itself.
The case filed at the district court today was a culmination of a four-month-long investigation on Varun Beverages (Nepal), according to Dirgha Raj Mainali, director general of DRI.
According to him, the department had initiated the probe based on a tip-off that the company was engaged in VAT bill scam that amounted to millions.

While the department had until now seemingly only targeted small companies, Mainali said, “Now, we are expanding our probe into large sized firms too, including other multinational companies.”
The case has come to light at a time when the government has been struggling to meet its VAT and income tax collection targets. The VAT and income tax shortfall in the first four months of fiscal 2019-20 stood at around Rs 21 billion.
In the period between mid-July and mid-November, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) collected revenue amounting to Rs 104 billion, which was 83.2 per cent of the set target. Of the IRD’s annual revenue collection target of Rs 506 billion set for the current fiscal, the target for the first four months was Rs 125 billion.
As per section 4 (A) and (B) of Revenue Leakage (Investigation and Control) Act-1995, the DRI has already seized the bank guarantee of Rs 1.60 billion of Varun Beverages before the case was filed at the Kathmandu District Court, informed Mainali.
During the investigation, the DRI discovered that the company had been issuing fake VAT bills while conducting business with its business partners between fiscal years 2013-14 and 2018-19. The department has said that the company was able to evade VAT amount worth Rs 253.40 million and Rs 396.15 million in income tax and dividend during the five years.
As per Mainali, the Rs 1.95 billion that the department is trying to recover is by far the largest amount in terms of VAT bill scam.
The DRI registered 28 cases against 76 individuals related to VAT and income tax scams and sought recovery of Rs 10.29 billion in principal amount and fines in the first four months of the current fiscal.
The department has till date filed cases against 515 individuals on VAT and income tax scams and sought nearly Rs 37 billion in principal and penalties along with three-year imprisonment of the accused.

20,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/onion-crisis-raises-a-stink-for-indias-prime-minister-modi/,"NEW DELHI: With crops ruined by a combination of drought and rot, the price of onions has skyrocketed in India and added to worries over food inflation at a time when the slowing economy has become a liability for the government.
The price of onions, a staple now too expensive for most Indian families, is seen by some economists as a key indicator of economic stability and opposition parties have seized on the issue by wearing onion garlands at street rallies and offering onions instead of gold as wedding gifts.


“The common man doesn’t understand bigger economic issues. But the onion prices will make him think twice before trusting a government,” said Karthik Ganguly, a political analyst and a professor of economics at Delhi University. “The soaring onion prices can put the government in a fix.”
The onion crisis is piling pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is already dealing with large-scale protests against a new citizenship law that has raised concerns about his party’s Hindu nationalist agenda and further alienated the country’s 200 million Muslims.
Onion prices in some Indian cities have tripled to 200 rupees ($2.79) per kilogram ($1.25 per pound) over the past month after untimely rains caused crops to fail. The government has attempted to deal with the problem by selling onions at a subsidized price in some states, halting exports and cracking down on hoarders. It also plans to import onions from Turkey and Egypt, but those shipments won’t arrive until January.
Finance Minister Sitharaman answered questions in Parliament about soaring onion prices by saying she doesn’t “eat much onion and garlic.”
“I come from a family that doesn’t have much to do with onions,” Sitharaman said.
The remark was seen by many Indians as tone-deaf and a sign that the government isn’t taking the issue seriously.
“This tells us how the government thinks about the very basic problems faced by the common people. They don’t care,” said Shalini Mehta, a teacher.
The onion crisis is adding to existing economic concerns. India’s economy expanded 4.5% in the July-September quarter, its slowest rate in six quarters. Retail inflation has also been rising, touching a three year high of 5.54% in November. The slowdown follows several major shocks brought on by Modi’s government, including a massive demonetization meant to counter widespread tax evasion and corruption and the introduction of a goods and services tax.
Now onion prices are hitting family budgets and the bottom line of street vendors and small restaurants.
“An average middle-class Indian is now thinking twice before buying onions,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, who heads the New Delhi wing of Confederation of All India Traders, a body of small traders and businesses.
On a recent morning, in the southern India city of Bangalore, only a handful of vendors sold onions at a farmers market bustling with hundreds of people. Many vendors have given up on selling onions due to the prices, and those still selling them rue their meagre profits.
Shankar Burman, a construction worker who lives with 10 other people, said the rising price of onions was putting a strain on what he could buy for their joint kitchen.
Out in the countryside, farmers are also struggling.
Sudesh Patil, a farmer in Maharashtra state, had to plant three times due to excess rains, adding to his costs.
“Whatever onions my farm produced were stored in warehouses and they rotted because of flooding,” said Patil.
Mahtab Wali, a restaurant manager in New Delhi, said his chefs have cut back on the amount of onion they use in their famous Mughal dishes.
“The onion,” he said, “has now become a rare precious stone inside our kitchen.”

The government has tightened the rule for international companies wishing to deploy inflight security officer in their aircraft.
Revising the Civil Aviation Security Rules, 2016, the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) has brought new rules to ensure the security of the country’s aviation sector.
The procedures for the airline companies to receive permission for in-flight security officer has been lengthened.
According to the revised rule, any airline company wishing to deploy in-flight security officer in the aircraft must get the recommendation letter from its own country’s civil aviation authority and submit it to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN).
After that, the CAAN has to recommend it to MoCTCA and the latter has to recommend it to the Ministry of Home Affairs for permission to keep in-flight security officer in the aircraft.
The previous rule had simply mentioned that ‘in case an in-flight security officer has to be kept inside an aircraft, permission of Ministry of Home Affairs shall have to be acquired accompanied by a recommendation of the concerned aircraft operator’.
The revised rules have also made it mandatory for the inspection of the airport to ensure its security. According to the revised rules, officials deployed from CAAN will visit the airport for safety survey, audit, inspection, security practices and evaluation of the activities.
An added provision in the amended rules states that aviation security inspectors deployed by CAAN must be allowed free access to all areas, including those termed ‘restricted’ in the airport and the concerned authority must submit all the details sought by the inspector.
Moreover, while the airport authority was earlier allowed to issue airport entry passes to people other than passengers, the revised rules has a provision that requires approval of the civil aviation office at the airports for such entry passes henceforth.

The country’s exports surged by 23.9 per cent in the first quadrimester of 2019-20 fiscal year, while imports fell by 6.9 per cent, as per the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB).
As per ‘Current Macroeconomic and Financial Situation of Nepal’ report of the first four months of the current fiscal unveiled by the central bank today, Nepal exported merchandise goods worth Rs 36.28 billion compared to an increase of 11 per cent a year ago.
Similarly, merchandise imports decreased to Rs 450.3 billion against an increase of 35.8 per cent in the same period of the previous year.
While the exports of palm oil, cardamom, yarn (polyester and other), jute goods, medicine (ayurvedic), among others, has increased in the review period, imports of MS billet, petroleum products, gold, aircraft spare parts, cement, among others, decreased in the review period.
Due to rise in exports and fall in imports, Nepal’s trade deficit narrowed by 8.9 per cent to Rs 414.02 billion in the four months of 2019-20.
Such deficit had expanded by 37.8 per cent in the same period of the previous year.

The NRB report shows that balance of payments (BoP) remained at a surplus of Rs 27.29 billion in the review period against a deficit of Rs 57.33 billion in the same period of last fiscal.
However, the current account registered a deficit of Rs 37.3 billion in the review period against a deficit of Rs 88.43 billion in the same period of previous year.
As per NRB, the number of Nepali workers (institutional and individual — new and legalised) that migrated for foreign employment increased by 5.6 per cent in the review period. The number had plunged by 39.4 per cent in the same period of the previous year.
However, despite the rise in outflow of Nepali migrant workers, remittance inflow slipped by 2.3 per cent to Rs 304.96 billion in the review period against an increase of 36.4 per cent in the same period of the previous year.
Meanwhile, the year-on-year consumer price inflation stood at 5.76 per cent in mid-November compared to 4.15 per cent a year ago.
Food and beverage inflation stood at 7.96 per cent whereas non-food and service inflation stood at 4.07 per cent in the review month.
“Within the food and beverage group, prices of vegetables, fruits, meat and fish and spices sub-groups rose significantly, while prices of housing and utilities, clothes and footwear and education subgroups within the non-food and service group rose moderately in the review month,” reads the report.

Private telecom company Ncell has acquired additional spectrum in the 1,800 megahertz bandwidth through the frequency auction held today for residual spectrum in the given bandwidth.

At the first-ever spectrum auction by Nepal Telecommunications Authority today, Ncell became the highest bidder for frequency in the 1,800 MHz bandwidth surpassing the state-owned Nepal Telecom.
Ncell became the highest bidder in the spectrum auction with a bid amount of Rs 58 million per MHz, while NT had made a bid of Rs 50 million per MHz.
Earlier, NTA had called for spectrum auction for available 16 MHz in the 1,800 MHz bandwidth. Of the total 75 MHz available in the 1,800 MHz bandwidth, telecom companies are already using 59 MHz. Telecom companies prefer 1,800 MHz bandwidth for GSM and 4G technology.
Initially, NTA had called for spectrum auction for available frequencies across all 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz bandwidths. However, auction across two other bandwidths could not take place as Ncell was the only company to express interest in the frequency auction of 900 MHz and 2,100 MHz bandwidths.
Even though it is the highest bidder, Ncell will not be able to purchase all the available remaining 16 MHz in the 1,800 MHz bandwidth as telecom companies are limited to use maximum of 20 MHz in any bandwidth. As Ncell already uses 11 MHz in the 1,800 MHz bandwidth, it can now purchase maximum of 9 MHz in the bandwidth.
Similarly, Ncell would not be allowed to immediately use the additional spectrum in the 1,800 MHz that the company won today. As the company is facing tax issues, NTA had allowed Ncell’s participation in the spectrum auction today only on the condition that it will use additional spectrum in the given bandwidth (if it becomes the highest bidder) only after it clears all its tax liabilities, including capital gains tax.
The spectrum auction notice had mentioned that telecom companies had to either have a basic telephony service licence or unified licence, clear all dues including royalty, RTDF and spectrum fees to be eligible to participate.
“Though Ncell was the highest bidder in the spectrum auction held today, NTA would allow the company to use additional frequency in the 1,800 MHz band only after Ncell cleared its tax liabilities to the government,” informed Min Prasad Aryal, spokesperson for NTA.
Based on specifications set by NTA for participating in the spectrum auction, no other telecom company could participate in the frequency auction except NT and Ncell. Citing that NTA was biased, CG Telecom had filed a case in the Supreme Court a week ago seeking stay on the NTA’s frequency auction process. Had the apex court complied and issued a stay order, the spectrum auction would have been cancelled.
Interestingly, the Supreme Court today issued a show-cause notice to NTA on the spectrum auction process soon after the auction process was completed.

As the country is gradually becoming self-reliant in cement production, domestic manufacturers are worried of surplus production.
Just a few years back, the country was dependent on India for cement and clinker. However, with the huge local and foreign investment in the cement industry, the country is now becoming self-reliant. While the annual demand of cement in the country is 800 million tonnes, total production capacity of cement factories in Nepal currently stands at almost 1,200 million tonnes per annum.
More than 50 cement factories are producing cement in the country at present and there are more factories in the pipeline. “In such a situation, we have no other option than to export our products,” said Pashupati Murarka, promoter of Arghakhachi Cement.
“After the 2015 earthquakes, demand of clinker increased in the market for reconstruction works. Our production was getting a good market due to reconstruction activities and the government’s initiative to bolster infrastructure construction,” Murarka said. “Now the reconstruction phase is almost coming to an end and the demand for clinker is less than the supply in the market.”
He further said that the solution could be either to increase internal consumption, for which more infrastructure projects need to be built or manufacturers need to focus on exporting the cement produced in the country.
“We are capable of exporting clinker, but the government has to support us in reducing production cost,” Murarka said.
“The country is becoming self-reliant in electricity, so it could reduce electricity rate for cement factories,” he opined.
According to him, cement factories have to import coal from South Africa and based on bilateral treaty of Nepal and India, importing coal from third countries via India is not allowed. “If the government amends the treaty with India, our production cost will be reduced,” Murarka said, adding, “Likewise, local governments have to remove extra charges to industry. Then only will our prices be competitive in the international market so that we can export clinker.”
Likewise, Nepal is also self-reliant in steel and its production has been rising in the market.
Currently, the country is producing around 2.2 to 2.3 million tonnes of steel. However, the market demand has remained constant for the last two years at 1.1 million tonnes, said Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, promoter of Shree Steels.
“The market demand is almost half the total production,” he said. “Based on the increasing population and financial status of the country, the demand had to increase, however, it has remained steady for the last two years.”
There is no other option than to export to manage supply and demand of steel, Agrawal added.

Though the government, through the budget for 2019-20 fiscal, had announced that it would observe the ongoing fiscal as the year to implement projects, the lethargic expenditure of development budget hints at a slow pace of development activities in the country.
According to statistics maintained by the Financial Comptroller General Office, the government has managed to spend only Rs 37.49 billion or 9.05 per cent of the total Rs 408 billion budget allocated for capital expenditure for fiscal 2019-20.

Though the government, especially the Ministry of Finance, has been saying it will address the perennial problem of low capital spending through different measures, none of its measures have been able to accelerate the spending.
“Budget implementation is dependent on cooperation and coordination among different ministries and the MoF alone cannot expedite the pace of spending,” said Uttar Kumar Khatri, spokesperson for MoF.
He added that the country’s capital expenditure would continue to be sluggish unless the Public Procurement Act was amended. “The act is in the process of being reviewed.”
FCGO’s statistics also show that the government has been able to spend Rs 14.17 billion or 8.44 per cent on financing of the total allocated budget of over Rs 167 billion for the ongoing fiscal.
The government has managed to spend nearly Rs 247 billion under recurrent expenditure till today
of the total allocated Rs 957 billion. Recurrent expenditure is primarily the spending of the government on non-capital formation programmes, such as salaries of government staffers, social security and other expenses.
However, the government’s total budget spending, including capital expenditure, financing and recurrent, during the period stood at Rs 298.6 billion or 19.48 per cent of the total budget of Rs 1.53 trillion for the ongoing fiscal year.
Experts have been saying that the government will not be able to accelerate capital budget spending unless a proper budget implementation plan is introduced and implemented.
“The problem lies in project planning and execution. We need to first enhance the capacity of our bureaucrats to plan and execute,” said economist Biswo Poudel, adding that slow spending of the budget is the result of lack of proper project planning, weak policy execution capacity of the bureaucracy and weak project execution capacity of contractors.

34,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/current-slowdown-in-credit-disbursement-is-a-temporary-phenomenon/,"Bhuvan Kumar Dahal, chief executive officer of Sanima Bank, was recently elected the president of Nepal Bankers’ Association unanimously and will assume the office from January 4. Dahal, who is often regarded as a friendly banker, will lead the representative organisation of commercial banks at a time when banks are being criticised for only focusing on profit-making. Moreover, issues regarding interest rate volatility, security in the banking system and bankers’ unwillingness to participate in the social security scheme of the government have gripped the market these days, which Dahal says will be his key focus areas during his two-year tenure in the association. Against this backdrop, Sujan Dhungana of The Himalayan Times caught up with Dahal to discuss the issues facing the banking sector and his plans to cope with them. Excerpts: 
Of late, credit disbursement from banks is dwindling as they are exercising caution. What is preventing banks from floating adequate loans? 
If we analyse the data, the growth of loans is still higher than the growth in deposits. In the first four months and three weeks of the current fiscal, deposits in banks grew by Rs 110 billion, while loan disbursement increased by Rs 154 billion. Similarly, since mid-September, credit disbursement surged by Rs 23 billion while deposit collection rose by Rs 16 billion. But it is true that loan growth has been tepid compared to the same period of the last fiscal year. There are a few reasons behind it. Construction activities across the country have slowed down lately and so has the production of cement and steel as contractors are currently protesting seeking amendment in the Public Procurement Act and continuation of different projects. Along with this, the stricter income tax compliance adopted by the government and a sort of frustration in the banking sector following the arrest of banker and former chief executive officer of Bank of Kathmandu Ajaya Shrestha have also affected the mood. Banks have clear division of works on areas related to valuation, collateralisation and loan. Frauds are always smart. If a staff of a bank’s branch office is cheated or was himself/herself involved in the fraud, staffers in the head office of the bank will be completely unaware of it. The head office of a bank cross-checks the process and files and authenticates it. But the recent treatment of banker Shrestha has caused frustration among the CEOs as we now need to think twice before signing any document. Banks across the world follow principles adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), which is an association of central banks of different countries. As per BCBS, there are certain risks inherent in the banking sector such as related to credit, market, liquidity and operations. Recent issue of ATM theft and other hacking incidents in the banking system come under operational risks. Banks across the world have adopted a policy to put aside 15 per cent of their gross income to manage operational risks. Thus, we have a mechanism to bear losses that may be incurred due to such risks. It is not that the loss is passed down to consumers. Few errors are inevitable in thousands of banking transactions and banking sector can absorb such losses. While we should be penalised if our direct involvement is found and someone might cheat a bank by taking advantage of its weaknesses, but it is wrong to assume a banker is involved in every banking fraud. The judiciary in Nepal and the police administration are not very knowledgeable about the banking sector. But that is basically because the central bank and bankers like us have been unable to make them comprehend how the banking business operates. All these issues have certainly resulted in frustration and demotivation in the banking sector. But I see that the demand for loan is not going to slow down in Nepal as expansionary works are under way. The current slowdown in loan is a temporary phenomenon and will pick up soon.
Banks and the private sector often lock horns on interest rate issues. When will the issue of interest rate volatility be sorted out? 
I think of the dispute between the banks and private sector on interest rate as similar to that between a house owner and tenants. It is normal for the lender to try to hike the interest rate, whereas for the borrower to seek lower rate. It is a natural process. We should be clear that interest rate is determined by demand and supply principle and banks have no role in controlling it. Moreover, the central bank has set 4.4 per cent spread for banks and we should comply with it.
One of the major complaints of the private sector is that the interest rate on loans issued at one point of time keeps increasing. Why is this so? 
I don’t think this is the case at present though such incidents had happened a few years ago. We also should not forget that lending rate had come down to as low as 6.5 per cent at some point in time. It is a human tendency to take notice when the interest rate goes up, but not when it comes down. Banks had also raised interest rate on deposits to as high as 12 per cent, which is often not discussed. But as of today, the lending rate has been connected to the base rate of a bank. This means that if base rate increases, banks can increase their lending rate and vice versa.
Though you mentioned earlier that interest rate is determined by supply and demand principle, banks were once seen as promoting cartel in interest rate. What do you have to say on this? 
Banks are not in favour of cartel. We cannot breach the interest rate spread of Nepal Rastra Bank. Cartel is often practised for profit-making. Had we practised it, our profit would have gone up significantly.

Banks have recorded a minimal 0.41 per cent operating profit before provisional growth in the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal though credit growth during the same period is almost 16 per cent. Had we practised cartel, our profit should have increased in line with rise in credit disbursement. We came to an understanding on interest rate at one point purely for the betterment of the economy and the banking sector.
Banks have expressed reservations regarding the new spread calculation method introduced by the central bank. Can you please elaborate? 
We should not look into absolute volume of profit made by a bank but rather at its volume compared to the investment. We should clearly understand that the return on equity (RoE) of banks is 15 per cent. This means that if we have invested Rs 100, we are making profit of Rs 15. So, RoE of 15 per cent where the interest rate on deposits is above 10 per cent is certainly not high as so many risks are inherent in the banking business. If we calculate risk-free returns for banks, it is only 10 per cent. Once the circular on new spread is implemented, the RoE of banks will come down to 10 per cent. Targeting the banking sector stating its RoE is high brings to fore questions about other sectors where the RoE is even higher than 15 per cent. A strong banking sector is a boon for the economy. In fact, some economists have accredited our enhanced banking sector for Nepal’s improvement in the doing business index. It is not that banks should make extremely high profit but around 20 per cent RoE is not bad. We have requested the central bank governor and finance minister to reconsider the spread calculation decision. The allegations of banks only being profit-centric at present are unfounded as the RoE in the sector some six-seven years ago was as high as 22 per cent. Banks today have reached all nooks and corners of the country. Over the last three years, the number of branches of commercial banks has reached 3,935 from 1,895, deposit accounts have reached 24.2 million from 13.5 million, loan accounts have reached 1.08 million from 761,000, mobile banking users have reached 8.1 million from 1.74 million, the number of debit card users has reached 6.5 million from 4.3 million and credit card users have reached 137,000 from 55,000. These statistics show how drastically Nepal’s banking sector has been expanding and enhancing. It is rather unfortunate to be criticised though we are giving our level best for the development of the country and economy. Our banking sector is almost at par with international banks. They are ahead only in the technology front.
The market has been facing a perennial crisis of loanable funds since the past few years. How long do you think will the crisis continue? 
The credit to capital plus deposit ratio (CCD) in the banking sector today is around 77 per cent. This means that banking sector still has the capacity to lend up to Rs 90 billion. Import has come down and export has gone up, while the balance of payments situation is positive. As credit disbursement has slowed down lately, we expect the liquidity situation to tighten a bit later this fiscal, probably from around mid-January. But if the demand for loan continues to slow, I even see chances of no liquidity problem this year. However, the demand for loans is bound to go up along with acceleration in development works.
To ease liquidity and assure availability of resources, NRB has allowed banks to borrow funds from foreign financial institutions. Is Sanima planning to bring in foreign funds? 
We are currently in talks with a few international parties on this issue. But foreign financial institutions seek country rating and look into other issues to issue funds.
Where is Sanima Bank in the merger and acquisition process? 
Personally, I am a pro-merger banker, as consolidation will have synergy effect. But merger may not work every time. We have formed a merger committee and it is searching for a suitable partner. Merger is not an easy job as the process has to undergo various cohesion and cultural issues between two firms. Janata Bank and Global Bank have recently merged. If this merger becomes successful, other banks will follow it.
Banks have been reluctant to join the social security scheme of the government citing biasness in the policy. Where actually is the problem? 
Banks always support programmes of the government. Banks and its employees are already registered at the Citizen Investment Trust (CIT) and Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and these entities have been giving certain facilities to us and our staffers. Now the recent call is to switch to Social Security Fund from the aforementioned two entities but at the cost of the facilities they were providing. If the government is unable to improve on the facilities being provided by CIT and EPF, the Social Security Fund should at least provide the same facilities. Once this happens, we will certainly switch to the fund.

Under the second phase of TIA rehabilitation work, the taxiway construction has been completed and handed over to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) tonight by the contractor company, China National Aero-technology International Engineering Corporation.
With this, the airport will resume 21 hours of operation.
Prior to this, the airport had halted flight operations from 11:00 pm to 6:00 am for airport maintenance work from September 1.

Along with the taxiway rehabilitation, taxiway-runway link road rehabilitation, and installation of runway centreline light has also been completed and now the airport will resume its fullfledged operation, informed Debendra KC, general manager of TIA.
He further said that the airport will start operating for 21 hours from January 1, along with the inauguration of Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign and the declaration of TIA as the country’s first boutique airport.
The work to upgrade TIA into a boutique airport has also achieved 90 per cent progress so far. As stated by CAAN, the exterior decoration of the international terminal building has already been completed. Likewise, around 50 wi-fi access points are also being installed in the waiting, departure and arrival areas, to facilitate internet access in the terminal zones.
This is the largest maintenance work ever at the country’s sole international airport since its establishment.
The runway that had started developing cracks in 2014 had further deteriorated after the 2015 earthquakes.
The runway areas, especially from the 02 point up to 1,600 metres ahead, had been largely damaged and were in a pathetic condition.
Hence, both the rehabilitation and airport expansion work were carried out simultaneously from March.

The programme was organised on August 16 and 17 at Kanjirowa National Secondary School in collaboration with Robotics Association of Nepal (RAN) and Nepal Robotics Project, USA, according to a press release issued by the organiser.

The main aim of the training was to promote STEM — focusing on both the practical and theoretical aspects of robotics in Nepal, reads the statement. As many as 28 participants from 18 schools were involved in learning about the fundamentals of STEM education, drone making, aerodynamics, principles of flying, among others.
Kapil Dev Regmi, Chairman of Kanjirowa School, highlighted that Nepal’s education system required a practical approach to encourage the students for innovation and research rather than promoting rote learning. He was hopeful that such training will be given priority in more schools in future.
Participating teachers had an opportunity to interact with one another and share their experiences on the condition of STEM education in Nepal. The programme was led by some innovative engineers having extensive knowledge of robotics and latest technological advancements in the field.
Michael Kronmiller from Nepal Robotics Project, US, Aliyah Pandoliff from Kashmir World Foundation, US, and Prof Sandra Magnus, former NASA Scientist and Astronaut sent messages for the success of the programme and expressed their interests to work further with Kanjirowa in STEM education in the future too.
Theodore Kronmiller, former US ambassador has been an inspiration to Kanjirowa in its STEM education, according to the statement.

42,https://thehimalayantimes.com/education/government-bars-pupils-from-pursuing-non-academic-courses-abroad/,"Kathmandu, June 12
Nepali students, who wish to pursue non-academic courses, like vocational education or language courses in countries such as Australia and Japan, will not be allowed to do so from now onwards, thanks to the government’s radical move aimed at curtailing the rights of high school graduates to make choices. What’s more, students who have not completed Grade XII will not be allowed to study abroad.
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology published a notice today stating that students who have completed Grade XII or equivalent will be given ‘no objection letters’ to study abroad only if they intend to pursue academic courses of bachelor’s level or above.
Students cannot study abroad without obtaining ‘no objection letters’. These letters are also essential to get foreign currency exchange facility.

“We will issue no objection letters even to those who wish to pursue technical and vocational education, language courses and academic bridge courses, which are similar to language courses. But those students will have to provide evidence to substantiate they will get enrolled in a university to pursue academic courses after completing vocational or language courses,” said MoEST Under-secretary Maheshwor Sharma.
This move will largely affect students intending to study in Australia. Many Australia-bound Nepali students join technical and vocational institutions. This is common among those pursuing nursing.
Technical and vocational education, which is a non-academic course, generally prepares students for the job market, as it is designed by conducting studies on the needs of several industries. Countries such as Australia, Germany and Switzerland are well known for their technical and vocational education courses.
The latest move will also hit students who leave for Japan to pursue language courses. Many of them have not even passed Grade XII.
The latest provision introduced by the government clearly states that students will not be given permission to study abroad if they have not completed Grade XII. At present, not many students prefer to study abroad before passing Grade XII, but the new provision prevents parents who can afford to, or students who wish to, from doing so.
“The new provisions were introduced on the basis of the law which states that students can only get enrolled in foreign institutions if they intend to pursue higher education,” said Sharma. He added, “We now define higher education as tertiary education and not education attained in Grade XI and XII.” Earlier, the government used to define education provided in grades XI and XII as higher education. This has changed after the government started recognising grades XI and XII as a part of high school.
“The government should not have introduced such a provision without holding consultation with stakeholders. This blanket provision will not do good to students planning to study abroad. Students should be allowed to go abroad if they can attain quality education,” said Kedar Bhakta Mathema, former vice-chancellor of Tribhuvan University.

Loughlin, who starred in the television sitcom “Full House,” and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli filed papers in federal court in Boston waiving their personal appearances at an arraignment hearing and asking to have not guilty pleas entered on their behalf.
They are among 50 people accused of participating in a massive scheme that allowed wealthy parents to use cheating and $25 million in bribes to help their children secure spots at well-known universities like Yale, Georgetown and USC.
California college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer pleaded guilty in March to charges that helped parents facilitate cheating on college entrance exams and bribed coaches at universities to falsely present their children as athletic recruits.
Prosecutors allege that Loughlin (54) and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USC’s crew team, even though they did not row competitively, to help them gain admission.
Loughlin and Giannulli provided Singer photographs of their daughters in order to create fake athletic profiles for them, which a USC athletics official in exchange for bribes then used to support recruiting them, prosecutors said.
The couple and several other parents were originally charged in March with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Prosecutors secured an indictment on April 9 that included an additional charge of conspiring to commit money laundering.
Several other parents charged alongside Loughlin and Giannulli also filed papers seeking to waive appearing at an arraignment and have not guilty pleas entered for them. A federal magistrate judge granted their requests on Monday.
In all, 33 parents have been charged in the college admissions scandal. Of those, 13 have agreed to plead guilty, including “Desperate Housewives” TV star Felicity Huffman. She is scheduled to plead guilty on May 21.

ULYSSES, KANSAS: A 16-year-old Kansas boy will soon earn his high school diploma — and a few days later he’ll travel to Harvard to collect his bachelor’s degree.
Ulysses High School senior Braxton Moral will attend both commencement ceremonies in May, becoming the only student to successfully pursue a four-year high school degree and a bachelor’s degree from Harvard at the same time, The Hutchinson News reported .
Harvard has changed the rules, Braxton’s father Carlos Moral said, so his son will “the one and only” reaching that milestone. Braxton Moral will be 17 when he gets his diplomas.
Carlos Moral said they began to realize their son was special when he was in the third grade.
“They told us: ‘You need to do something. He’s not just gifted. He’s really, really gifted,’” he said.
Braxton Moral skipped the fourth grade.
The Ulysses school district allowed him to take some high school classes while he was still in middle school. Before high school he took a class offered at Fort Hays State University. Then he was admitted into Harvard.
Braxton Moral simultaneously studied at the high school and the Harvard Extension School. The program typically serves adults who work and can’t attend classes on campus full time.
Ulysses High School math teacher Patsy Love served as the proctor for the Harvard program, administering Moral’s tests in Kansas. Moral spent the summer before his junior year at Harvard’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
“We constantly are monitoring Braxton to make sure he is not too overwhelmed,” said Julie Moral, Braxton Moral’s mother. “No achievement is worth him being unhappy.”
Braxton Moral is on track to graduate from the Bachelor of Liberal Arts program, with a major government and a minor in English, said Harry Pierre, associate director of communications for Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education.
Braxton Moral said he hopes to attend Harvard Law School next.
“Politics is end game for me,” he said, though he’s still too young to vote.

The college agreed to provide the forms after a student lodged a complaint at ‘Hello Sarkaar’ section of the Prime Minister’s Office in Kathmandu, arguing that as the college did not provide re-totalling and migration forms, students were compelled to buy these from stationery where the owners denied them VAT bill.
The complaint was forwarded to Tribhuvan University with priority. It was later forwarded to the TU Office of the Controller of Examinations by Information and Public Relations Division of the University.
Consequently, all colleges in the eastern region of the country have been directed to ensure availability of the forms inside college premises. Joint Controller of Examinations, Arjun Bikram Khadka, shared this information.

Sagarmatha Engineering College (SEC) and its sister concern Sagarmatha College of Science And Technology, in collaboration with Zobfindr, organised the ‘Internship and Placement Fair’ with the theme ‘Sagarmatha – Institution to Industry’ in its college premises in Sanepa, Lalitpur, on November 17.
The event was organised targeting fresh graduates and eighth-semester students of IT and Engineering for internship and job placement.
Students of BE Civil, BE Computer, BE Electronics and Communication, and BSc CSIT from various colleges across the country received an opportunity of an on-the-spot interview for internship and job at a single venue. On-the-spot interview with top IT and engineering companies of Nepal was the main highlight of the event.
Dakshina Shrestha, Associate Professor and Head of Training and Placement Unit said, “The event was organised with an objective of helping students liaise with the industry and job market to make a smooth transition from college to corporate life. Many graduates were placed by online interviews. Overall, it was a win-win situation for both companies and graduates. The feedback we received was excellent. We were requested to organise such event every year.”
Sixteen of the leading Nepali companies working in the field of information technology and engineering like Javra Software, Leapfrog, Vianet, Karkhana, Fuse Machine, Wikimedians Nepal, among others had participated in the event.
One of the representatives from Javra Software, Technical Manager Dev Narayan said, “When I came here I expected a huge crowd, and students seeking jobs. That is what happened. I feel this is a good initiative taken by the college. I feel, definitely, a lot of engineers will be selected through the event.”
The event witnessed a participation of around 700 students.

Courtesy: AP
BOSTON: The latest crop of US Rhodes scholars has more women than any other single class, and almost half of this year’s recipients of the prestigious scholarship to Oxford University in England are either immigrants or first-generation Americans, the Rhodes Trust announced Sunday.
Among the 32 winners is Harvard University senior Jin Park, the first recipient covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation.
Park, 22, of the New York City borough of Queens, arrived from South Korea with his parents when he was 7, studied molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, and founded a nonprofit to help undocumented students apply to college.
He hopes to become an immigrant advocate, saying it’s important for him to use the opportunity to better others, not just himself.
“When you grow up as an undocumented immigrant in America, that understanding that your talents don’t really belong to you in the traditional sense, that you have to share the fruits of your labor with others, that’s just something you learn,” Park said.
Alaleh Azhir, a 21-year old senior at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, emigrated from Iran when she was 14 — and is also one of 21 female scholars named Sunday. The New York City resident hopes eventually to become a doctor and will study women’s and reproductive health at Oxford.
“I’m just a passionate advocate for women in general and that’s mostly because of my background,” she said. “I thought that the way I could advocate for women could be by advocating for their health.”
At Chapman University in Southern California, Vidal Arroyo, 21, reflected on his unlikely path to becoming his school’s first Rhodes Scholar.
“As a Latino, a first-generation college student, and a train commuter to college, winning this scholarship means so much to me because it sheds hope for students from backgrounds like my own who have to overcome multiple barriers in pursuit of a higher education and a better future,” said Arroyo, who plans to study engineering science at Oxford.
And Eren Orbey, a 23-year-old senior at Yale University in Connecticut, whose parents emigrated from Turkey, hopes studying at Oxford will bring greater “context and clarity” to his writing. He is a regular contributor to The New Yorker magazine and is working on a book about his father, who was slain in Ankara when he was just 3, and the killer.
“I’m interested in studying the ethics of revenge and forgiveness,” Orbey said Sunday by email. “I think that our culture and media coverage often condescend to immigrants and survivors of trauma. In my writing, I hope to recast tragedy and strife as occasions for growth and heroism.”
The US Rhodes scholars join a separate, international group of scholars representing more than 60 countries.
Rhodes Scholarships provide all expenses for at least two years of study at Oxford. They were created in 1902 in the will of Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman and Oxford alum who was a prime minister of the Cape Colony in present-day South Africa.

LONDON: Football legend David Beckham has visited Indonesia – where one in three children have been physically attacked in school – to see how his charity, the 7 Fund, is combating bullying.
The A-list celebrity and former England captain launched the fund to protect the world’s most vulnerable youngsters in 2015 with the United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF).
“I feel very proud to see how my 7 Fund is helping UNICEF tackle bullying and violence in schools in Indonesia, and is ultimately keeping children, especially girls, safe in their schools so they can continue their education,” he said.
Bullying and violence are among the biggest worries for young people in Indonesia, with more than 1 in 5 teens aged 13 to 15 – or 18 million students – experiencing it, leading to mental health problems and school dropouts, UNICEF said.
The 7 Fund teaches children who have been bullied and former bullies to educate others and trains teachers to keep children safe. Bullying has been reduced by almost a third among the 7,000 children who have taken part in pilot programmes, it said.
“I spent time with an amazing young girl – Sripun – who was voted by her peers to take part in an anti-bullying programme to help stop violence in schools,” Beckham said in a statement.
“This has increased her confidence and she’s hopeful that other students won’t have to go through the same bullying experience she did.”
The fund — named after Beckham’s lucky number on his England and Manchester United shirts — focuses on children at risk of violence, abuse or disease.
Beckham, a father of four, has said that he hopes his own children will be proud of his work with the 7 Fund, which also has projects in Indonesia, Nepal, Uganda and El Salvador.

Vice-chairman of National Planning Commission Swarnim Wagle has said that setting the educational agenda has been a great challenge in the country.
Speaking at the 18th Annual General Meeting of Educational Journalist Group here today, he said the government had to give priority to education.
“The quality of education should be improved now that the local levels are responsible for handling and managing school education,” he said.
Around 40 per cent of budget is being sent to the local levels and preparations are also on to hand over different projects currently being handled by different non-governmental organisations to the local levels.
Similarly, former education minister Dhaniram Paudel said despite the handover of the education system to the local levels, the Ministry of Education, Department of Education and district education offices should handle the education system.
Madhu Prasad Regmi, secretary at the Ministry of Education, said 23 responsibilities of the education sector had been given to the local levels without hampering the educational system.
As all the basic and secondary schools are being handled by the local levels it will be easy to manage resources for the education sector from local resources, he added.
On the occasion, Mathura Yadav principal of Tribeni Primary School, Rupandehi, and Devi Khadka Pokhrel, member of School Management Committee of Kamala Secondary School, Sindhuli were honored at the programme.

Kathmandu
Teachers are guides for students providing students with valuable knowledge, which help students to excel in their studies as well as life in general. Teachers with decades of teaching experience in various colleges share important tips.

Study on a regular basis
Teachers suggest that students should give regular time to their studies. However, they say there is no fixed hours that they should set aside.
“Regular reading is a must,” says Bharat Kumar Bhattarai, who has 30 years of experience as a Nepali lecturer. He suggests students to prepare notes right from the beginning of the academic year and go through it regularly.
Saroj Pyakurel, Accounting lecturer in different colleges in Kathmandu, says that there is no fixed hours that students should give to their studies. However, according to Pya-kurel, who has 14 years of teaching experience, students should give as much time as they can daily, in which they would be able to understand the lessons taught every day. “Students themselves should decide how much time they should give regularly on a daily basis so they understand the lessons,” he suggests. He stresses that during holidays too, students should set aside at least three hours for revisions.
Educationist Prof Dr Bidya Nath Koirala says that the time students should give to their studies depends upon their nature. Some students learn fast and some slowly, so students themselves should find out how much time they should give to their studies according to their learning ability.

Tips for exam preparation
Educators suggest that students should go through all the topics of a subject in order to obtain good marks in exams.  Nepali lecturer Bhattarai suggests students to divide time according to the importance and marks of the topics. “For the exams you should not study selecting a few topics, but study all the topics in the text with the intention to understand each topic thoroughly.”
He says that students who select only few a topics to study for exams will not be able to do well. “Every topic in course is inter-related, and if students do not understand earlier topics, they will not be clear about the next chapter too,” he opines.
He also suggests students to prepare for exams by noting down important points of each chapter. Besides this, he says that students, who prepare notes from the beginning, will score good marks in exams as they will have already gained a deep knowledge of each chapter. However, he suggests avoiding using guides books and guess papers. “Students depending upon guide books and guess papers will ruin themselves,” he informs as “guide book writers are not responsible ones; they take it as a job and they are not responsible towards students’ progress.”

Be proactive
Students should not only depend upon the teachers’ notes but should also work on their own by studying reference materials, books from the library and doing online researches, as per the teachers.
“Teachers are limited within the circle of their knowledge and education, so students should also study and prepare from books by various writers. This will broaden their knowledge,” says Bhattarai.
Pyakurel also argues that students should not only depend upon their teachers and course books. “Students can benefit much from YouTube and Google as thousands of study materials are available there.”
He further says, “The mind is always motivated by desire, so students should also research on issues in which their interests lie.”

Questioning mind
Prof Dr Koirala says that raising questions is the most important feature of a learner. He says that students should always have questions in their mind and ask questions to themselves in order to learn. On any topic or issue, a student should ask questions: Why it is so? How did it happen? What is the mechanism behind it? How is it related with me? Raising such questions will make a student understand topics analytically, he says.

Clear vision
Sociology lecturer Uttam Prasad Devkota says that students should have a goal. Devkota has 13 years of experience in teaching.  “It is not that you study BBA because you completed your plus two level. Students should have a clear vision about their field of interest and about what they want to be in future,” points out Devkota. He adds that the students should not be limited to their course but should broaden their horizon by gaining knowledge on social, cultural, political and economic conditions of the country and people. Students should always notice what is happening in their society and country. This will make them explore the possibility of the current subject they are studying. They should not only prepare to get good results in exams but think of study and learning as a regular process, Devkota adds.

Kathmandu
Teej, one of the greatest festivals for Hindu women, is here. Students also celebrate this festival, and even if they don’t, they are affected by the festivities surrounding it as people from their friend circle or family members celebrate it. Sharing their views about this festival, they admit that the study environment college and homes is affected by the festival.
In celebratory mood
For most students the best aspect of this festival is that it strengthens the bond between female members in society as they meet and share their feelings with each other. They add that the singing, dancing and the celebration part of the festival is what they enjoy the most.
Nisha Khatiwada, a resident of Kapan and a Vth semester student of Bachelor of Public Health at the Karnali College of Health Sciences in Battisputali, says that it is fascinating to see women in red, dancing and singing folk songs on streets, going to temples in a holy and fasting mood.
Class environment
Rebecca Maghariya, a IVth year student of Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) at the Shanker Dev Campus in Putalisadak, says that as their college has no uniform, students come wearing red and green, or colourful kurta and also with mehendi on their hands two weeks prior to Teej. Maghariya is from Kailali and is currently residing in Thankot.
Maghariya’s classmate Pratiksha Gautam says Teej becomes a subject of all talks among classmates. Gautam hails from Rukum and is residing in Dillibazar. According to her, kind of clothes to wear and songs to sing during Teej become the main topics of talk in class starting a few weeks before the festival.
Effects on study
The students also admit they are distracted from their studies during the festival due to many reasons.
Neeru Poudel, a IVth Year BBS student at Shanker Dev Campus, says that the festival affected her when she was studying in BBS Ist Year as the board exam was on the same day. She was distracted from her studies as there was a celebratory environment at her home. According to her, this year too the BBS Ist Year board exams were scheduled on Teej but was postponed due to floods in Tarai. Poudel is from Syangja and residing in New Baneshwor. She says that music and other noise from Darr events at a nearby complex could be heard from her room. This disturbs her while doing her college assignments.
Umesh Bhakt Joshi, a IInd Year student of Bachelor of Law (LLB) at the Nepal Law Campus at Pradarshanimarg, says that around 50 per cent of female classmates in his class do not attend class from around two weeks prior to Teej. Joshi, from Bajhang and residing in Kirtipur, says almost all his female classmates are absent from Darr eating day till Rishi Panchami. He opines that as half the number of students remain absent, their lecturers show no interest in teaching and usually postpone classes for a week. There is also less possibility of female lecturers holding classes on those days, informs Joshi, adding that student unions in the college have organised Darr programme for students this year too as in previous years.
Shanta Bahadur Tamang of the Nepal Law Campus however, says that Teej celebration should not affect students regarding their studies as it depends upon students themselves on how to manage time. According to him, if some days are to be spent in celebrations, students should study those chapters early on or give extra time to the same after the festival ends.
Superstition
Apart from these aspects of Teej, Khatiwada said she does not believe bathing and performing other rituals on Rishi Panchami will purify women and earn them penance from the so-called mistakes they may have committed being and making others impure during periods. Such superstitions push women to an inferior position in society, she adds.

67,https://thehimalayantimes.com/education/the-hostel-life/,"Hasana Lawaju talks to college students who are living in hostels as they pursue their studies and finds out why students find it advantageous to stay in one


Hostel provides a good environment for studies — serious students take the best advantage while living in hostels. While there are the fun and challenges of living in a hostel, these are also the best places for students to live while pursuing their higher studies. Most students agree that they are motivated to study while saving their time as they attend their colleges while living in hostel.
Conducive study environment
Some students find hostel environment motivational to concentrate in their studies, especially during exams.  “Every student staying in a hostel usually has exams at the same time, and thus all are studying during that time,” says Bishwadeep Tamang, a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering, Bhaktapur. Tamang, who hails from Sankhuwasabha, is staying at Hostel Libali — a private hostel in Bhaktapur.
Tamang’s classmate as well as roommate Manish Dhakal echoes a similar view — “when a  friend is studying for exams at hostel, a competitive spirit develops among other friends, and as a result everyone is motivated to study”.
The motivation to study comes from seniors at her hostel for Manisha Khadka, Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) VIth Semester student.  Khadka, who studies at Padmakanya Multiple Campus, Baghbazar and stays in the college’s Pragya Chhatrawas, shares, “When I see my seniors — especially Master’s level students — studying sincerely, I am inspired to study properly.”
Living in a hostel with classmates becomes advantageous, especially when one misses a class or does not understand the topic taught in the classroom.  “Whenever I do not understand any topic taught by the teachers, I can consult my roommates or other friends in the hostel who have a better understanding of the topic,” points out Kshitij Dahal, BE (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering. Dahal also resides in Hostel Libali.
However, Sharmila Upadhyaya staying at Padma Girls Hostel in Pulchowk, has a different experience. Initially, when she started living in the hostel three-and-a-half years ago, it was difficult for her to adjust because she was not used to studying in group. But with time, she has gotten used to it.
Upadhyaya, BE (Computer Engineering) VIIIth Semester student at the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk,  shares her hostel offers a good environment for students as it “only selects students after checking their academic performances”.
Life made easier
Khadka’s hostel is next to her college premises. “It takes me only a few minutes to reach my hostel. So, my time is not wasted in travelling,” says Khadka, who hails from Butwal. Living near the college, she claims to utilise most of her time for studies.
Had Dhakal, whose house is in Kapan, chosen to commute to his college in Bhaktapur from his home “I would have spent at least four hours daily just travelling in bus”. Thanks to his decision to stay in a hostel, he is able to save valuable time.
The students also need not cook or do laundry and cleaning as most hostels provide students with food, laundry and other services.

“We do not need to cook, wash dishes or clothes, and it is convenient for us,” Tamang shares.
Along with that other facilities are available in the hostels. For instance, the three-and-a- half storey Pragya Chhatrawas has made one study hall available in each floor for students along with Wi-Fi facility, as per Geeta Tandukar, a third class officer at General Administration Division of the Padmakanya Multiple Campus.
Kutumba Boys Hostel, Jawalakhel receives students’ report cards from their respective colleges. “We wake the students up early in the morning, monitor their studies, talk to the parents if their children are not concentrating in their studies or have poor academic performances,” hostel coordinator Bandana Khatri reveals.
More than studies
Be it a hostel run by the college or a private one, most make students’ academics the priority. But they also provide opportunities for students to have fun. As such, the occasional celebrations in hostels are the best moments for students like Khadka. They celebrate Teachers’ Day where they offer treats to their teachers and also celebrate birthday of their hostel warden, as per Khadka.
Hostel wardens too support the students in such endeavours. Rakesh Machamasi, Warden of Hostel Libali informs, “We prepare delicacies like Dahi Chiura, Khir, Yomari et cetera  on different occasions for the hostel students and we all celebrate together. Our students find such celebrations interesting.”
Dissatisfaction 
Most students agree that hostels provide them with a good study environment. However, they have some dissatisfaction too, mostly about the food served.
“Sometimes, the food served by our hostel is not hygienic. At times I have found insects and hair in the food, though it does happen always,” complains Khadka.
Dahal has some objection with the meat-policy of his hostel. “Our hostel serves meat every Wednesday. But if I do not feel like eating on that day and want to have meat on some other day, that is not possible,” Dahal argues.
But Upadhyaya puts forth a different opinion. “It is not what we want to eat, but what is available. If we do not eat properly, no one in the hostel will convince us to eat. As such habits like not eating on time  can even affect our health. So, rather than complaining, we should learn to take care ourselves,” she opines.

68,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/virginia-biochemist-camille-schrier-is-crowned-miss-america/,"

UNCASVILLE: Organizers wanted to make it clear the 99th Miss America competition isn’t your grandmother’s beauty pageant, and their winner did just that on Thursday.
Virginia biochemist Camille Schrier won the crown just minutes after wowing the crowd with science. Dressed in a lab coat, she gave a colorful chemistry demonstration of the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.
Schrier, a native of Pennsylvania, said she hopes to “break stereotypes about what it means to be a Miss America in 2020” by being a “woman of science” who is authentic to herself.
“I’m not the beauty queen,” she said. “I’m the brand ambassador for this organization and I’m more than just someone with a crown on my head.”
Victoria Hill of Georgia placed first runner-up.
No longer called contestants, the 51 women “candidates,” who hailed from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, competed for a $50,000 scholarship and the “job” of Miss America, a one-year paid position they hope to use as a public platform for their “social impact initiative.”
For the second year in a row, women were not judged in a swimsuit or how they look in an evening gown. Instead, a series of interviews and talent demonstrations will determine who is best qualified to wear this year’s crown.
“To make it relevant for these young women, it was important for us as a scholarship and service organization to make sure that we were reflective of this generation, meaning that you no longer had to be defined by some sort of ideal,” said Regina Hopper, president & CEO of the Miss America Organization.
Schrier, 24, who spoke on stage about having tackled an eating disorder, said she decided to compete for Miss America after the swimsuit competition was ditched, along with other changes that have been made to modernize the organization.
“I kind of figured that I would never get on that stage because I was a woman who did not want to get into a swimsuit on stage. And I didn’t have a performing talent, which is really ironic now,” she said, adding how she’s the first Miss America to win with a science experiment, a presentation she brings to schools.
Schrier is a cum laude graduate of Virginia Tech with dual bachelor of science degrees in bio chemistry and systems biology and she is currently studying to obtain a doctor of pharmacy degree.￼ Her platform issue is drug safety.
Morgan Nichols, Miss South Carolina, had her own message on Thursday night. She walked down the red carpet wearing a billowing, long skirt topped by a plain white T-shirt that read: “Stronger.”
While Hopper acknowledges there has been some push-back from “old pageant” people who liked the old way of doing things, she said there’s been greater interest in the competition since the roll-out of Miss America 2.0.
When asked on stage whether the Miss America organization should change even more and allow married women and women with children to participate, both Schrier and Hill said no. Schrier told reporters afterward that she believes the job would be too busy for a mother.
This year also marked the first time the multi-day event is being held at Mohegan Sun, a tribal casino and entertainment complex in suburban southeastern Connecticut. Miss America organizers announced plans this summer to leave Atlantic City, New Jersey — for the second time in its history.
Miss America also switched from ABC back to NBC to broadcast the glitzy finale to an estimated 4.5 million viewers. And for the first time, preliminary events and the finale — held in Mohegan’s 10,000-seat arena — are being streamed live on the NBC app.
“We’ve had many, many large events. This probably reaches the most people,” said Jeff Hamilton, president and general manager of Mohegan Sun. “We’re just really, really excited about it.”
Miss America organizers and NBC have not yet agreed to a multi-year contract with the Connecticut casino. A decision is expected in the coming months.
Schrier succeeds 2019 Miss America Nia Franklin, a classically trained opera singer from New York.
The decision to drop the swimsuit competition did create great controversy and criticism of Miss America officials, including former board chair and former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, who said in 2018 that Miss America would represent “a new generation of female leaders focused on scholarship, social impact, talent and empowerment.” Carlson has since stepped down.
Atlantic City businessmen came up with the idea for a pageant in 1921 as a way to extend the summer tourism season beyond Labor Day weekend. It became synonymous with the New Jersey seaside resort but moved to Las Vegas in 2005, returning to Atlantic City in 2013.

TOKYO: Her timing can be terrible and she can pack a mean punch.
But “Little Miss Period” – a pink blob with red lips and red pants who stars in a Japanese manga comic and movie of the same name – has a mission: breaking taboos in a society where talking about menstruation has been seen dirty or embarrassing.

The character has generally been received positively as a step toward better understanding among the sexes. Some critics, though, worry about stereotypes and inattention to underlying gender discrimination that holds back Japanese women in many fields.
“Until now, menstruation has been something to hide and many people completely lack correct understanding of it,” said Kazue Muta, a sociology professor at Osaka University.
“I can’t praise the manga 100% … but it would be good if it were a step toward greater openness and education.”
The movie “Little Miss Period” was released domestically by entertainment company Yoshimoto Kogyo Co Ltd last month. It is based on a manga by male artist Ken Koyama that debuted in 2017 before being compiled into a book by publisher Kadokawa.
The film also opened in Taiwan this month and will debut in Hong Kong in January. Premieres in China and across Southeast Asia are also planned.
The topic of menstruation caught public attention in Japan recently when department store Daimaru suggested female employees wear a “period badge” to alert co-workers to their cycle. The plan sparked accusations of harassment and the store is reconsidering.
In the manga series, Little Miss Period – “Seiri-chan” in Japanese – delivers a punch to the gut that lays some women out flat before drawing blood with a syringe. When a woman’s husband fails to sympathise, he gets a “period punch” of his own to help him understand.
History gets a nod, with the tale of a feudal era Japanese girl forced to stay in a secluded hut because of the belief that menstruating females are unclean.
The movie version focuses on Aoko, a publishing firm editor whose male boss shows little compassion for her monthly pain. Aoko’s widower boyfriend is raising a young daughter. “If only men could get periods, even just once a year,” Aoko laments.
Feminist author Minori Kitahara welcomed efforts to break taboos but lamented that the representations were “treating the matter like a comedy talk show.”
Nobuyoshi Yoshida, 33, said he found the movie instructive. “Men don’t get how harsh menstruation can be for some women,” he said as he exited a cinema. “This was easy to understand.”
His girlfriend Kumiko Hanazawa, 32, was succinct: “I want men to watch this.”

70,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/anna-karina-the-icon-of-french-new-wave-cinema-dies-at-79/,"PARIS: Anna Karina, the French New Wave actress who became an icon of the cinema in the 1960s and was the muse of Jean-Luc Godard, has died. She was 79.
The French culture minister announced her death on Twitter on Sunday. French media said that the Danish-born Karina had cancer and died Saturday.

”Her look was the look of the New Wave. It will remain so forever,” Culture Minister Franck Riester tweeted.
“Anna Karina radiated. She magnetized the entire world,”‘ Riester said, adding that ”French cinema has lost one of its legends.”
Karina made seven films with Godard, her partner at the time, including the 1961 “Une Femme Est Une Femme” (A Woman is a Woman), in which she played a femme fatale. For that, she received the best actress award at the Berlin Film Festival. Other cult Godard movies starring Karina included the 1962 “Vivre Sa Vie'” (Live Your Life) and the 1965 “Pierrot Le Fou.”
Karina captured film-goers with her large blue doe eyes and acting and singing talents.
The French New Wave broke with traditional cinematic conventions to create a fresh approach to making movies, in keeping with the free-spirited times.
Godard wasn’t the only director with whom Karina worked. Jacques Rivette’s 1966 film “La Religieuse” (The Nun), adapted from the 18th-century French novel by Diderot, was initially banned. The story of a young woman forced into the convent by her mother, who had given birth out of wedlock, was revived in a restored version and presented at the 2018 Cannes film festival.
Born Hanne Karin Blarke Bayer in Denmark, she initially modelled and sang in cabarets before coming to France. She was reportedly discovered, and renamed, by Coco Chanel, then discovered by Godard.
Karina also worked, among other illustrious directors, with Luchino Visconti.
In a bold undertaking at the time, the actress later got behind the camera to make her own movie in 1973, “Vivre Ensemble” (Living Together).
Films that Karina has appeared in will be shown on the silver screen again with a retrospective of Godard starting next month at the Cinemateque, a noted film institution in France which she had frequented.

KATHMANDU: After successfully performing in Brisbane, Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart, Nepal’s famous folk-rock band, Nepathya, captivated the full-house audience at Big Top Auditorium in Luna Park of Sydney, Australia, on Saturday.
Performing for the fifth time in Sydney, Nepathya, entertained the audience with their mix of old and new songs with a great effect of the latest technology at the sold-out auditorium this weekend.
With this show, Sydney hosted Nepathya’s concert for the record fifth time. Nepathya has already performed more than five times in Kathmandu, Pokhara, Butwal, Chitwan, Hetauda and Dhangadhi within Nepal.
As the show went on, band’s lead singer and social activist Amrit Gurung said, “I still remember our first concert ten years ago as there were fewer Nepalis living in Sydney. However, during the last decade, Nepali diaspora has migrated looking for opportunities all over the globe.”
“Nepal would be a prosperous nation if it could do enough to stop the flow of brain-drain in the near future,” Amrit Gurung added.
“I see future in youths like you, who have gained knowledge, skills and experience in a foreign land, to transform the course of the nation like ours. Although our predecessors failed to create opportunities for us, we should be able for the next generation in Nepal, “Amrit Gurung shared.
As usual, Gurung was supported by Dhurba Lama on drums, Suraj Thapa on keyboards, Subin Shakya on bass guitar, Niraj Gurung on guitars and Shanti Raymajhi on madal.
After the Sydney show, Nepathya’s concert entourage will head to final stop-over in Melbourne to perform on December 23, the band said.
Nepathaya is currently touring Australia for the fifth time with new music series.

74,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/lemonade-by-beyonce-is-named-the-aps-album-of-the-decade/,"NEW YORK: The top 15 albums of the decade by Associated Press Music Editor Mesfin Fekadu:

Beyoncé, “Lemonade”: At the beginning of this decade, Beyoncé was already the greatest singer of her generation. She won a record six Grammys in a single night, had women AND MEN “oh-oh-oh’ing” to the fun sound of “Single Ladies” and continued to be a beast of a performer. But somehow Superwoman — shoot, she’s Superman, too! — found a way to do more: Like a boss she launched her own company, Parkwood Entertainment, and really took the bull by the horns of her career. In 2011, she released the R&B adventure “4,” featuring classics like “Countdown,” “Love on Top,” “Party,” “End of Time,” “I Care” and “I Miss You.” Three years later — in surprise form — came “Beyoncé,” her bold, audacious and daring album that showcased a new side of Beyoncé: Goodbye was the girl who cared about topping the charts, and born was an artist, a true storyteller, a grown woman. Somehow, she topped herself again with “Lemonade,” which still tastes as good as it did when it was released in 2016. The usually private Beyoncé bares her soul on the album, singing about a troubled relationship, black pride and motherhood in a brave way. Lyrically, she’s on point and honest over beats and sounds that range from rap to rock to country and pop. “Who the (expletive) do you think I am,” she brashly asks on “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” which co-stars Jack White. The answer: the greatest of all time.
Rihanna, “Anti”: Something was in the water in 2016: Beyoncé delivered “Lemonade” and Rihanna gave us the best album of her career with “Anti.” Rihanna had been moving like the Energizer Bunny since releasing her first album in 2005. She also put out albums in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 — showing that she was a singer who knew how to pick a hit, record it and make it sound better than any other artist could. But she took four years to create “Anti,” and the time was used wisely. No need to hit the skip button on this album as Rihanna shows her sultry side on “Kiss It Better,” her twerk side on “Work” and her vocal chops on “Love on the Brain.” Her hard work, work, work, work, work, work has truly paid off.


Beyoncé, “Beyoncé”: See earlier entry.
Adele, “21”: Back in my day — well in 2010 — record labels sent albums months in advance, and in November 2010 I received Adele’s “21.” Everything else around had to be turned off. I was sucked in. Months later, so was the world. THE ENTIRE WORLD. Adele was impressive on her 2008 debut, especially on “Hometown Glory,” but with “21” she went deep, too deep, she was rolling in the deep! Literally. Each song made you feel something — sad, lonely, bouncy, fired up, calm, angry, lost. And nine years later, each song sounds as classic as they did at first listen, especially “Turning Tables,” “Set Fire to the Rain” and the incomparable “Someone Like You.”
Kendrick Lamar, “good kid, m.A.A.d city”: All of Kendrick Lamar’s albums released this decade have been masterpieces, including the 2011 independent release “Section.80” as well as the major-label projects “To Pimp a Butterfly” and “DAMN.,” which won him the Pulitzer Prize for music as he made history as the first non-classical or jazz artist to win the prestigious prize. Lamar has profoundly mixed his poetry with hip-hop, jazz, soul, funk and African music to create songs that tackle blackness, street life, police brutality, survival and self-worth. And with 2012’s “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” this great kid immediately raised the bar not in only in hip-hop, but in music period, forcing his peers to do better and try harder.
HAIM, “Days Are Gone”: The sister trio HAIM reached perfection on their debut album. Hit play. And that is all.
SZA, “Ctrl”: SZA is masterful and introspective on her confessional debut album, which follows a young woman going through life and the turbulent experiences that come with it, from dating dusty boys to dealing with self-doubt.


Janelle Monáe, “The ArchAndroid”: According to contemporary pop folklore, Janelle Monae arrived on the pop landscape from another planet, and boy do we need more artists from that sphere to land here now. On the beautifully theatrical “The ArchAndroid,” she brilliantly paints the picture of an android, Cindi Mayweather, who finds out she is the chosen one and is trying to figure out how to handle her newfound mission. The versatile album has so many highpoints, including the Fela-flavored “Dance or Die,” the playful “Tightrope,” the groovy “Locked Inside” and the addictive “Faster.”
Katy Perry, “Teenage Dream”: I’ll quote the opening line of my 2010 “Teenage Dream” review, which came before the album matched the record Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” set by launching five No.1 hits: “Katy Perry’s new CD is like a magical slot machine: Select any song and you’ll hear a hit.”
Bruno Mars, “24K Magic”: Bruno Mars released three epic albums this decade, but “24K Magic” was a whole mood.
Solange, “A Seat at the Table”: Solange’s art-piece of an album will move you to think, and sing along, at the same time.
Sam Smith, “In the Lonely Hour”: Unrequited love ruled Sam Smith’s debut album, introducing the world to a piercing voice that is brave and honest.
Nas, “Life Is Good”: Nas is still the best rapper alive. Don’t at me.
Taylor Swift, “1989”: After dabbling in it on “Red,” former country singer Taylor Swift hopped, skipped and jumped into the pop music world with “1989,” an adventurous album full of hits, hits and more hits.
Kacey Musgraves, “Golden Hour”: With timeless songs like “Space Cowboy,” “Butterflies,” “Slow Burn” and “Lonely Weekend,” Kacey Musgraves proved to not just be golden, but grand.

76,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/frozen-2-leads-box-office-again-playmobil-flops/,"NEW YORK: “Frozen 2” blanketed multiplexes for the third straight weekend, continuing its reign at No. 1 with $34.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.
The Walt Disney Co animated sequel has already grossed $919.7 million worldwide. It will soon become the sixth Disney release this year to cross $1 billion, a record sure to grow to seven once “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” hits theatres later this month. Early next week, Disney will cross $10 billion at the global box office this year.

But the weekend overall at the box office was yet another disappointing one for the movie industry. A handful of under-performing releases and a relatively thin wide-release schedule hasn’t helped the 5.6% slide in domestic ticket sales from last year, according to data firm Comscore.
This weekend produced an outright flop in “Playmobil: The Movie,” the week’s only new wide release. The STX Films release was never expected to do well, but it bombed so thoroughly that it will rank among the worst-performing wide-releases ever. It grossed $668,000 in 2,337 venues, giving it a per-theatre average of just $286.
A handful of companies combined to produce the $75 million French film, including Wild Bunch and Pathe.
The top five films were almost unchanged from last weekend.
Rian Johnson’s acclaimed, star-studded whodunit “Knives Out” remained in second place with $14.2 million, declining a modest 47% in its second week of release. With $63.5 million cumulatively and $124.1 million worldwide, the Lionsgate release has been one of the season’s bright spots.
So has James Mangold’s “Ford v Ferrari,” which stayed in third place with $6.5 million over its fourth weekend. The racing drama, starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, has sped to a global take of $168 million for Disney, which acquired the film’s original studio, 20th Century Fox, earlier this year. The film cost about $100 million to make.
Melina Matsoukas’ outlaw romance “Queen & Slim” moved up to fourth in its second week with $6.5 million, swapping places with Marielle Heller’s Mister Rogers drama “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” ($5.2 million in its third weekend).
Todd Haynes’ true-story legal drama “Dark Waters,” starring Mark Ruffalo as a defense attorney who takes on the DuPont chemical company, expanded nationwide to 2,011 theatres. The Focus Features release made $4.1 million.
Celine Sciamma’s acclaimed period romance “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” opened at two locations with a very strong $33,552 per-theatre average. Neon will release the French film wider in February.
Some of the weekend’s most widespread movie watching may have been on Netflix, though the streaming service doesn’t disclose viewership tallies or box-office receipts.
After a three-week theatrical run, Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story,” one of the year’s most critically acclaimed films, began streaming Friday. On Friday, Nielsen said Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” last weekend drew an average audience of 13.6 million viewers from Nov. 27 to Dec. 1. Netflix has said Nielsen numbers, which only estimate US viewership, reflect an incomplete picture.
Amazon likewise didn’t release ticket sales for “The Aeronauts,” which opened in 52 theatres over the weekend. Tom Harper’s film, which cost $40 million to make, stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as 19th century balloonists.
A week before it opens in North America, Sony’s “Jumanji: The Next Level” debuted in 18 international countries where it made $52.5 million. The sequel to 2017’s “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” which grossed $962 million worldwide, is expected to lead the box office next weekend.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at US and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

“Frozen 2,” $34.7 million ($90.2 million international).
“Knives Out,” $14.2 million ($18 million international).
“Ford v Ferrari,” $6.5 million ($8.3 million international).
“Queen & Slim,” $6.5 million.
“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” $5.2 million.
“Dark Waters,” $4.1 million.
“21 Bridges,” $2.9 million.
“Playing With Fire,” $2 million.
“Midway,” $1.9 million.
“Joker,” $1 million.

79,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/marriage-story-dominates-gotham-awards-with-4-wins/,"NEW YORK: Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” was the resounding winner at the IFP Gotham Awards, taking four awards including best feature at the annual New York awards-season kickoff.
By the end of the night on Monday, Baumbach, having long ago exhausted his one prepared speech, stood at the podium exhorting cast members Adam Driver and Laura Dern to lend him help. Having already given their own speeches — Driver for best actor, Dern as a tribute honoree — they demurred, content to watch Baumbach squirm again while he improvised a few remarks.

Baumbach turned, ultimately, to his actors — “My special effect, my everything is the cast,” he said — and to Netflix for what he called its “unconditional” support of his film, a portrait of divorce starring Driver and Scarlett Johansson. Earlier, Baumbach thanked Netflix, too, for saving the Manhattan single-screen Paris Theatre, which the streaming company purchased last week.
Praise for Netflix and its chief content creative officer Ted Sarandos, who was also in attendance, was a common refrain throughout the evening. The streaming service, which filled up numerous tables at the banquet at Cipriani’s Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, also celebrated wins for Ava DuVernay’s Central Park Five series “When They See Us,” (DuVernay was additionally singled out for tribute) and the documentary “American Factory.”
The Gothams, now in their 29th year, is the premier New York gala for independent film, a kind of earlier East Coast corollary to Los Angeles’ Independent Film Spirit Awards in February. Put on by the nonprofit Independent Film Project with nominees selected by committees, Gotham winners can diverge from seasonal favourites. Last year, Chloe Zhao’s lyrical Western “The Rider” took the best feature.
But a recent stretch of Gotham winners went on to land best picture at the Academy Awards, including Barry Jenkins’ “Moonlight,” Tom McCarthy’s “Spotlight” and Alejandro Inarritu’s “Birdman.”
And “Marriage Story,” which begins streaming Friday after playing for several weeks in theaters, seems sure to continue a long march through awards season. Acclaim has been heaped on its leads and its ensemble, and it’s been celebrated as a crowning achievement for the 50-year-old Baumbach.
While not a surprise to others, the most shocked winner of the evening was easily Awkwafina, who took the best actress for her performance in Lulu Wang’s family drama “The Farewell.”
“Oh my god. I never won anything. I can’t even win an argument in the Instagram comments,” said Awkwafina.
A handful of movies up for best feature — “Uncut Gems” with Adam Sandler, “Hustlers” with Jennifer Lopez — went home emptyhanded. Trey Edward Schultz’ ambitious family melodrama “Waves,” also up for best feature, scored an award for Taylor Russell as a breakthrough actor.
The Gotham Awards liberally sprinkle in tributes throughout the ceremony. This year’s honorees included Dern, DuVernay, Sam Rockwell, FilmNation chief executive Glen Basner and Jason DaSilva, a filmmaker and disability rights activist. DaSilva’s Emmy-winning documentary “When I Walk” chronicles his own experience with multiple sclerosis.
DuVernay shared her tips for directing, among them: treat actors and crew the same, don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know” and change your socks at lunchtime.
Both Baumbach and Greta Gerwig presented Dern with her award, donning what they called “Laura Dern sweaters” for the occasion. The two filmmakers, aside from living together as a couple with a son, share Dern in their latest movies. In “Marriage Story,” Dern plays a ruthless divorce attorney. In Gerwig’s “Little Women” (an upcoming Sony Pictures release ineligible for the Gothams), she plays Louisa May Alcott’s benevolent matriarch Marmee.
Gerwig and Baumbach swapped their speeches, which resulted in Baumbach declaring that he loved Dern “even more than Leonardo DiCaprio, who I sincerely believed I would someday marry.”
The Gothams reliably serve as pep rallies for independent cinema and those that toil in the ever-threatened lower-budgeted realm of moviemaking. Presenter Natasha Lyonne, whose Netflix series “Russian Doll” was nominated for best breakthrough series in episodes less than 40 minutes, evoked that sense of indie pride with more than a touch of sarcasm.
“If there’s one thing everyone in the room can agree on,” Lyonne said while presenting, “it’s that we can never have enough Batman movies.”

The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame band will play April 23 at Northern Kentucky University’s BB&T Arena, across the Ohio River 7 miles south of the Dec 3, 1979, concert site, where another two dozen people were injured Dec. 3, 1979, amid confusion and lack of preparation for thousands of fans lined up for hours for first-come seats.

The announcement came after WCPO-TV in Cincinnati aired a Tuesday night documentary featuring interviews with lead singer Roger Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend, the remaining original members of the British band that emerged in the 1960s featuring songs of youthful rebellion such as “My Generation” and its “Summertime Blues” cover.
Both have said they’ve been haunted by the tragedy. Townshend recently told The Associated Press he was looking forward to discussing it in Cincinnati.
“Now we can have a conversation about it when we go back,” Townshend said.
“We will meet people and we’ll be there. We’ll be there. That’s what’s important,” he said. “I’m so glad that we’ve got this opportunity to go back.”
The band is adding the concert to its “Moving On!” tour 2020 dates.
The Who said it will donate a portion of proceeds from the Cincinnati area concert to a memorial scholarship fund benefiting students in the Cincinnati suburb of Finneytown. Daltrey visited a Finneytown High School memorial site in 2018 and the band has for years supported the scholarship effort there. Three of the 11 killed, including two 15-year-old girls who were the youngest victims, had attended Finneytown High.
The band didn’t know about the tragedy until the concert was ending. Longtime manager Bill Curbishley had made the decision to have the show go on, warning Cincinnati authorities that they wouldn’t be able to control the crowd if the concert was called off.
“Despite everything, I still feel inadequate,” he told WCPO. “I don’t know about the guys, but for me, I left a little bit of my soul in Cincinnati.”

Hit animated movie takes inspiration from Sámi culture
Sámi people live in northern Europe
“Frozen 2” dubbed in North Sámi, rare move for a blockbuster

OSLO: The sequel to Walt Disney Co’s 2013 hit animated musical “Frozen” is generating excitement among indigenous Sámi people in northern Europe, whose culture the movie has taken inspiration from.
“Frozen 2” debuted in US cinemas on Nov 22 and is progressively rolling out worldwide. On its debut weekend, it grossed $350 million, making it “the biggest opening ever for Walt Disney Animation (not including Pixar)”, according to Hollywood trade publication Variety. The movie opens in Norway on Christmas Day.

Norway inspired many elements of the first “Frozen” movie, such as character Anna’s dress or the architecture of the fictional kingdom of Arendelle.
The second film takes inspiration from the culture of the Sámi, an indigenous minority living across Norway, Sweden, Finland and northern Russia, who have faced discrimination against their language and culture.
In Norway, a state-appointed truth and reconciliation commission is investigating the discrimination perpetrated on minorities including the Sámi and Kven peoples.
“I am planning to see the movie again with my whole family,” said Aili Keskitalo, president of the consultative Sámi Parliament in Norway, who attended the film’s world premiere in Los Angeles with her 11-year-old daughter and set a scene from the movie as her Facebook profile picture.
“Frozen 2” sees Anna and sister Elsa head north of Arendelle to find out the truth about a mystery. They meet the Northuldra, who live closely with the reindeer. Reindeer herding is a traditional Sámi activity.
“Some of the beautiful costumes in the film took inspiration from our gákti. They also took inspiration from the guksi, our traditional wooden cup,” said Anne Lajla Utsi, a member of a Sámi advisory group that collaborated with the filmmakers.
“We felt they really listened and that it was very important to them to do this right,” Utsi, managing director of the International Sámi Film Institute, told Reuters.
Disney signed a contract with Sámi representatives to commit themselves to portray their culture respectfully. That included supporting the dubbing of the movie in North Sámi, the most spoken of the Sámi languages, and release it at the same time as the Norwegian version.
When Utsi posted a picture of the “Frozen 2” poster on Facebook with its Sámi title, “Jikŋon 2”, it went viral.
“My youngest daughter is really looking forward to watching the movie again in her language,” said Keskitalo.
“My elder daughters, who are 22 and 25 years old, are also very excited about seeing the movie. It is not often that we see a movie in North Sámi. I think a lot of adults will see the movie too.” (

82,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/k-pop-singer-sentenced-to-6-years-in-jail-for-rape-sharing-secret-sex-videos/,"SEOUL: A South Korean court sentenced a K-pop musician to six years in prison on Friday for raping a woman and distributing a video capturing the act in a case that drew attention to the darker side of the country’s lucrative entertainment industry.
Jung Joon-young, 30, was arrested in March. Choi Jong-hoon, 30, a former member of South Korean boy band FT Island, was also sentenced to five years in prison for the rape of the woman.
Both were members of online chat groups that shared secret sex tapes and made jokes about drugging and raping women, the Seoul Central District Court said.
Jung’s conviction also includes the illegal distribution of other videos he took secretly while having sex with women. The identities of the victims were suppressed to protect their privacy.
The court also sentenced each man to 80 hours in “sexual violence treatment” education.
“The defendants are well-known celebrities and friends, but the chat they’ve had showed that they simply considered women as objects of sexual pleasure, and committed crimes that were extremely serious,” Judge Kang Seong-soo said as he handed down the verdict.
“Strict punishment is inevitable as the damage inflicted has not properly been recovered and the victims demand harsh penalties.”
Jung admitted distributing the video and others he took, though he argued the sex was in all cases consensual. Choi denied raping the woman, and had argued that he did not remember having sex with her and that if he had, it was likely consensual.
Lawyers for Jung and Choi could not be reached for comment.
Their case was one of several scandals involving sex crimes and other illegal activity that revealed a dark side of an industry at the centre of the global K-pop craze.
Lee Seung-hyun, a former member of K-pop group Big Bang better known by the stage name Seungri, is also on trial over accusations he paid for prostitutes for foreign businessmen to drum up investment in his business.

HONG KONG: Taiwanese-Canadian model-actor Godfrey Gao has died after suffering an apparent heart attack while on set in China.
Gao was filming a sports reality show in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo on Wednesday when he died. His agency, JetStar Entertainment, confirmed his death on its official Facebook page.
The 35-year-old was filming “Chase Me,” a Chinese variety series, when he reportedly fell while running. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to his agency.
The Taiwan-born Gao initially rose to fame by becoming the first Asian male model for the luxury brand Louis Vuitton. He acted in numerous television dramas and movies, including a role in the Hollywood film “The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.”
His body will be transported Wednesday to Taipei, Taiwan’s capital.

84,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/singer-goo-haras-death-shines-light-on-dark-side-of-k-pop/,"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA: The death of South Korean singer and actress Goo Hara, whose body was found at her home in Seoul this week, has again shone a spotlight on pressures that stars, especially females, face in the cutthroat K-pop industry and in deeply conservative South Korean society.
Goo’s death at age 28 came less than two months after the death of Choi Jin-ri, or Sulli, another K-pop star and Goo’s close friend. Experts say both Goo and Choi faced extensive cyberbullying and sexual harassment from the public and media throughout their careers, which took a toll on their mental health.

Police say they are still investigating Goo’s death and found a “pessimistic note” at her home.
Once popular mostly in Asia, K-pop has spread far beyond South Korea, thanks to wildly popular groups such as “BTS” and “Blackpink.”
Goo debuted in 2008 as part of the five-member girl group Kara, which shot almost immediately to fame and helped pioneer the K-pop global phenomenon.
She later launched a successful solo career in South Korea and Japan.
Sulli began her career around the same time as Goo, debuting as a member of the girl band f(x) in 2009. She also had multiple acting roles after stepping away from her singing career.
Goo made headlines when she took her former boyfriend, Choi Jong-bum, to court last year. Choi claimed to have been assaulted by her, while Goo accused him of threatening to release a sex video of her.
During the dispute, Goo’s Korean agency didn’t renew her contract. A court sentenced Choi to 1 ½ years in prison on charges of coercion and assaulting and blackmailing Goo. The jail term was suspended, keeping him out of prison. Choi appealed and the trial is still ongoing.
K-pop is highly competitive, with dozens of groups debuting each year. Industry experts have long warned about the dark side of the scandal-ridden industry. Aspiring artists, as young as their early teens, train for years. Only a few debuts and even fewer are commercially successful. The likelihood of their success increases if they sign with a handful of top entertainment agencies.
The industry is known to have strict rules for their stars — including dating bans, spartan training and diets, and sometimes slave-like and unfair contracts. Experts say the industry has additional requirements for its female artists, unspoken rules reflective of South Korea’s patriarchal society.
Park Hee-A, a K-pop journalist and writer of “Interviews with K-pop Stars,” said female stars are bound by rigid societal rules of femininity.
“Some female idol members have gotten ostracized for not smiling in a television show and reading a book about feminism that contradicts male-dominated patriarchal South Korean society,” Park told The Associated Press.
Expectations of purity and chastity govern women in South Korea. Goo faced a barrage of hate comments following media reports about the sex video despite her being the victim of revenge porn.
“The topic of sex is taboo in South Korea compared to western countries,” said Tae-Sung Yeum, attending psychiatrist at Gwanghwamun Forest Psychiatric Clinic. “There’s a high moral standard required, especially for female celebrities, because South Korea is a patriarchal society.”
Sulli, Goo’s long-time friend, also made headlines, often malicious and misogynistic, for speaking out about subjects such as ageism and feminism. She was criticized for wearing shirts without a bra, calling older male colleagues by their first names and openly supporting feminism.
Yeum said it’s difficult for K-pop stars to seek professional help for depression, especially in a country where many people believe that psychiatric disorders can be “treated with one’s will.” He said multiple suicides in the industry stem from stars being plunged into a hypercompetitive system with a plethora of abuses from a young age.
When Sulli was found dead in her Seongnam home, Goo bid farewell to her friend in a live-streamed video. “I will live more diligently for you,” Goo cried while apologizing for not being able to make it to her funeral.
Two days before Goo’s death, she uploaded a final selfie on her Instagram with the caption, “Good night.”

At the end of a year that saw musicians like Niall Horan and Ed Sheeran gingerly dip their toes into other languages, Coldplay have responded: Hold my European beer.
Their new album, “Everyday Life,” is so utterly embracing of the world that has words spoken or sung in Arabic, Spanish, Zulu and Igbo, and even a French verse sung by lead singer Chris Martin.
This cover image released by Parlophone/Atlantic shows “Everyday Life,” a release by Coldplay. Photo: Parlophone/Atlantic via AP
It’s a fluid and experimental 53-minute double album, divided into two halves, Sunrise and Sunset. If on 2015’s “A Head Full of Dreams,” the band sampled the likes of Barack Obama and a Rumi poem, now they’re doubling down.
“Everyday Life” is bursting with idiosyncratic references, ranging from the film “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” to a Bob Dylan lyric, a novel by Khaled Hosseini, audio of a bullying traffic stop by a cop in Philadelphia, an elegy to Africa, samples from Nigerian composer Harcourt Whyte and jazz legend Alice Coltrane, the South African activist song “Jikelele” and an exuberant tune about Syrian refugees (“Orphans,” which features a credit for Martin’s teenage son, Moses).
“Orphans” is really the only traditional-sounding Coldplay song. The others are often subdued, instrumental or undercooked. “I haven’t finished this one yet” say the liner notes on the stripped-down and fragmentary “WOTW/POTP.” It’s an astonishing, unsafe step from a band who could have just kept giving us “Something Like This.”
There are ambient sounds and snippets from films, including the documentaries “Everything Is Incredible” and “Fela Kuti: Music is the Weapon.” The band even seems to reference themselves (“Boom bo-boom boom” from “X Marks the Spot.”) Sometimes it feels less than an album and more like a multimedia project.
Fans will find that, sonically, the band has stepped off the dance floor. The new music is less bombastic and more intimate. “Old Friends” is a mournful ode to loss, while “Daddy” is sung from the heartbreaking perspective of an abandoned child. “Daddy are you OK?/Look dad we got the same hair.” There’s even spots of gospel and funk-jazz.
The band is also playing with time, with lyrics and credits seemingly created on an old typewriter and offering old timey band portraits that recall those famous shots of The Band.
There are also political songs — the menacing “Trouble in Town” and the sarcastic “Guns” — but most of the album is about faith — all faiths, from East Asian Buddhism to Pakistani Sufism.
It begins with a prayer in “Church” — “Oh, Father, God Almighty, why have you forsaken me?” — and ends 15 songs later with a soft thanksgiving Hallelujah, thanks to the gentle title track’s earnest plea for peace (sounding not unlike something from “Parachutes”)
“How in the world am I going to see/You as my brother not my enemy,” Martin sings. “Got to keep dancing when the lights go out.” In response to an ailing world, Coldplay are opening their arms wide and refusing to stop believing.

87,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/leonard-cohens-posthumous-album-centres-on-poetry/,"Leonard Cohen, “Thanks for the Dance” (Columbia/Legacy Recordings)
Leonard Cohen’s last album, released just weeks before he passed in 2016, was “You Want It Darker,” which had a sense of finality that made it a fine conclusion to his brilliant musical career.
“Thanks for the Dance,” on the other hand, seems to bring down the curtain on Cohen’s parallel universe, the poetry he started to publish long before he began making records.
Illustrating the point, the new nine-track set is more like a Cohen spoken-word performance with very good and empathetic musical backing, most of it composed by his son, Adam.
Understated exceptions are the title track and a few lines here and there, but Cohen doesn’t really sing, not that his resonant voice needs a melody to convey the experience, depth, humour, horror and beauty of his lyrics.
Expanding on recordings made mostly at the same time as the sessions for “You Want It Darker,” Adam Cohen and engineer/mixer Michael Chaves searched out some of the master’s previous collaborators and some new ones to complete the compositions. Among them are Sharon Robinson, Jennifer Warnes, the Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue Choir, Beck, Daniel Lanois, Feist, Javier Mas, Zac Rae, Patrick Leonard and Anjani Thomas.
“Happens to the Heart” opens the album with haunting guitar, laud and piano supporting Cohen’s listing of a life’s worth of experiences, the gentle accompaniment from Andre de Ridder’s stargaze orchestra making the lines even more effective — “I was always working steady/But I never called it art.”
The title track could be a sequel to “Take This Waltz,” a 1980s song with lyrics Cohen adapted from a poem by Federico García Lorca. Here the themes appear to be more personal but just as inspired.
Other highlights include the subtle flamenco airs of “The Night of Santiago,” the dark-as-night and terrifying “Puppets” and closer “Listen to the Hummingbird,” a short but wise and emotional epilogue.
“Thanks for the Dance” is like discovering a box of old letters — or in this case, poems — from a departed loved one. It’s an emotional experience that allows Cohen’s great talents to be appreciated again.

She adds: “I’m scared that I might have to cancel some things, so this is kind just a heads up of like I don’t know what’s happening with my body, and I’m really disappointed and freaked out of why I can’t get better because it’s been over three weeks at this point.”

“Joker,” a dark origin story from Warner Bros about Batman’s arch nemesis, had sold $999.1 billion as of Thursday despite not having been screened in China, which is projected to become the world’s largest movie market next year.
Starring Joaquin Phoenix as a mentally-ill loner who finds fame through a random act of violence, the movie earned warm reviews as it opened in early October but stoked controversy in the United States over fears it would encourage violence.



Box office analyst Gitesh Pandya said “Joker” would top the $1 billion level on Friday.


“Absolutely jaw-dropping achievement for an R-rated film with a moderate budget and no China release,” Pandya, founder and editor of Box Office Guru, wrote on Twitter.
Its nearest R-rated rivals are 2018 movie “Deadpool 2” ($785 million) and 2016’s “Deadpool” ($783 million), both starring Ryan Reynolds as a foul-mouthed superhero.



Thanks to a modest production budget estimated at about $60 million, “Joker” is also the most profitable comic book movie ever, according to Forbes.com, due largely to the film’s focus on character rather than special effects and action scenes.



“Joker” is now the 7th biggest Hollywood movie at the 2019 box office, behind action-packed blockbuster “Avengers: Endgame” at $2.8 billion and family movie “The Lion King” at $1.6 billion, both from Walt Disney.
The movie is expected to land nominations in the upcoming Hollywood awards season and has inspired fans to visit the spot in New York’s Bronx district where Phoenix’s character transforms into the Joker, his face painted like a clown and with green hair, and dances triumphantly down a set of steep steps.

93,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/disney-plus-adds-disclaimer-about-racist-movie-stereotypes/,"NEW YORK: Disney’s new streaming service has added a disclaimer to “Dumbo,” “Peter Pan” and other classics because they depict racist stereotypes, underscoring a challenge media companies face when they resurrect older movies in modern times.
The move comes as Disney Plus seems to be an instant hit. It attracted 10 million subscribers in just one day. The disclaimer reads, “This program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.”
Companies have been grappling for years with how to address stereotypes that were in TV shows and movies decades ago but look jarring today. Streaming brings the problem to the fore.
In “Dumbo,” from 1941, crows that help Dumbo learn to fly are depicted with exaggerated black stereotypical voices. The lead crow’s name is “Jim Crow,” a term that describes a set of laws that legalized segregation. In “Peter Pan,” from 1953, Native American characters are caricatured. Other Disney movies with the disclaimer include “The Jungle Book” and “Swiss Family Robinson.”
“Pocahontas” and “Aladdin” do not have it, despite rumblings by some that those films contain stereotypes, too.
On personal computers, the disclaimer appears as part of the text description of shows and movies underneath the video player. It’s less prominent on a cellphone’s smaller screen. Viewers are instructed to tap on a “details” tab for an “advisory.”
Disney’s disclaimer echoes what other media companies have done in response to problematic videos, but many people are calling on Disney to do more.
The company “needs to follow through in making a more robust statement that this was wrong, and these depictions were wrong,” said Psyche Williams-Forson, chairwoman of American studies at the University of Maryland at College Park. “Yes, we’re at a different time, but we’re also not at a different time.”
She said it is important that the images are shown rather than deleted, because viewers should be encouraged to talk with their children and others about the videos and their part in our cultural history.
Disney’s disclaimer is a good way to begin discussion about the larger issue of racism that is embedded in our cultural history, said Gayle Wald, American studies chairwoman at George Washington University.
“Our cultural patrimony in the end is deeply tethered to our histories of racism, our histories of colonialism and our histories of sexism, so in that sense it helps to open up questions,” she said.
Wald said Disney is “the most culturally iconic and well-known purveyor of this sort of narrative and imagery,” but it’s by no means alone.
Universal Pictures’ teen comedy “Sixteen Candles” has long been decried for stereotyping Asians with its “Long Duk Dong” character.
Warner Bros. faced a similar problem with its “Tom and Jerry” cartoons that are available for streaming. Some of the cartoons now carry a disclaimer as well, but it goes further than Disney’s statement.
Rather than refer to vague “cultural depictions,” the Warner Bros. statement calls its own cartoons out for “ethnic and racial prejudices.”
“While these cartoons do not represent today’s society, they are being presented as they were originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed,” the statement reads.
At times, Disney has disavowed a movie entirely.
“Song of the South,” from 1946, which won an Oscar for the song “Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,” was never released for home video and hasn’t been shown theatrically for decades, due to its racist representation of the plantation worker Uncle Remus and other characters. It isn’t included in Disney Plus, either.
Disney and Warner Bros did not respond to requests for comment.
Sonny Skyhawk, an actor and producer who created the group American Indians in Film and Television, found the two-sentence disclaimer lacking.
What would serve minority groups better than any disclaimer is simply offering them opportunities to tell their own stories on a platform like Disney Plus, Skyhawk said. He said that when he talks to young Indian kids, “the biggest negative is they don’t see themselves represented in America.”

94,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/the-crown-welcomes-its-new-royals-in-season-3-launch/,"LONDON: Television fans welcomed a new queen on Wednesday as Olivia Colman and other stars of royal drama “The Crown” turned out for the world premiere of the Netflix show’s third season.
Colman, who won an Oscar earlier this year for playing a different royal in dark comedy “The Favourite,” portrays Queen Elizabeth in a retelling of the life of Britain’s reigning monarch. Colman replaces Claire Foy, who won a Golden Globe for the role as a younger version of Elizabeth.
The show’s third season, arriving on Netflix on Sunday, picks up the story in the mid-1960s going through to 1977, as heir to the throne Prince Charles (Josh O’Connor) comes of age and Britain goes through a pop culture revolution led by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.

Creator Peter Morgan has said the series, whose first two seasons cost about $130 million to make, is based on known facts and imagined private conversations.



Helena Bonham Carter, who takes on Elizabeth’s younger sister Princess Margaret, said she was a joy to play.



“The hardest thing about playing Margaret or anybody of the family is that ultimately so many people feel they know her. And everyone has an opinion,” Bonham Carter told Reuters Television on the red carpet.
“There were so many really close friends that were all too happy to talk about her and wanted to and really loved her and also wanted to show the side that was less known about her – that she was funny, that she was full of warmth and that she was very multicolored,” the actress said.
Erin Doherty, who plays second-born child Princess Anne, said that working on the series had made her more sympathetic to the royal family.


“After doing this show, I feel like I understand them a lot more and I really, really value them and I have a lot of empathy for them,” Doherty said.


Asked whether he thought the royal family watched the show, Tobias Menzies, who plays the queen’s husband Prince Philip in middle age, said he doubted it.
“It makes me a bit nervous imagining them watching it. I’d be amazed if they watch it, but maybe they do…. My money is that they probably don’t,” he said.

The Grammy-winning singer known for his silky-smooth vocals was revealed as this year’s winner Tuesday night on NBC’s “The Voice.” He serves as a coach on the singing competition series with Gwen Stefani, Kelly Clarkson and Blake Shelton.
Shelton, who was named Sexiest Man Alive in 2017, announced Legend’s honor on “The Voice.” The country singer then handed Legend some short shorts with bedazzled letters “EGOTSMA” to signify the singer’s many honors: an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony and now, Sexiest Man Alive.
Legend tells the magazine in an issue out Friday the honor comes with some pressure after following Idris Elba, who was last year’s winner. He jokes it “is not fair and is not nice to me!”
The 40-year-old Legend is a 10-time Grammy winner. He scored an Oscar in 2015 for co-writing the song “Glory” from the film “Selma.” He won a Tony Award for his co-producer work on “Jitney” and took home an Emmy as a producer on NBC’s live version of “Jesus Christ Superstar,” a project in which he also played the role of Jesus.
Legend has two children with model-television host-cookbook author Chrissy Teigen.
Other recent winners include Dwayne Johnson, Chris Hemsworth, Adam Levine, Channing Tatum and David Beckham.
“I want to thank Blake Shelton,” Legend said. “I observed every move he made, every utterance that came from his mouth and I think some of it rubbed off on me.”
Legend said his wife is proud of him.
“I’ve finally impressed her,” he said.

96,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/war-epic-midway-bests-doctor-sleep-at-the-box-office/,"LOS ANGELES: Despite a fresh injection of four big movies into the marketplace including a Stephen King adaptation, a World War II epic, a glossy, holiday-themed romantic comedy and a family-friendly comedy, audiences largely stayed away from theatres this weekend and the North American box office is hurting.
Down nearly 27% from last year, the sluggish weekend allowed for a few big surprises, however. The biggest surprise was the fact that the Roland Emmerich film “Midway,” which slightly overperformed, snagged the first-place spot over Warner Bros.’ “Doctor Sleep,” a film that came in well under expectations and has left many in the business scratching their heads as to why.

Lionsgate on Sunday estimated that “Midway” earned $17.5 million from 3,242 screens. The studio acquired the film about the Battle of Midway that features a large ensemble cast including Nick Jonas and Patrick Wilson.
“As expected, everyone is ecstatic,” said David Spitz, Lionsgate’s president of domestic distribution.
“Midway” cost a reported $100 million to produce and the studio is projecting that the film will have grossed $20.1 million by the end of Veteran’s Day Monday.
Reviews didn’t seem to play into account with the box office at all this weekend. Critics were not kind to “Midway” (it’s currently at 40% on Rotten Tomatoes), but audiences, who were largely male (60 and older (87% were over 25) had given the film an A CinemaScore.
And although $17.5 million is not a massive number on its own, it was a significant upset since going into the weekend experts thought the No. 1 spot would easily go to Warner Bros.’ “Doctor Sleep,” the high-profile Stephen King adaptation starring Ewan McGregor. But audiences slept on the well-reviewed (73% on Rotten Tomatoes) sequel to King’s “The Shining” and it grossed only $14.1 million from over 3,800 locations. The film from director Mike Flanagan even utilized the classic imagery of Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film version of “The Shining,” which factored heavily into the marketing.
Budgeted at around $50 million, “Doctor Sleep” was expected to open to over $25 million. The studio was disappointed with the result. But it’s at least partially attributable to the “general malaise” at the box office this weekend.
“There’s no way to sugarcoat this, this was a pretty awful weekend for the overall marketplace,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for the box office tracker Comscore.
In a more minor surprise, Paramount Pictures’ John Cena-led “Playing With Fire,” a family-friendly comedy about firefighters, opened in third place with $12.8 million over Universal Pictures’ Wham!-inspired romantic comedy “Last Christmas.” Starring Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, “Last Christmas” took fourth place with $11.6 million. But Universal is optimistic about its prospects, considering the thematic nature of the film and the holiday weekends to come.
“We have a fantastic storyteller in Paul Feig and a ridiculously charming cast,” said Universal’s distribution head Jim Orr.
Once again, the bright spots at the box office are in the awards-friendly limited releases. Amazon opened Shia LaBeouf’s autobiographical film “Honey Boy” in four locations, where it earned a strong $288,824. And Lauren Greenfield’s Imelda Marcos documentary “The Kingmaker” opened in two locations to $23,600. Both “Parasite,” which earned $2.6 million from 603 locations, and “Jojo Rabbit,” which added $3.9 million from 802 locations, also continue to perform well as the films expand a little bit each week.
But it’s still one of the worst early November weekends in years and Dergarabedian noted that the smaller films are not going to move the needle on the overall box office for the year, which remains down 5.5%.
“It’s definitely a little bit of a challenged box office,” Orr said.
Although The Walt Disney Co.’s “Frozen 2” is on the horizon to help pick things up, Dergarabedian said that at this point, 2019 might not best the record 2018 box office year.
“I think it’d be really tough at this point (to surpass 2018). But it’s not a ‘Chicken Little’ situation,” Dergarabedian said. “When we compare to any other year it’s a solid year.”
Still, he added, “For November, this is a very slow weekend.”

NEW YORK: Woody Allen has ended his $68 million lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc for backing out of a four-picture production and distribution agreement and refusing to distribute a film he had finished.
Allen and Amazon notified the federal court in Manhattan late on Friday night that the lawsuit was being voluntarily dismissed.
Lawyers for Allen and Amazon did not immediately respond on Saturday to requests for comment.
Allen had sued two Amazon units in February, claiming they could not abandon their distribution plans, including for his completed “A Rainy Day in New York,” because of a “baseless” allegation that he had molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992.
Amazon countered in court papers that Allen’s comments related to the #MeToo movement, which began in late 2017, ensured that the company could never receive the expected benefits from its contract with Allen, justifying its decision to end their relationship.
The filmmaker has long denied the allegation by Dylan Farrow, which was also made by her mother Mia Farrow, who appeared in a dozen Allen films and was his longtime partner. He has not been charged.
Allen has won four Oscars, including best director for 1977’s “Annie Hall,” which also won the best picture.
But he has seen modest commercial returns for many films since breaking up with Mia Farrow, and some actors and actresses have expressed regret for appearing in his films after Dylan Farrow’s allegation gained renewed attention.
“Rainy Day” has been released outside the United States but not domestically.

NEW YORK: Stocks ended slightly higher on Friday, helped by better-than-expected quarterly results from Google’s parent Alphabet and retailer Amazon and a modest recovery in oil prices.
However, the gains were held back by disappointing results from Exxon Mobil as well as news out of the Bank of Japan, which did not announce as much stimulus as many had hoped.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 24.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,432.24.
The Dow was held back partly by a drop in the oil giant Exxon Mobil. The company reported its smallest quarterly profit in 17 years, well below what analysts were looking for, due to the continuing weakness in oil prices. Its major competitor, Chevron, fared slightly better. While earnings dropped sharply from a year ago, Chevron’s results still beat analysts’ expectations.
Exxon fell $1.25, or 1.4 percent, to $88.95. Chevron climbed 69 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $102.48 after being down earlier in the day.
Broader market indicators ended higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,173.60 and the Nasdaq composite increased 7.15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,162.13.
Wall Street is finishing out its busiest week of corporate earnings, which was dominated by mostly strong results from technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and others.
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped $25.50, or 3.3 percent, to $791.34. The company reported earnings of $8.42 a share, well above the $8.04 that analysts were looking for.
Amazon rose $6.20, or 1 percent, to $758.81. The online retail giant reported a profit of $1.78 per share, well above the $1.11 a share that analysts expected. Amazon reported it sold $30.4 billion in goods in the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier.
The strong results from Amazon and Google, as well as the results from other tech companies, helped lift the technology-heavy Nasdaq 1.2 percent this week, while the Dow lost 0.8 percent. The S&P 500 closed the week down slightly. It was the first weekly loss for the S&P 500 after four weeks of gains.
So far, corporate profits appear to be coming well ahead of what were very low expectations. Earnings in the S&P 500 so far are down 2.4 percent from a year ago, which is better than the 5.2 percent decline expected when earnings season started, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“Expectations were exceptionally low for the second quarter. While consumers goods and technology has been better than expected, the energy sector continues to show challenges,” said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock.
Investors remain cautious, however. The run-up earlier this month made stocks more expensive than investors are historically comfortable with. The S&P 500 is trading at 18.5 times its expected earnings for the next year, noticeable above the 12-14 times investors typically look for.
The presidential election will continue to grow as an issue for markets in the next several months. Investors dislike uncertainty, and the unexpectedly close presidential election and mostly unknown policies of Donald Trump puts them on edge.
Next week another fifth of the S&P 500 will report their results, including Proctor & Gamble, General Motors, Kraft Heinz, 21st Century Fox and Allstate, among many others.
Moore also pointed out the July jobs report, released August 5, will give investors direction since the June and May jobs reports showed two clashing directions for the US economy.
Japan’s central bank ended a policy meeting Friday by announcing it will expand purchases of exchange traded funds from financial institutions to help inject more cash into the world’s third-largest economy and pursue its 2 percent inflation target. But the measures fell short of hopes for more aggressive action. That helped the yen surge as investors priced in fewer yen in circulation. The dollar dropped to 102.03 yen from 105.45 yen.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury note falling to 1.46 percent from 1.51 percent the day before.
In energy trading, benchmark US crude reversed earlier losses and was up 46 cents to close at $41.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 24 cents to $42.46 a barrel in London.
Heating oil rose less than 1 cent to $1.28 a gallon, wholesale gasoline futures rose 1 cent to $1.32 a gallon and natural gas fell was little changed at $2.88 per thousand cubic feet.
In other currencies, the euro rose to $1.1179 from $1.1073 the day before and the British pound rose to $1.3239 from $1.3148.
The price of gold closed up $16.70 to $1,349 an ounce, silver rose 16 cents to $20.31 an ounce and copper rose a penny to $2.222 a pound.

NEW YORK: Five years after United Airlines and Continental merged, the company’s new CEO declared in a public letter that the combined company has failed to live up to the expectations of both fliers and United’s employees.
Just three weeks into the job, CEO Oscar Munoz acknowledged in full-page newspaper ads that “the journey hasn’t always been smooth.”
Since the merger, United has been plagued with chronic delays, computer outages and dissatisfied workers, who have a reputation for taking out their frustrations on fliers. The problems overshadowed the tenure of former CEO Jeff Smisek, who took over the combined airline when the merger closed on Oct. 1, 2009.
On Sept. 8, Chicago-based United Continental Holdings said Smisek was ousted following an internal investigation into the airline’s dealing with the public agency that operates its hub airport in Newark, New Jersey. That agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is part of a federal investigation into abuse of power. Munoz, a railroad executive and head of United’s audit committee, was named president and CEO.
In his letter, which ran in national newspapers, Munoz didn’t offer any hints as to how he will actually fix United’s many problems except that he will listen to fliers and employees.
“We are committed to re-earning your trust,” he wrote.
The company set up a website, UnitedAirtime.com, for people to ask questions and provide feedback to the airline. The airline posted a few questions and answers in advance of the site’s launch that focus on delayed luggage delivery, aging airplanes that lack Wi-Fi or working TVs and the poor quality of first-class meals.
“Let’s be honest, the implementation of the United and Continental merger has been rocky for customers and employees,” Munoz says on a video greeting on the site. “While it’s been improving recently, we still haven’t lived up to our promise or our potential.”

WASHINGTON: US manufacturers expanded at their slowest pace in two years last month, held back by faltering global growth and cutbacks in oil and gas drilling.
The Institute for Supply Management says its index of factory activity fell sharply to 50.2 in September from 51.1 in August. That is the lowest level since May 2013. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders and production both fell sharply and a measure of hiring also declined, according to the ISM, a trade group of purchasing managers. All three still barely remained in expansion territory.
US manufacturers are getting hit by slower growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy, and a stronger dollar, which makes US goods more expensive overseas. Oil and gas drillers are also cutting back on their orders for steel pipe and other goods in the wake of sharply lower oil prices.
China’s factory activity contracted last month, according to a survey of its purchasing managers, though its manufacturing index inched up to 49.8 from 49.7 in August.
Manufacturers cut 15,000 jobs last month, the most in five years, payroll services provider ADP said Wednesday. The government will release its jobs report Friday, and economists forecast it will show that the economy added 206,000 jobs overall.
The unemployment rate is expected to remain at a seven-year low of 5.1 percent.
Most economists expect US manufacturing will do little for the economy for the rest of the year, with the possible exception of automakers. But so far, healthy consumer spending on cars, homes and restaurant meals is offsetting overseas weakness and driving modest growth.

Are we utilising resources to the best of our ability?
As Shahrukh Khan stated in the blockbuster film, ‘Chennai Express’ — “Don’t underestimate the power of a common man”, the financial markets can deliver the same phrase with a twist. Don’t underestimate the power of information! In the age of technology and information, the world of traders has been enveloped by numerous data and reports. Life, as the traders know it, has been surrounded by scores of data emancipating from various economies and every second matters in the race towards accomplishing profits. With the passage of time, global markets have provided innovative ways to look at the markets and the fundamentals within it. Given that global markets are operating 24 hours a day and five days a week, inevitably investors will enhance their knowledge levels.
In recent times, during market operation, information does stem out from every corner of the globe with astounding pace that traders need to keep an eye on every major economy around the globe. Given the markets is a convergent point for the constant flow of information, investors should weigh the data and incorporate the ones which one feels will be imperative to his trading strategies. Easier said than done, the preceding sentence might leave some readers with a raised eyebrow and an immediate question — how do I weigh the information or how can I know the importance of such information?
In the first few trades, it is important to follow the impact of such information and wait to enact on the appropriate trade. With experience, the trader will learn the importance of such information and incorporate similar strategies in the ensuing days too.
But given the importance of the word ‘information’, are we utilising resources to the best of our abilities? Having undertaken numerous training classes related to the markets, I have noticed that participants have not been keeping themselves updated with the latest developments from around the globe. It is next to impossible to throw the dart expecting to find the bull’s eye when darkness has clouded the room. However, with light, the task of finding the bull’s eye becomes a tad easier. Information is the light, guiding traders and making the process of trading more effective.
A mentor once said — “information from the markets, if interpreted and processed in the right manner, will always reap greater results in the forthcoming days.” In contemporary times, processing the given information is a major challenge for the prevailing investors. In theory, trading seems easier but when theory has to be converted into practice, life does not seem to be easy. However, with experience and practice, one will surely master the art of trading from the given processed information. Hence, information is the most important commodity in today’s global financial world.

FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

When EmpowHER came around, she knew what she needed to do. The idea of sharing the same platform with other like-minded women and learning new things excited her. She joined EmpowHER with a hope to improve her leadership skills, and bring back her experience and understandings to her students.
She has been working as a teacher since the last three years at a women’s school in her neighbourhood. Many of her students work as domestic helpers in dif ferent houses in the community. In exchange for school fees, many young women from rural Nepal travel to the capital to work as domestic helpers. Despite mistreatment and abuse, these girls stay with their host families so that they can receive free schooling. But most of them do not even get to go to school, and even if they do they cannot concentrate and lag behind in their classes due to over workload. Therefore, through her EmpowHER ‘Impact Service Project’ Martina will provide free coaching classes to help these girls with their assignments and class works including sessions on ESL, mathematics, and computer courses. Based on their performance in the coaching classes, she will provide
scholarships to few students to support their tuition fees. She hopes her effort will
help at least few young women to pursue education without being forced into domestic labour.
For her, EmpowHER has exceeded her expectation. It has offered more than she had anticipated, helping her gain more clarity about her goals and herself.

given their basic rights without hesitance.
Through her ‘Impact Service Project’, she wants to create awareness about “Chaupadi”, an old tradition that banishes women during their menstruation forcing them to live in a sheds or outbuildings. They have limited food, poor sanitation, and are vulnerable to wild animal attacks and sexual harassments. Despite being
outlawed in 2005, many families in Western Nepal still practice this detrimental and life threatening tradition. She wants to pilot her project in Mashfal VDC in Dolpa, where many women have lost their lives to Chaupadi. With the help of her project, she will be providing awareness trainings in the community to help women overcome the social pressure to practice such traditions, and establish an understanding of menstruation as a biological process rather than a regressive social practice. She will also provide trainings on women health and how women can take care of themselves while they are menstruating. She hopes that her efforts will help the community gain a different perspective on women menstruation, leading to both behavioral and social change towards such practices.
She joined EmpowHER to empower herself so that she can enable other women in the community. Through EmpowHER she has been able to strengthen her interpersonal skills, better herself as a leader, and develop ever lasting sisterhood.
As the journey of EmpowHER progresses, we see the passion, focus, and the sense of responsibility towards the community brewing strongly in our participants. We are confident that these change makers will leave no stones unturned to make a powerful impact anywhere they go.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

105,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

106,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

107,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/trade-with-confidence/,"IT IS SEEN THAT TRADERS FOCUS ON RESULTS RATHER THAN PROCESS

KATHMANDU: Trade outcomes cannot be assured. The market might be predicted up to some level but its result is uncertain. You entered a market with full preparation to come out successful and it happened to be same as predicted but it can be the other way too; you entered a market with full study and analysis and relied on probabilities to come out successful but it had an unexpected outcome. The nature of trading is like that. Due to its nature and effect on the psyche of human being, it is essential to have a lot of self-confidence.
Self-confidence is an element which is required in every field to excel. Without this underlying competence, a person cannot grow and be ahead. It is rightly said that ‘Without confidence, we can do little in life. With it, we can change the world’. Confidence is a tool which when used in trading can have a positive impact and help to improve the performance thereon. Self-confidence in trading is the ability to focus on improvement and better performance thereby keeping self away from negative thought patterns like fear, greed, anxiety, et cetera.

Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade

Many traders have the misconception that winning trades develop confidence but the fact is just the opposite. More winning trades come from a dedicated focus on the process of trading where traders develop their skills and in doing so, develop their confidence. Focus on the process of trading is very important but very often, it is seen that traders focus on results rather than process. Soon if a trader sees a loss or two in a strategy they attempted, they will discard the strategy. This attitude leads only to frustration. So, in the phase of trading it is quite important to understand how we learn. Learning does not start at point A and steadily progress to point B; it is not a linear. Learning occurs in a series of ups and downs. We grow a little, fall back a bit, advance some more, take breaks and this is how it goes.
Other thing which leads to confidence development is positive thoughts. Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade. They don’t have a negative outlook. Rather they are quite optimistic and try to learn from their mistakes. It is said that positive outlook brings out positive result and the same applies to trading too. So instead of burdenning your mind with negative thoughts and wasting your time, be positive and think of how you can plan your trade better and follow it properly.
Develop self-confidence and you will see a better performance in your trade!

108,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/entrepreneur-juggler/,"“START SMALL, REALLY SMALL. TEST YOUR BUSINESS MODEL BEFORE YOU REACH OUT TO THE MASS.”

KATHMANDU: Amun Thapa, 27, owner/co-owner of five companies combined suggests that he is an ‘entrepreneur juggler’. When asked what it means, he states, “Someone who is constantly juggling between several ventures. At present, I manage Sasto Deal, Sasto Book, Irish Pub, Chhahari Production and Anthropose. A few other interesting projects are in the pipeline.”
Before asking him how he manages to look after all of these, I was curious to know where he started. Amun, I discovered, sees things in black and white without much grey areas. “For any problem, there are two approaches — to complain or to seek for solutions. I have always taken the latter approach. I never intended to become an entrepreneur. But the problems I personally faced in Nepal and elsewhere got me to come up with solutions, and hence the businesses I am involved with,” he shares. He says that getting where he is today was not an easy task. In his own words, “The first and foremost hurdle, when starting a business, is to understand the local legal and tax systems. Nepali entrepreneurs still do not have a clear understanding of how they should go about when it comes to taxation. It is a shame but also a reality that most businesses operate without proper registration and billings. This makes it difficult for other businesses to work. Also, finding the right employees is another major challenge here, apart from building culture.”
Amun shares that getting investment for a start-up in Nepal was a daunting task. He blames the regulations set by the Central Bank for Foreign Direct Investment and suggests that the easiest route is to seek for investment among friends and family. With profit margins depending on the venture/start-up, Amun says that the first year of the start-up, he did not care much about the profit margin but diverted their efforts in generating brand awareness. He shares, “This is when the advertisement costs are at their maximum. But to put it in numbers, a venture must seek at least 10 per cent to 40 per cent profit margin for it to be sustainable and scalable.”
On employees he says, “The smartest thing to do is ignore the resume because it tells nothing about an employee. We hire them on the basis of their performance during their internship period (which usually lasts for two months). Most of them come through referrals. We also have performance incentives to encourage employees to work at their level best. As for salaries, I believe everyone deserves to be paid well, like the saying goes — if you look after your employees, they will look after your clients.” He opines that he would definitely focus more on technology if he had the chance to start over again. “Over the past four years I have witnessed consumers adapting to changes in technology. People have taken to Facebook and Viber for communication, apps are replacing websites, and such. I was talking to a hotel owner in Pokhara yesterday and he told me, one of the first things people ask for after checking-in is the WiFi password.”
When asked about the Nepal’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, Amun says diversification is the key. “Nepal is now not only relying on tourism and hydropower and banking industries as income generating businesses but there are a lot more new industries that were introduced to the market in the past several years. Therefore, we are definitely on the right track.” His words of wisdom for the ones starting out are, “Start small, really small.
Test your business model before you reach out to the mass. Focus on building systems because this comes in handy when you are scaling your businesses. And always give priority to your brand because revenues can go up and down but your brand is what keeps you going.”

Altice expands in US with USD 17.7 billion Cablevision deal
European telecoms group Altice will become a major force in the lucrative US cable market after it agreed to buy fourth-largest operator Cable vision for a mix of cash and shares in a deal worth USD 17.7 billion including debt.
The move is the latest foray by French-Israeli billionaire and Altice founder Patrick Drahi, who built a telecoms and cable empire in recent years via debt-fueled acquisitions in France, Portugal and Israel.Drahi entered the United States in May by buying small regional cable group Suddenlink for USD 9.1 billion and had declared he would do more acquisitions so as eventually to earn half of Altice’s revenue there.
GM to pay USD 900 million settles US criminal case
General Motors Co (GM.N) has agreed to pay USD 900 million and sign a deferred-prosecution agreement to end a US government investigation into its handling of an ignition-switch defect linked to 124 deaths, two sources told Reuters. The deal means GM will be charged criminally with hiding the defect from regulators and in the process defrauding consumers, but the case will be put on hold while GM fulfills terms of the deal, one source said. No individuals would be charged in the criminal case, one of the sources said. The company’s expected USD 900 million payment, confirmed by a second source, is less than the USD 1.2 billion that Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) paid to resolve a similar case.

Global stocks at three-week highs as Fed decision looms
World stocks inched to a three-week high on Thursday while the dollar drifted lower against other currencies, as investors consolidated positions ahead of a nail-biting US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. There was a sense of relief as much as anything that after months of market speculation and advice from almost everyone from the IMF to the heads of the world’s top companies, that the wait for the Fed’s verdict would be over by 1800 GMT. Europe’s main share markets were left at a virtual standstill with Britain’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 all barely budged after two days of gains helped by a flurry of merger activity.Currency and bond market moves were low key too.

AUSTRALIA

US Fed may not hike interest rates
The Australian share market has surged ahead of highly anticipated US Federal Reserve rates call, as energy stocks soar on a strong bounce in crude oil prices. Investors remain upbeat approaching the US Federal Reserve’s decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, with financial markets predicting a 30 per cent chance of lift-off. At the 4.15pm (AEST) official market close, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 added 47.9 points, or 0.94 per cent, to 5146.8 points, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 47.6 points, or 0.93 per cent, to 5171.2 points. The growing sense that the US Fed may not hike interest rates has also pushed the Australian dollar above US72c for the first time in three weeks as per The Australian.
Australian shares rose 1.5 per cent on Thursday for a second straight day of gains as all sectors rallied ahead of the US Fed’s interest rate decision later in the day. Banks and miners were among the clear winners with the “Big Four” lenders rising more than two percent in early trade. A jump in oil prices pushed energy stocks higher. The S&P/ASX 200 index added 73.83 points to 5,172.7 by 0215 GMT. The index closed 1.6 per cent higher on Wednesday, and is on track to post a second straight weekly gain. Analysts said the market could claw back some of the day’s gain as the near-month futures contract expires on Thursday and could add some volatility. Asian stocks hit a three-week high on Thursday after a jump in oil prices lifted Wall Street, with many investors taking last-minute positions ahead of the Fed’s policy decision.

BANGLADESH

Secretary of state for treasury ministry
According to The Daily Star, Poland is interested in investing in mining, coal extraction and installation of liquefied natural gas terminal in Bangladesh as the European country has experience in the sectors, a deputy minister said yesterday. Zdzislaw Gawlik, secretary of state for the treasury ministry, also said his country is keen to explore shell gas in Bangladesh. “We are bringing in very solid proposals of investment in Bangladesh,” he said. “I know Bangladesh is developing at a faster rate. So we are working at the government-to-government and business-to-business levels to intensify bilateral relationship.”
Tea prices in Bangladesh edged higher for a second straight week at the weekly auction on Tuesday amid tight supplies and strong demand for quality leaf. Bangladeshi tea fetched an average 187.93 taka (USD 2.4) per kg at the 19th auction of the current marketing season, slightly up from 185.81 taka at the previous week’s sale when the prices snapped seven-week losing streak, an executive with National Brokers said. There was huge demand for quality tea, while volume dropped again this week compared with last week, helping prices to perk up, the executive said. About 1.93 million kg was offered at the sole auction centre in Chittagong, of which 6.5 per cent was unsold. In the previous auction, about 10 per cent of the 2.17 million kg offered went unsold. The national budget for the 2015/16 fiscal year that started in July raised the regulatory duty on tea imports by five per cent to discourage overseas buying. Tea prices fell sharply in the last marketing season on poor demand from local buyers as business sentiment was hit by renewed political unrest early this year that left more than 120 people dead and disrupted supplies. The country, however, has moved from being a net exporter to a net importer of tea due to rising consumption.

CHINA

Activists rally ouside the White House
China’s economic powerhouse is slowing, destabilising global markets. Beijing’s neighbors, unnerved over its pursuit of territorial claims, are increasingly cosying up to Washington. A threat of US cyber sanctions looms over Chinese companies. It might seem an ideal time for US President Barack Obama to take advantage of Beijing’s troubles and get tough when he hosts Chinese leader Xi Jinping for a state visit on September 25. Obama is expected to press Xi on issues that have strained relations between the two countries, but his approach will be tempered because for better or worse the world’s two biggest economies are inextricably bound together. That will mean a difficult balancing act for Obama. He is under pressure to send a strong message to Xi over cyber spying, Chinese economic policies and South China Sea disputes, but he does not want to upend a summit that could set the tone for relations for his last 16 months in office.
Just as China shows that its domestic stock market can be something of a one-way street — investors can put money in, but not take money out — the biggest mutual fund company, Vanguard Group, is moving ahead with plans to expose more mom-and-pop investors to the country’s heavily restricted exchanges. With the Shanghai stock exchange down by 37 per cent and the Shenzhen exchange off by 43 per cent during the past three months, compared with just an 18 per cent drop on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, Vanguard is adding China mainland stocks to its USD 60 billion emerging markets fund in the coming year.Vanguard says adding A-shares — stocks that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, as opposed to those that trade on the Hong Kong exchange — will diversify the fund, but acknowledges they pose unique risks related to tracking a benchmark. Steps taken by the Chinese government to restrict trading on domestic exchanges make it difficult for index funds to buy the stocks they need to replicate the performance of Chinese benchmarks, fund executives said.

EUROPE

Nestle fails to convince European judges
According to The Guardian, Nestlé has failed in an attempt to convince European judges to let it trademark the shape of the four-finger version of a KitKat in the UK. The European court of justice ruled that the KitKat’s shape was not distinctive enough for consumers to associate it with the chocolate covered wafer. Nestlé is not seeking to trademark its two-fingered version of KitKat. Nestlé had argued that even without its red and white packaging or the word KitKat embossed on the chocolate, the shape of the bar should be regarded as distinct. The dispute between Nestlé and Cadbury, which has fought to prevent Nestlé securing a trademark, will go back to the UK high court for a final ruling that will determine whether rivals will be able to launch copycat KitKats in Britain.Despite the court’s failure to allow the trademark, Nestlé said it was pleased with the ruling.

No implementation review is possible before Greece’s September 20 parliamentary elections. “There are elections in Greece. We have to wait for the results,” Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna, whose country holds the EU’s rotating presidency, told Reuters in an interview.

INDIA

Reserve Bank of India headquaters, Mumbai
India requires sustained low inflation and a credible programme for fiscal rectitude to lower the cost of capital, Urjit Patel, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said on Thursday, striking a hawkish note after government calls for interest rate cuts to boost the economy. The central banker also said in a speech to a business conference that he expected India’s current account deficit to be 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product in the 2015/16 fiscal year. New banking licences issued by the RBI were also aimed at lowering the cost of capital, Patel said. His remarks addressed concerns that commercial banks have failed to pass on recent cuts in the RBI’s main policy rate to their borrowers.
India plans to address some pending tax disputes in the next few days, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday, but did not give details or say whether the cases in question included disputes with foreign companies that have spooked investors. Earlier this month, the finance ministry decided not to press claims for a Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) against foreign portfolio investors. India remains locked in major back-tax battles with telecoms group Vodafone (VOD.L) and Cairn Energy (CNE.L). Arun Jaitley said last week that the government was trying to resolve pending tax cases, many of them outside the courts.

JAPAN

Workers are seen in a container area at a port
Japan’s exports slowed for a second straight month in August in a worrying sign that China’s economic slowdown could deal a damaging blow to the world’s third-biggest economy and force policymakers to inject fresh stimulus before too long. The data joins a string of depressing shipment numbers in key regional economies — including South Korea and Taiwan — which has heightened anxiety over a China-led slowdown in global growth and tempered bets of the US Federal Reserve lifting rates for the first time in almost a decade later on Thursday.Slowing exports could increase the chance of additional monetary easing from the Bank of Japan, because this could lead to lower factory output, slack economic activity and less momentum needed to offset deflationary pressure caused by a collapse in oil prices.
Vietnam agreed with Japan on Tuesday to step up security cooperation, becoming the latest Southeast Asian country to seek closer ties with Tokyo as China maintains an assertive posture in disputed waters in the South China Sea. The agreement between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Vietnam’s Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong comes after a US expert said on Monday China appeared to be carrying out preparatory work for a third airstrip in contested territory in the South China Sea. China has overlapping claims with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei in the South China Sea. It is also embroiled in a row with Japan over a group of East China Sea islets. Earlier this year, Japan reached an agreement with Malaysia and the Philippines to strengthen security ties.

Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Thursday ahead of a likely policy move by the US Federal Reserve, with stocks in Malaysia outperforming and Singapore hitting a more than one-week high as a big jump in global oil prices boosted energy stocks. Oil prices jumped as much as six per cent on Wednesday after a US stock draw. Oil bulls were also encouraged by doubts on whether the Fed will decide to hike US interest rates on Thursday after tame August inflation data. Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur composite index was up 2.1 per cent on a rally in oil-related stocks. The index touched 1,691.93, a near six-week high, on resuming trade after a market holiday. Shares of oil and gas services firm Sapurakencana Petroleum Bhd was up seven per cent and Tenaga Nasional Bhd was 2.3 per cent higher, among top gainers.
While Malaysia’s premier faces tough questions over the origin of hundreds of millions of dollars transferred to his bank accounts, the country has tentatively received good grades for its anti-money laundering efforts from a team of international experts, documents reviewed by Reuters show. A draft report by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body which monitors how countries fight illicit financial flows, said Malaysia had put in place a “robust policy framework” to combat money laundering.But it said the Asian country needed to be more effective in targeting high-risk offences and needs to pay more attention to transnational crime. The draft, dated Aug 4 and marked for official use, said the FATF inspection team found the Malaysian government had a “strong political commitment and well functioning coordination structures” to fight money laundering and that “significant resources have been allocated” to investigations in this field.

RUSSIA

Launch of new Opel Astra to boost sales
General Motors (GM.N) executives said they remained committed to meeting their goal of reaching profitability in Europe by 2016, brushing aside concerns that a downturn in Russia could put their goal at risk. “We are confident about reaching our goal,” Opel Chief Executive Karl-Thomas Neumann told journalists at the Frankfurt auto show on Tuesday. In July, GM warned its European employees the Opel and Vauxhall brands were still posting significant losses, and meeting its goal of returning to profit by next year would be difficult given the crisis in Russia and the Euro Zone. But General Motors President Dan Ammann said on Tuesday the launch of a new Opel Astra would help boost sales.
Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc on Tuesday said it expected to complete its new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a soon-to-be banned Russian engine, but the date could slip if it does not receive enough US government funding. Aerojet Vice President Julie Van Kleeck declined comment on reports that Aerojet has offered USD two billion to acquire United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 rocket launch venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Analysts say the bid is a strategic move by Aerojet to shut out rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, that is developing a new engine favored by ULA for use in its new Vulcan rocket. ULA has said Blue Origin’s engine programme is about two years ahead of Aerojet’s work on the AR-1 engine, a claim Aerojet disputes.Work on the new engines gained urgency after US lawmakers passed a ban on use of Russian RD-180 engines for launches of US military or spy satellites following Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine last year.

PAKISTAN

Pakistan and Afghanistan have shelved a raft of agreements that promised to more than triple cross-border trade, officials said, as economic ties seen as key to regional stability fall victim to rivalry and suspicion. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani struck the trade deals with Pakistan soon after taking office last year as part of a broader rapprochement that included plans to share intelligence on Taliban insurgents active in both countries. That cooperation was aimed at tackling the Islamist militant movement, which has separate Afghan and Pakistani branches whose violent campaigns kill thousands of people each year and hamper much-needed development. The trade deals were supposed to be a step towards warmer relations and boosting Afghanistan-Pakistan trade from USD 1.6 billion now to USD five billion by 2017. But officials told Reuters that the agreements, which include reducing tariffs and granting each other preferential trade status, have stalled.
Pakistani farmers will receive USD 3.2 billion in grants, subsidies and loan advances from the government, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced on Tuesday, in a bid to spur sluggish growth in one of the country’s main economic sectors. The new schemes represent the government’s largest economic development programme for the agricultural sector since it was voted into office in 2013.The funds will be provided through immediate cash grants and subsidies on agricultural inputs worth USD 1.4 billion, while loan advances worth USD 1.85 billion will also be made and disbursements begin this year, he said. “The conditions of the agricultural sector do not inspire confidence,” Sharif said as he announced the new package at a farmers’ convention in Islamabad. The package includes immediate cash grants for rice and cotton farmers, cuts in fertiliser prices, and a government scheme to pay insurance premiums for farmers who cannot afford them.

THAILAND

TAC plan expansion of it 4G mobile network
Thailand’s Total Access Communication Pcl (TAC) said on Thursday it is planning a major expansion of its fourth generation (4G) mobile network, as it seeks to displace rivals Advanced Info Service Pcl and True Corp. The country’s second largest mobile operator, controlled by Norway’s Telenor, has received regulatory approval to provide 4G services on the 1800MHz frequency band, which is currently used for 2G, Chief Executive Officer Lars Norling told a news conference. TAC also plans to increase its number of base stations to 32,000 in early 2016 from 17,000 now, aiming to provide 4G network coverage nationwide.
The Asian Development Bank will lower its 2015 GDP growth forecast for Thailand from the current 2.9 to 3.0 per cent following weaker-than-expected performance in the first half, the Bangkok Post reported, citing Luxamon Attapich, the bank’s senior economist for Thailand.The new growth forecast, due to be announced on Sept 22, will be higher than 2.5 per cent, the paper reported.

USA

A women walks past the FR headquaters
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has made clear she would rather delay an interest rate hike for too long than move sooner and risk jeopardising a tepid economic recovery, a conviction that will face its sharpest test yet on Thursday. Having weighed the economy’s steady march toward full employment against the backdrop of weak inflation and wage growth and turbulence overseas, the US central bank will issue its latest rate decision at the end of a two-day policy meeting. A rate hike would be the first in the United States in nearly a decade. Fed watchers, however, see the outcome as a toss-up, with Yellen’s consistently stated desire to see workers reap more benefits from the recovery, coupled with weak price rises and a variety of global risks, looming large. “It is a game-time decision. The key is what Yellen thinks and my guess is that she will want to wait,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. “If you put yourself in her shoes, you don’t want to make a mistake by going too soon.”
Oil prices were stable on Thursday as a US stock draw tightened the market while Asia’s economies showed new signs of weakness.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading at USD 47.13 per barrel at 0430 GMT, virtually unchanged from their previous close, while Brent was up 6 cents at USD 49.81 per barrel. That followed a price jump of as much as six per cent in the previous session when data from the US Energy Information Administration showed the largest crude drawdown since February 2014 at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point. Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures said that the stock draw was “a result of higher refining activity and lower US crude production which is helping the US inventory glut to ease off”.

110,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

KATHMANDU
Traders are simply investing their time, thinking that if they spend a lot of time around the markets, analysing charts, reading books and studying courses, their skill level will improve. Investing time is necessary when you are starting out, as there is a lot to learn. But putting in hours will not necessarily increase your profit potential. If you always repeat the same mistakes, putting in hours will just be meaningless with those habits in place. To improve, make repeated and deliberate choices. Here are five things to start doing today to improve your trading performance.
GET HELP
Trading is tough and not a cup of tea for everyone especially when we go at it completely alone. So choose a person who could be just a friend or family member who you have told your plans to and who you keep updated on your performance. Share what you are doing, what you are struggling with and what you are having success with. Anyone can get side tracked, so be open to being told when you have gone astray. When your own discipline and self-awareness fails, you will have someone to help you get back on track.
FOLLOW YOUR PLAN
Talking about strategies with other traders or discussing your performance with your trading referee is fine, but avoid the opinions of others when it comes to specific trades. Trade your trading plan, your way. It doesn’t matter if a trader you respect says they are going to buy when your plan says to sell.
PRACTICE
A strategy may seem simple on the surface, but even a simple strategy is hard to implement in live market conditions. Every day, every trend, every pullback is slightly different; nothing looks exactly the same as it did in the textbook examples. So trade it in a demoaccount until you consistently see profit from it.
MENTAL CLARITY
Each day take one minute before you trade to make sure you are feeling clearheaded and focused. Also take a couple of seconds to reiterate that you’re here to trade, not check your social media accounts, email or watch videos online. When you trade, simply focus on trading and leave other matters. Check the economic calendar to be aware of events that may move the market, so you are not taken by surprise during the day. If you are angry, upset or unfocused, avoid trading. It only takes one day, one trade even, to lose an entire account when not in the right mind frame.
RECORD YOUR TRADE
Review every trade you make. Take screenshots of your trades with entries, stop loss levels, targets, and your technical/fundamental notes so you can easily review your trades at a later time.

KATHMANDU
Hear it verbatim from Rajesh KC on how he aspires to build a world-class Nepali brand.
“I have been drawing cartoons since 1990s. Back then they were limited to my friend’s portraits but once I got the platform, I was able to polish my skills and dedicate my time and energy to the same. It has been 25 years now and I recently expanded the skills I have to something new.”
On Phalano Luga: “Phalano Luga came to me as a pleasant surprise. A friend of mine who owned a t-shirt store asked me to design a few prints for t-shirts. While designing, I thought to myself, ‘He might give me royalty and I might make some money out of the designs but why not create a Nepali brand in itself?’ I visited stores for market evaluation and realised that even though Nepal has a lot of talent in terms of designs, the fabric was not up to the mark. Even though the t-shirts had tags that said, ‘100 per cent cotton’, something was amiss. Phalano Luga came into existence with an ambition of creating a Nepali brand for Nepalis to wear. With the fabric imported from Ludhiana, India, and the manufacturing factory located in Patan, I have been able to give the market what I had in mind. The printing machines are imported from California and are top class and that is how I had imagined my brand to be — uncompromising and pocket-friendly.”
On growth: “Initially, I had a target of selling at least one t-shirt per day. I thought that the concept of a Nepali brand might take some time to build but I am surprised with the exponential growth Phalano Luga has seen. In the past two years, my dream of selling one t-shirt per day has topped 30 t-shirts per day.”
On workers: “This is one of the bigger challenges I face. Retaining workers and getting the best ones is a big challenge. A group of Nepali workers are coming back to Nepal from Malaysia to work with me. Apart from retaining them, paying them the same amount they used to earn overseas is a challenge. The people I am working with right now are also working with the production unit of Nike, Adidas, Peter England and other such global brands, based in Nepal. The problem is not the quality of the workers, but the economy and the quality of local materials available.”
On funds: “While starting the business off, my bank was skeptical about giving me a loan. My capital investment was close to one crore and after convincing the bank, I had 30 per cent of the costs covered. Most of the funds were drawn from my own pockets.”
On new ventures: “As of now, with more than satisfactory sales, I have the confidence of expanding my business across the country and abroad. But my first priority would be maintaining the quality for a while before dreaming big. Phalano Coffeeghar which is the latest addition to my business venture is something I am looking up to for now. With Phalano Luga doing well, I partnered with an old friend, Prem Aryal and opened the cafe last week. I had the space and he had the ideas, we got together and came up with the Coffeeghar plan. Like the tees, the eatables available at the cafe will all be Nepali-centric. Long term plans for this cafe are branded water bottles and sugar sachets.”
On the future: “I aspire to make Phalano Luga as big as Nike and Adidas.”

Kathmandu
With the country in dire need of post disaster economic recovery, it is expected that governing bodies address the concerns of major contributors to the GDP. The advertising industry is one such sector with the potential to help with economic recovery; and could provide a significant push towards an economic boom, just as the country needs it the most.
Advertising helps create successful businesses, which then lead to employment opportunities. Even media, the driving force behind growing economies, benefits from stability in the industry, as advertising is the chief source of revenue for mass media like newspapers, television, radio, print magazines and websites. Research has consistently shown that countries with larger investments in the advertising industry are more developed than other countries. For instance, the advertisement industry in the United States creates 18.2 million of the 126.7 million jobs. However, back home in Nepal, the predicament of the advertising industry is such that the government is yet to give due recognition to the industry.
According to the Advertising Association of Nepal (AAN), the total annual revenue of the advertising
industry is Rs 5.5 billion. While it is an industry with vast potential; it appears to lack order with various unresolved issues brimming under the surface.
The present scenario
Although at a very slow pace, the industry was witnessing growth before disaster struck. Post earthquake, the scenario looks far from encouraging. Is there a noticeable difference in the industry before and after the earthquake? Ranjit Acharya, CEO of Prisma Advertising says, “Before the earthquake, the industry was in its growing stage. Growth was rather slow but it was growing
nonetheless. Post earthquake, advertising agencies had to cut down on budgets, as it was the need of the hour. With no help from any quarter it was a necessity to cut down costs.” According to him, most businesses had to cut down on advertising budgets, which led to stagnancy in the industry. He says, “A person must seek medical help when ill and not cut down on medicinal costs. The same is with
advertisements.”
Deependra Tandon, Director of Business Advantage says, “In the first few months after the disaster in April/May we did not have any business. We have gradually recovered now and we hope that the business will revive in the festive season.” He adds that the business is still in its infancy and there is room for improvement.
Ahimsa Yonjan, Managing Partner at TBWA\Benchmark Nepal, says, “The earthquakes led to a rather disturbing slowdown for a month or two, but considering everything that has happened, the industry looks to have weathered the storm rather well”. He adds, “However, as an industry, we do not seem to have learned much from the experience, as there is actually very little difference in communication styles or brand behaviour before or after the earthquakes.”
The mushrooming of advertising agencies
AAN has 298 advertising agencies on its member roster, but there still exist several hundred more agencies that are not registered with the association. With so many advertising agencies operating in the market, it is still generally accepted that most of the advertisements that are produced in Nepal are not satisfactory. On this, Santosh Shrestha, President of AAN says, “Because there is no entry barrier to this industry, anyone can register and have an agency up and running in no time. While this opens a lot of doors for newcomers it leads to compromise on the quality. It becomes a tough job to monitor quality.” He further says, “The world of advertising is creative and fascinating. In Nepal, the industry has an estimated growth of 10 to 15 per cent annually. If we focus on quality control, nothing can stop this industry from growing in the coming years.”
Advertising agencies and advertisement standards
On the compromised quality of advertising and agencies not being up to the mark, Shrestha says, “The quality of advertisement depends of the level of awareness of the society, resources, budget and the economy. Advertisements reflect the attitude of the society. The market is small and the economy is not
progressive. The current focus is on production of effective advertisements rather than creative ones.”
He adds that they are responsible to cater to the mass with limited budget. He says, “Suppose there are three kids who study in grade three, six and eight. Now, all of them must be explained to in a similar manner, in a language they can comprehend. The teacher explains in the easiest way so that every one can understand. The same goes with advertisement.”
Joydeb Chackravarty, Managing Director, JWT – Thompson Nepal has a different view on this subject. He says, “Nepali consumers are exposed to creative advertisements, if not from within the country, but definitely from the world outside. They are intelligent and they know exactly what they want.
Advertisers should not underestimate their level of awareness and should not doubt their intelligence.”
He says that it is high time for the industry to push the envelope in terms of standards and creativity.
Yonjan says, “While I do agree that the overall quality of advertising could be a lot better, I think it is quite unfair to generalise and say that the quality of advertising agencies is not up to the mark. There are a few agencies doing good work locally, so we must give credit where it is due.” He further says, “As with any other industry however, a combination of many factors; such as, lack of industry knowledge and processes, timelines, an unwillingness to provide proper compensation on the side of all parties involved, leads to a large proportion of work being of poor quality. It is the same with art, music and movies. Much of what is produced is quite terrible, but there are those that stand out.”
The clean feed debate
For almost eight years now, AAN has lobbied with the government to introduce a Clean Feed Policy. This policy will ensure content filtering systems that can be used to block foreign commercials aired through foreign channels from reaching the Nepali audience. The main purpose of this policy will be to eliminate the trend of dubbing and encourage multinationals to produce and develop advertisements through local agencies.
Nirmal Raj Poudel, CEO of Welcome Advertising and Marketing, says, “Multinational companies dub foreign advertisements and broadcast them in local channels.  Further, the paid channels also include commercials. This results in quality compromise.”
However, some industrialists claim that clean feed is an uphill task in Nepal. They argue that competition will be killed with the introduction of this policy. A Clean Feed Committee has meanwhile been formed by AAN that has been doing research on the topic and is under dialogue with the government for a quick implementation of this policy.
The right way of doing things
According to some, one of the biggest challenges the industry currently faces is the lack of vision and leadership within the industry. Only self- regulation and quality checks can turn the industry around. Tandon says, “The change must start with the industry itself. Introducing policies is not enough for the development of the industry.” Yonjan has similar views, he says, “We cannot introduce laws to control or fix what are inherently industry problems. What is more necessary is an independent regulatory body that can develop and enforce a code of conduct/best practice model in place for the overall advertising market.”
Although the advertising industry is currently facing an uphill battle, this is still an industry that has enormous potential. With the industry only just beginning to mature, and mediums like digital and new age media opening up, there appears to be much to look forward to for the industry. For the rest of us, it remains the industry to watch.
In parting, it is perhaps Chakravarty who sums it up best — “The next five years are going to be challenging for the advertising industry in Nepal. However, if we follow the right way of doing things and remain honest and integrated there are chances that we can recover soon.”

The monsoon struck the village mid-June, but officials of Sangachowk VDC are still struggling to distribute cash relief to villagers.
Currently, the villagers are living inside temporary shelters made from rusted zinc sheets riddled with holes and timber salvaged from their damaged houses. They kept some zinc sheets and timber to shelter their cattle and poultry after distribution of relief amount was delayed.
Shyam Khadka, 55, of Pokhre said,”The rain water trickles through the zinc sheets. The families of my three sons are housed under one small temporary shelter. Even if the government distributes relief money it will not be sufficient to procure zinc sheets to construct temporary shelters that will accommodate the families of my three sons.”
Basanta Prasad Ghimire, secretary, Sangachowk VDC said cash relief had not been distributed as the registered households claiming cash relief outnumbered the actual damaged households.
“Over 28,000 households have registered for cash relief, whereas, the District Administration Office has allocated cash relief for only 22,000 households on the basis of existing documented records before the earthquake of April 25,” he said.
The government had announced immediate cash relief of Rs 15,000 for one damaged house. The joint families who have not legally divided properties are not eligible for immediate cash relief even if they had been staying in separate houses.
“The joint families who lost more than one house registered fore cash relief under names of different members of the same family,” Ghimire said, stressing that families who had lost more than one house are not satisfied with government policy.
He warned that a monitoring team comprising ward citizens’ forum would be deployed to find such joint families who had registered more than once for the same house before issuing the ID card to claim immediate cash relief and Rs 200,000 to further build a permanent house.
The government released Rs 5.53 billion to the local authorities for immediate relief countrywide in May.
According to District Disaster Relief Committee, the death toll was 3,656 in Sindhupalchowk. About 90 per cent of houses in the district were razed to the ground.

116,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/duplication-in-tax-headings-draws-flak/,"KATHMANDU: The draft of the new constitution has overlooked the concerns related to effective levying of major taxes and duplicated some tax headings in central and state governments, as well as provincial and local governments.
Such duplications might pose a threat to the revenue system once the country adopts a federal structure due to disputes of power allocation between central and provincial government to levy taxes, according to tax experts.
The draft constitution has proposed that excise and individual income tax can be levied by both the central and provincial governments. Similarly, it has also proposed that many other tax headings be levied by the provincial and local governments, like registration tax, vehicle tax and tourist fee.
“Even as related Acts will have to be formulated, the power allocation in the central, provincial and local governments will result in disputes when the laws related to taxes are enforced in the coming days,” opined Rup Khadka, tax expert and the chair of the government-formed High Level Tax System Review Commission. The draft constitution has extended authority to levy taxes, but it is silent on power allocation regarding enforcement, like what portion of the excise duty and IIT can be levied by the province and the portion of the registration and vehicle and land tax that can be levied by the local government.
Giving an example of South Sudan, Khadka said, “The taxes proposed to be levied by the central government were also placed in the domain of provincial government, which led to a dispute. It was later sorted out by forming a task force under the chairmanship of the finance minister of the centre, comprising finance ministers of provinces.”
According to him, it would be better to extend the authority to levy a certain tax to a particular government that can effectively levy that duty. “That power can be shared among other governments.”
The HLTSRC has suggested the finance committee of the Parliament to put customs, VAT, excise, corporate and individual income tax under the domain of the central government for effective enforcement, as these taxes are of stra-tegic importance and strong institutional mechanism is required to levy them effectively. Likewise, registration tax and vehicle tax have been recommended to be levied by provincial government.
Who is to levy what
Central government: Customs, excise, value added tax, corporate income tax, individual income tax, passport fee, visa fee, penalties and royalty of natural resources Provincial government: Wage tax (which covers large portion of individual income tax), land tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, excise, entertainment tax, advertisement tax, tourist fees, agriculture income tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources
Local government: Land and rent tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, service fees, tourist fees, business tax, entertainment tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources

117,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/development-bond-yields-fall-to-all-time-low/,"KATHMANDU: Yield on development bonds, regardless of their maturity period, has fallen to an all-time low, dampening sentiment of bankers, who have to tap the government securities market to meet some of the regulatory requirements.
Return on 15-year development bonds floated today by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) dropped to 2.65 per cent, the lowest since February 1964, when the government first introduced development bonds with a maturity period of five years to raise debt from the domestic market to finance development activities.
Surprisingly, returns on these securities are falling lately even as their maturity period is increasing.
When NRB auctioned five-year development bonds on May 28, the weighted average cut-off rate stood at four per cent. Then on June 4, when it floated seven-year development bonds, the return fell to 3.44 per cent.
The yield further dropped to 3.08 per cent when NRB offered nine-year development bonds on June 11.
The freefall continued on June 25 as well, when 10-year development bonds were floated. At that time, the weighted average interest rate had dropped to 2.99 per cent.
Considering 7.1 per cent inflation of mid-May, returns on these securities are negative in real term.
“Yields on bonds are falling rapidly because of excess liquidity in the banking sector,” Nara Bahadur Thapa, chief of Public Debt Management Department at NRB told The Himalayan Times.
Banks and financial institutions (BFIs) are currently sitting on excess liquidity of over Rs 70 billion. However, a large chunk of this money cannot be extended as loans because it is being used to meet the minimum regulatory net liquid asset to total deposit ratio, or LD ratio, of 20 per cent.
So, BFIs are rushing to grab these low-yielding securities assuming it is wiser to invest funds in bonds and get some returns rather than let them sit in coffers and generate no return.
Lately, what also appears to have exerted pressure on yields is the government’s decision to repay a part of debt.
So far this fiscal, the government has repaid Rs 42.55 billion of debt, including principal, shows the latest NRB report.
On the other hand, fresh government securities worth only Rs 42.34 billion have been floated in the market. This means net borrowing of the government stood at a negative of around Rs 211 million.
“Because of this, BFIs are rushing to replenish their stock of government securities to maintain LD ratio. This is raising the demand for bonds,” Thapa said, adding, “This is another reason for fall in bond returns.”
The falling bond return is, in fact, good news for the government, as it is now able to raise domestic debt at low interest rates. This means the cost of rebuilding parts of the country ravaged by the earthquake would be a little cheaper.
But bankers say this is creating ‘distortions’ in the market.
“Many BFIs that have purchased low-yielding instruments are now carrying a lot of market risk,” said Sashin Joshi, CEO of Nabil Bank.
This is because purchase of nine-, 10- and 15-year bonds is not a short-term investment, according to Joshi.
“And if returns on bonds rise next year, the instruments bought this year will turn into nothing but loss-making tools. At that time, many BFIs will have no option but to sell those instruments at a discount. This may hit their profitability as well,” Joshi added.

KATHMANDU: There is now little doubt that Pashupati Murarka, officiating president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), will take the helm of the largest private sector umbrella body tomorrow.
Murarka taking the lead of FNCCI has become a certainty after the two other contenders — Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar and Bhawani Rana — withdrew their candidacy for the post of FNCCI president from the election slated for tomorrow.
Organising a press meet on Tuesday, Rajkarnikar had announced his willingness to withdraw his candidacy and support Murarka if Rana also did the same. After Rana formally withdrew her candidacy yesterday, Rajkarnikar also formally pulled out his application today.
So, Murarka is the sole contender for the top post of FNCCI and will be announced as the unanimous president tomorrow. It also means that the post of senior vice president, which Murarka held before he took on the role of officiating chief of FNCCI, will be vacant.
Murarka had been appointed as the officiating president after its past president Pradeep Jung Pandey was arrested in a three-decade old corruption charge on March 18.
As per the FNCCI statute, election of the senior vice president should be done within five days of the president’s election. The senior vice president is elected from the executive committee, though the rest of the posts are filled through direct election.
According to FNCCI sources, there is general consensus among FNCCI members to select Bhawani Rana for the post of senior vice president. Leaders of the largest private sector umbrella body have claimed that rifts and groupism that occurred during the past elections will be bridged after the selection of a unanimous chief at FNCCI.

Nepal is hosting the Donors’ Conference for the reconstruction of the country in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes.
“Media reports that there was clash between us and there was lack of coordination while sending invitations to neighbouring countries are baseless. The finance minister and I were supposed to go to India and China respectively. But, I cancelled my visit to China after Chinese authorities informed us that Chinese foreign minister will not be able to participate in the conference due to prior engagement,” Pandey told the meeting of
National Disaster Management and Monitoring Special Committee of the Legislature Parliament headed by Speaker Subas Chandra Nembang today.
Finance Minister Mahat said that his ministry had prepared the 300-page Post Disaster Need Assessment, with the help of more than 200 experts divided into 23 sub-panels by working round the clock in view of the conference. “This is the official document of the government detailing the damage and need assessment. This document has created the base to see support from donor countries and inter-country agencies,” Mahat said.
The government has invited 65 countries and inter-governmental agencies, said Finance Mahat, adding: “Of them, 125 delegates of 40 countries and agencies have already expressed their commitment to participate in the conference”. Seven minister-level participants have sent their confirmation to participate in the conference, according to Mahat.
“Initially, donor countries wished to delay the conference to August-September. Citing the devastating earthquake situation, they proposed to hold the conference in New Delhi of India, Tokyo of Japan and Paris of France. They were reluctant to participate in the conference expressing their doubt over the safety of the participants as the situation had not been normal. However, we persistently stood on our stance of holding the conference in Kathmandu and made all arrangements for their safe living during their stay here. Ultimately, the donors were convinced and are expressing their commitment for their participation,” Mahat said.
Mahat said that the government would focus on foreign grant collection, sharing experiences of managing post-disaster situation and solidarity of friendly nations to Nepal’s crisis.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Pandey said that the government wanted to show the international community that the country was safe for tourism and it maintained complete harmony during the national crisis despite having around 125 different communities.
Mahat, responding to a complaint that Russian ambassador in Kathmandu did not get invitation till last Wednesday due to the government’s carelessness, said, “The government, six weeks ago, had emailed all the embassies and ambassadors in Kathmandu, making preliminary request to participate in the conference. The [Russian] ambassador had replied us via email that the country’s representative would not be able to participate in the conference due to pre-scheduled engagement on the conference day. Then, we did not send invitation to him. But, after we heard about the complaint, we have sent an invitation recently.”
Lawmakers including CPN-UML’s Madhav Kumar Nepal, Nepali Congress’s Ramchandra Paudel and Unified CPN-Maoist’s Girirajmani Pokharel, had urged the ministries to clarify the controversies related to the conference and suggested them to make the conference a success.
After listening to the two ministers, panel Chair Nembang instructed the government to take the neighboring countries and donors into confidence and also consultations with all the parties and take their feedback. Nembang also instructed the government to make an arrangement for making the foreign delegates observe the major tourist areas — both damaged and not damaged — independently during their visit to give a message that Nepal is safe for foreign tourists.

Though liver transplantation services are available in the country, many patients are compelled to pay a hefty amount for the service in foreign countries due to lack of information.
“On an average, 60 Nepalis visit hospitals in India for liver transplants despite the fact that  liver transplantation services are available in the country that also at a cheaper price,” said Dr Ramesh Singh Bhandari gastrointestinal and hepato-pancreato-biliary surgeon at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital.
“Lack of knowledge about the availability of liver transplantation services is one of the major reasons,” pointed out Dr Bhandari.
“It is also true that when it comes to any organ transplantation services, many people do not trust Nepali doctors” he added.
Patients and their families need to be properly informed and counselled about the services available in Nepal as they are skeptic about transplantation services here, he said.
He said liver donors also did not have to be afraid about donating their liver fearing  complications.
“Liver donors will not have to face any long-term health complications. Therefore, one does not need to be scared of donating donation,” said the doctor.
“Chances of health complications in liver donors are less than one per cent. Hepatic ducts need to be closed to prevent leakage in the donors. Some are likely to develop hernia in area where there is a cut which usually appears when one is not much concerned about his/her health,” said Dr Bhandari.
Perspective donors should undergo check-up and meet medical requirements. From among 10 possible donors, only two or three meet the requirements.
“The country provides quality transplantation service at low cost to both the patients and donors. Therefore, people need not go to India or any other countries for transplantation,” added Dr Bhandari.
One needs to undergo liver transplantation if his/her liver stops functioning. The major causes of liver failure are excessive consumption of alcohol and chronic hepatitis.

On an average 2,000 people are killed in road accidents in a year

Kathmandu, December 20
The Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Executive Committee has tasked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport and Nepal Police with the responsibility of forming a survey team to carry out mapping of road accident black spots along the highways.
In the wake of a bus plunge that claimed at least 14 lives in Dolakha district on December 15, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had directed the authorities concerned to come up with a concrete action plan to reduce road accidents across the country. Road accident stands as a major killer in Nepal. On an average, 2,000 people are killed and thousands injured in road accidents every year.
According to Under-secretary Shambu Prasad Regmi at the Ministry of Home Affairs, a recent meeting of DRRMEC held in Singha Durbar had decided to ask the MoPIT and Nepal Police to identify the road sections more vulnerable to accidents triggered by fog, mist and snowfall, and erect traffic signs on the roadside for providing necessary information to road users, especially drivers, about the precautionary measures to be adopted to avoid crash.
For this, the MoPIT and Nepal Police will conduct a comprehensive survey to identify the black spots on the highways. The Ministry of Finance and concerned provincial governments and local levels have been told to cooperate with the MoPIT and Nepal Police in their efforts to tackling road accidents.
Nepal Police said adverse weather condition was one of the reasons of increasing road accidents during the winter season in Nepal.
Accidents occurred due to fog and mist reducing visibility at blind corners along the roads. Though natural condition cannot be avoided, necessary safety measures help to prevent road accidents. A report of Nepal Police showed that other key factors for road accident included driver’s negligence, overspeeding, drink driving, recklessness of passengers, inadequate safety barriers, random roadside parking, dilapidated roads, lack of awareness of traffic rules and poor road engineering.
The MoHA has written to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration to put all local levels on standby to prevent the loss of lives due to cold waves in the winter.
The country faces cold waves which could cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife and people, mainly the elderly and children. Many parts of the Tarai remain covered in thick blanket of fog blocking sunlight for days during the peak of the winter.
In response to the letter from the MoHA, the MoFAGA  yesterday issued a circular to local levels, directing them to raise awareness about risk of hypothermia and ways of protecting oneself from cold. The circular has also directed local authorities to distribute warm blankets to needy people, arrange bonfires, coordinate with the district disaster management committees and work in association with security agencies, district public health offices and hospitals to minimise the impact of cold weather.

Police have arrested a person from Tokha Municipality-9 for abducting three children and taking them hostage to demand ransom, while rescuing the victims from his clutches unharmed.
The person taken into custody by Metropolitan Police Range is Binod Thapa Magar, 26, of Gorkha. Police said Ashish Sijapati, 24, of Kailali was the alleged mastermind of the kidnapping. He was arrested from Makwanpur in connection with similar offence on Tuesday. He was among five persons arrested for abducting Naresh Thapa Magar, 21, of Ramechhap.
According to police, Sijapati kidnapped a boy and two girls, all below 14 years, from Samakhushi, Kathmandu, on Monday when their mother left for Pokhara leaving them to fend for themselves for a few days. Sijapati, who was a close acquaintance of the family, lured them to Tokha-based Hotel Blue Star. He convinced the minors saying that their mother had told him to keep them in a hotel until she returned to Kathmandu.
Following the abduction and hostage-taking of the three children on Monday, Sijapati and his associates kidnapped Naresh and were arrested the next day. Police investigators said Sijapati had tasked Binod with the responsibility of locking the three children up in room number 404 of the hotel.
Three days after the abduction, Sijapati called their mother on phone and said that her children were under his control and demanded a ransom of Rs 300,000 for their safe release. The same day, she returned to Kathmandu, but found her rented room locked from outside.
The grieving mother alerted the police about the kidnapping. Acting on a tip-off, police carried out a massive search operation, leading to their rescue from the hotel room today.
Police said  Thapa had been booked for kidnapping and hostage-taking, while Sijapati was in custody of Makwanpur District Police Office in connection with the same charge. Metropolitan Police Range informed that further investigation into the case was under way.

Police arrested two persons with 248 grams of gold they collected from returnee Nepali migrant workers at Tribhuvan International Airport yesterday.
Security officials said Bikram Pokharel, 23, of Lalbandi Municipality-5, Sarlahi, and Binod Kandel, 27, of Phalebas Municipality-11, Parbat, had allegedly used migrant workers returning from Gulf countries to carry permissible amount of gold, promising them a high wage.
According to Central Police News Section, Pokharel was caught in the act of collecting 149 grams of gold and three laptops from three migrant workers. He is suspected to
be colluding with foreign-based racketeers active in sending gold in small consignments through returnee migrant workers. The gold seized from him was in the form
of bracelets.
Two golden bracelets weighing 99 grams were confiscated from Kandel. Unlike Pokharel, Kandel, who is himself a migrant worker, had arrived in Kathmandu from Dubai. Police said he had asked one of his co-workers to carry one golden bracelet for him. He was held from the parking area of Tribhuvan International Airport during security screening.
Both of them have been handed over to Tribhuvan International Airport Customs Office for further investigation and legal action. An overseas returnee is allowed to carry gold up to 50 grams in the form of ornament. However, racketeers have been misusing this provision by making migrant workers to carry permissible quantity of gold as ornament.
Generally, racketeers pay wage of around Rs 6,000 to each migrant worker for carrying home 50 grams of gold, police investigators said. In some cases, migrant workers are paid by the racketeers from the Gulf via wire after the consignment of gold is received by the concerned person in Nepal.
Smuggling and illegal trade of gold is rife in the country. As many as 110 persons were arrested with 123.9 kilograms of undeclared gold from different parts of the country, including Tribhuvan International Airport, in the 2018-19. Monetary value of the seized gold is around Rs 444.5 million.
According to Nepal Police, the law enforcement agency had stepped up action against persons involved in gold smuggling and illegal trade, transaction and sale of the precious yellow metal by maintaining greater vigil against the suspects. Security and customs officials are on high alert to respond to newer modes of smuggling adopted by gold smugglers.

The first meeting of the Bill Session of the House of Representatives today concluded calling its next meeting for December 27 when the process of electing a new speaker will start.
In the absence of a speaker, Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe chaired today’s meeting which began with Tumbahamphe reading out President Bidhya Devi Bhandari’s message, followed by passage of a few condolence motions. The speaker’s post has remained vacant since Krishna Bahadur Mahara was arrested on attempt-to-rape charge.
Parliament Secretariat Spokesperson Dasharath Dhamala said although not formally decided, the December 27 meeting was likely to announce a date for the election of the new speaker to begin the election process.
However, election of a new speaker is not as simple as it looks, thanks to the constitution’s provision in Article 91 (2) that states the speaker or the deputy speaker has to be a woman, representing different parties.
This means that the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) cannot file nomination for the speaker’s post until Tumbahamphe, who represents the NCP, resigns. If she does not resign, the NCP has to give up the speaker’s post. However, the NCP is in no mood to give up the crucial post of speaker even at the expense of deputy speaker’s post.
At the same time, Tumbahamphe must resign even if she is to be elected speaker to be eligible to file her nomination for the post. This means Tumbahamphe’s resignation is imminent and the election for both speaker and deputy speaker will take place in the Parliament.
However, Tumbahamphe has not yet decided whether to resign. “Our party’s leadership has not consulted me on this matter, neither formally nor informally,” she told THT. “The leadership must consult me first for me to reach a conclusion on this matter. Morally, I cannot just put in my papers and render the HoR leaderless.”
Although aspiring leaders have been lobbying for the post, party insiders say no formal discussion has taken place in the party as leaders are busy with the ongoing standing committee meeting.
Agni Sapkota, representing the former CPN-Maoist Centre, and Subas Nembang, representing the erstwhile CPN-UML, appear front-runners for now.
The standing committee too has not discussed the matter, according to NCP standing committee member Pampha Bhusal. “Co-chairmen Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal will take the decision, as discussion in the standing committee could slow the decision making process,” Bhusal told THT. “The senior-most lawmaker can chair the meeting after the deputy speaker resigns to begin the election process.”
Despite the constitutional provision, the NCP had kept both the posts of speaker and deputy speaker on grounds that Mahara (from former CPN-MC) and Tumbahamphe (from former CPN-UML) belonged to different parties at the time of their appointment. The two parties later merged to form the NCP.
Meanwhile, today’s HoR meeting was supposed to be addressed by leaders of parliamentary parties, but was later dropped from the business as per the decision of the Parliamentary Business Advisory Committee meeting chaired by Tumbahamphe.
Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal leader Laxman Lal Karna said the committee decided that leaders would address the HoR only after it got a new speaker.
Meanwhile, the National Assembly held its first meeting of the Bill Session today. The meeting began with NA Chairperson Ganesh Prasad Timilsina reading out the president’s message. It was followed by addresses from NA parliamentary party leaders — Dinanath Sharma from the NCP, Surendra Raj Pandey from the Nepali Congress, Pramila Kumari from the Samajwadi Party-Nepal and Brikhesh Chandra Lal from RJP-N.
The NA has called its next meeting on Monday. Parliament Secretariat Spokesperson Dhamala said the agenda for Monday’s NA meeting would be finalised by Sunday.

At the interaction held on Friday morning, Press Registrar Rewati Prasad Sapkota talked on the potential and challenges of online journalism. Describing journalism as a mirror of the society, he said, online journalism at present has been facing challenges as the media houses have to find the readers, recalling that previously readers had to find and choose from the traditional printed news.
Moreover, he said social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube among others have limited the business opportunities from online journalism in the sense they cover up news as well as advertisement.

During the event, journalist former editor of Pahilo Post and renowned blogger of mysansar, Umesh Shrestha made a presentation of the history of online journalism in Nepal. He presented how media houses in the early 90s faced challenges when Nepali fonts could be displayed only in Unicode and had to be downloaded and converted in lack of complete access to the international digital world.
He also revealed how media houses producing news in local languages had abandoned online journalism after struggling to raise funds and sorting out a clear source of income. Shrestha asserted that at present, online readers or consumers rely on news stories published without verification. He remarked that fake stories published online could cause chaos among readers.
Likewise, media expert Prabesh Subedi talked about technical issues faced by online institutions in the country. Focusing on ‘internet and its advantages, Subedi expressed that the internet was an open space for all fields and sectors.
He further shared that 66 per cent of the total population in the country had access to the internet of which 55 per cent are using costly mobile internet while 15 per cent are using stable internet.
He also advised that the press registrar’s office should arrange training sessions in order to increase digital literacy rate so as to increase local consumers of online products including news.
“Province 3 government should focus on developing online media houses as an online business firm,” stressed Subedi. He gave an example of how the BBC, apart from being a news agency, has established itself as the seller of goods such as watches among other products.
The Chief Guest at the workshop, Minister of Internal Affairs and Law of Province 3 Salikram Jamarkattel stressed the need for monitoring and regulating media houses. He opined that media houses should assist the provincial government in the amendment of the constitution rather than criticising it.
On the occasion, Provincial Affairs Committee President Madhav Poudel said the press management and regularisation was a necessary step. He urged mediapersons to support the provincial government in making an amendment to the bill related to the press.
Likewise, Nepal Communist Party (NCP)’s Province 3 Parliamentary Party Chief Whip Rameshwar Phuyal also stressed the need for making an amendment to the bill. He said the provincial government was looking forward to discouraging malpractices of producing fake news by taking actions after making changes to the codes.
During the interaction, section officer at the Ministry of Social Development, Asim Ghising was of the view that there was no country where there was zero censorship of media while Federation of Nepali Journalist (FNJ) Kathmandu representative argued that online media houses must have press freedom at any cost.
Press registrar Sapkota disclosed that the registrar’s office was going to hold ‘Mobile Journalism Training Session’. He also revealed that the office had planned to establish a welfare fund for journalists.
The registrar further said fellowships and allowances of about Rs 50,000 would be provided to women journalists given the challenges and  pressures they have to face during and after maternity leave.
Sapkota concluded the event on sharing that the registrar’s office had a view of changing the process for registering online media houses and providing new identity cards.

It is of utmost importance to regularly convene the meetings of the Charter bodies at all levels.” Stating that summits provide renewed impetus to SAARC, he hoped that a consensus will be reached soon among the member states to convene the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad.
Convened under the chairmanship of Ram Prasad Subedi joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal, the Committee is to review progress of regional cooperation in a number of priority areas of the SAARC.

Kathmandu, December 19
Patan High Court today upheld Kathmandu District Court’s decision to send former speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara, who has been accused of attempt to rape, to judicial custody.
The high court also ordered KDC to adjudicate the case against Mahara within one month after completing all court proceedings, including the process to record statements of witnesses and the victim. The high court observed that since prima facie evidence went against Mahara, he could not be freed on bail or personal recognizance.

The high court said although Mahara denied going to the victim’s rented room on the day the alleged incident occurred, his aide-de–camp Kaji Ram Rana Magar recorded his statement at the police saying that he accompanied Mahara to the victim’s place and Mahara had returned to his car parked outside the victim’s home after almost one-and-half-hours. The high court also cited victim’s phone call to police, lawmaker Uma Regmi and her statement to journalist Ajay Babu Siwakoti telling them that Mahara attempted to rape her.
KDC had sent Mahara to judicial custody on November 4. He was arrested by Kathmandu police after Roshani Shahi, a staffer at the Parliament Secretariat filed an FIR on October 4, accusing him of attempting to rape her on the night of September-29, in her rented room at Tinkune.
Mahara filed a petition at the high court on November 21 challenging the District Court’s decision to send him to judicial custody. Mahara resigned from the post of speaker in the face of the accusation after the ruling
Nepal Communist Party (NCP) told him to quit both posts of speaker and member of Parliament. Mahara was elected MP from Dang constituency-2.
Babu Ram Dahal registrar at the high court said, “The division bench of judges Nahakul Subedi and Tek Narayan Kunwar upheld the  KDC’s order to send Mahara to judicial custody.”
Mahara’s private lawyer Murai Prasad Sapkota said “We had to knock the high court doors because the District Court misinterpreted the law. Mahara was denied opportunity of free and fair trial and the evidences produced before the court were not examined properly.”
Sapkota also said since his client was not entitled to move the Supreme Court with similar claim, he would now challenge his judicial custody through a habeas corpus writ petition.
Kathmandu District Attorney’s Office had filed case against Mahara seeking seven-and-half-years jail sentence — five years for attempt to rape and two-and-half-years for committing the crime by misusing the power of office.
Mahara was arrested on October 6 in response to the FIR filed by Shahi. She later had turned hostile by telling various media that Mahara was innocent and he had not visited her room on the day of the alleged incident. She had also filed a separate petition at the court stating that the police had coerced her to file the FIR against Mahara.
Advocate Sapkota said, “District Court issued the order without hearing statement of the so-called victim Roshani, who had been saying that Mahara never entered her room and he was like a father figure for her.”

The second national conference of police and government attorneys is set to begin in Kathmandu on Friday.
The three-day conference is expected to serve as a platform for resolving differences frequently arising between police (investigators) and government attorneys (prosecutors) in the course of delivering justice to crime victims, said Inspector General of Police Sarbendra Khanal at a press meet organised to provide information about the gathering today.
“We hope that this conference will help us develop a common assumption on crime investigation and prosecution, and make it more scientific,” he said. Joint Attorney General Lokraj Parajuli said police and government attorneys were complementary in criminal justice administration. The conference will be useful to maintain coordination between police officers and government attorneys to make crime investigation and prosecution more effective and implement the new penal code in a professional way.
A common misunderstanding between police officers and government attorneys is that the former often blame the latter of weakening the case filed at the court to let the suspects off the hook. Government attorneys also accuse police of failing to conduct effective and evidence-based investigation before asking the former to file a case.
Such conflict between investigators and prosecutors often lead the court either to hand down lenient punishment or order release of the guilty. Both investigators and prosecutors have a common goal in criminal justice system.

The government is launching rotavirus vaccination for children below five years of age from June. The vaccine will be included in the National Immunisation Programme run by the government.
Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in young children across the world, according to World Health Organisation.
In Nepal, diarrhoea is one of the most common illnesses among children and continues to be major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, according to Ministry of Health and Population.

“The vaccination prevents diarrhoea caused by rotavirus in children under five years of age. It will help reduce death of children from complications of diarrhoea,” said Dr Jhalak Gautam chief of Child Health and Immunisation Section at Family Welfare Division.
The government aims to vaccinate 620,000 children against rotavirus. “The vaccine will be given to the children in two doses. The first dose of the vaccine will be given to a child when s/he is six months old and the next dose will be given when the child reaches ten months,” said Gautam. The vaccines will be available at 16,000 health centres across the country.
“The virus is responsible for 30 per cent of all diarrhoeal hospitalisation,” said Bharat Bhandari, immunisation officer at FWD.
Nepal Demographic Health Survey-2016, findings showed that prevalence of diarrhoea among children below five was eight per cent. The data also revealed that six per cent of children below six months suffered from diarrhoea. The data also revealed that 15.2 per cent of children below 12 months had diarrhoea.
“The vaccine will help to decrease number of rotavirus infection and help prevent under five mortality,” said Gautam. According to NDHS, under five mortality rate is 39 deaths per 1,000 live births.
Nepal Health Sector Strategy 2016- 2021 targets are to reduce neonatal and under five mortality to 17.5 and 28 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively by the year 2021.
Sustainable Development Goal targets related to neonatal and under five mortality in Nepal are 12 and 20 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively by 2030.
“We are launching the vaccine to prevent children from rotavirus infection and help control under five mortality rate,” said Bhandari.
The division has already appropriated budget of five crore for the programme.
“The order for the vaccine have already been made and it is likely to arrive in April,” said Bhandari.

Thamel is getting rid of chunks of wires and cables dangling from utility poles ahead of the much-touted Visit Nepal 2020, but this initiative to beautify Nepal’s most famous backpackers hub has caused inconvenience to businesses, as they have lost access to landline telephone and internet services, which are a must to communicate and accept digital payments.
The Thamel Tourism Development Council (TTDC) launched a drive to remove all types of wires dangling from utility poles four days ago in a bid to make the tourist hub cleaner. This has left Thamel, which is home to around 6,000 businesses, without internet or landline telephone connection. It is not known how long it will take for these services to be restored.

“The initiative to beautify Thamel is noteworthy. But the wires should have been removed after providing alternative access to phone and internet service,” said Bidur Rajopadhaya, the operator of Deluxe Money Exchange at Thamel Chowk.
Businesses like Rajopadhaya’s entirely depend on landline phone service as they have to use point of sales terminals where debit and credit cards are swiped to settle payments. “I’m worried about losing business because Christmas is the time when business volume increases and I have no phone connection,” said Rajopadhaya.
Many shops in Thamel that accept debit and credit cards are also seeing a slump in business, as foreigners, who do not carry cash, are not buying anything. One such shop is owned by Sunil Thapa.
“There has been very little business transaction in my shop in the last four days because most of the foreigners do not carry cash these days,” said Thapa, who owns a handicraft shop.
Hotels are facing similar problems. They have not been able to take stock of online bookings and communicate with clients because of interruption in internet service. “Worse, our guests are complaining about not being able to communicate with their families and friends in their home countries,” said Raman Adhikari, operator of Hotel Summit.
The TTDC has acknowledged that their move has caused inconvenience to businesses. “But we had to do this as Thamel has become ugly because of tonnes of wires dangling from utility poles,” said TTDC President Prakash Narsingh Rana.
He added, “We launched this drive after holding discussions with local authorities, businesses, police, Nepal Telecommunications Authority and internet service providers. We also published a public notice in a newspaper on December 3 about this drive.”
The Internet Service Providers’ Association of Nepal has, however, said it was not formally informed about the campaign. “We would have made necessary arrangements if we were told beforehand,” said ISPAN President Bhoj Raj Bhat.
The haphazard removal of wires, according to Bhat, has inflicted losses to around 10 ISPs that provide internet service in Thamel area. “We will move the court for causing damage to our assets and demand compensation as well,” said Bhat.

International Astronomical Union, apex body of more than 12,000 professional astronomers around the globe, today a star and its planet of Exoworld Sagarmatha and Laliguras, respectively.
As per the announcement, the star with code HD100777 has been named Sagarmatha (Mt Everest) and the planet with code HD100777b has been named Laliguras (Rhododendron, Nepal’s national flower.) The Exoworld solar system with a single planet lies around 172 light years away from the earth in Leo Constellation of Milky Way Galaxy. One light year is a distance travelled by light in one year. Scientists have claimed planet Laliguras has possibility of ‘habitable zone.’ The names Sagarmatha and Laliguras were selected from the pool of around 476 names suggested by Nepalis living in 11 different countries. The names were recorded from August 1 to August 31.
IAU had authorised Nepal Astronomical Society to undertake the responsibility to collect and suggest top five names each, for the star and the planet. NASO had then formed the Name Exoworld National Committee, which shortlisted top 10 names from around 476 names received.
Names short listed by NAS were Bhrikuti, Kumari, Sagarmatha, Karnali, Tilicho, for the star and Gautam Buddha, Hyatrung, Janak, Laliguras and Manjushree for the planet.
The committee had then called for another voting to choose a name each, for the plant and the star from among the 10 names. Suresh Bhattarai Chairman of the Name Exoworld National Committee said they had collected 19,823 votes from Nepali voters to pick up two names from among the 10.
The IAU’s steering committee and the NENC following multiple rounds of discussions decided to name the star and the planet as Sagarmatha and Laliguras, respectively.
Bhattarai said, “With today’s naming we have secured Nepali names for the heavenly bodies.”
IAU has explained Sagarmatha as ‘Nepali name for the highest peak in the world and symbol of Nepal’s national pride.’ Laligurans has been explained ‘as rhododendron, the national flower of Nepal.’ IAU on the occasion of its 100th anniversary had organised ‘NameExoWorlds’ global competition providing opportunity for 112 countries to name the ‘Exoworld’ discovered by scientists from across the world.
There are more than 4,000 Exoworld bodies discovered by scientists and majority of them have been given scientific code names.

The Ministry of Home Affairs has introduced comprehensive and integrated disaster information management system to strengthen information based disaster risk reduction and response. It provides real time data about hazards and disaster events, affected population and casualty.
With the launch of DIMS at the ministry, provincial and local levels need not develop separate system. All local levels have access to DIMS. They can update and provide disaster related information from the field, which can be directly fed into the system.
According to a report published by the MoHA, DIMS will assist all three tiers of the government in sharing early warning information, risk mapping, warehousing of search and rescue materials and emergency operation and maintaining records of disaster-related incidents. It will help all agencies to coordinate with one another to carry out disaster management activities faster, easier and in more effective manner. DIMS will be used as a common platform for disaster management. MoHA had launched the system after holding discussion with provincial and local levels and other stakeholders. “It serves as repository of data, information, policies and key decisions on disaster risk reduction and management in the country for fostering partnership on disaster management.
It also serves as common system for disaster management at multiple levels of the government and stakeholders,” the report stated.

Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services is set to launch its measles-rubella mass immunisation campaign in two phases. The first phase of the immunisation campaign will kick off on February 13 in Provinces 1, 2 and 5.
The second phase will take place in Province 3, Gandaki, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces from March 14.
FWD expects to immunise 30 lakh children aged between nine months and five years old in its two phased mass immunisation campaign. It said coverage for immunisation would be increased to reduce number of death and disability in children and meet WHO-2023 goal of eliminating measles from the country.

The division said proper co-ordination between officials and local governments was necessary to increase vaccination coverage in children.
It has also requested parents to make sure that their children got full dose of vaccines.
The government has been running 16,000 immunisation centres across the country. “We are extending centres this year as the mass immunisation campaign includes children between nine months and five years of age. Children who missed the second dose of vaccines will also be included in the campaign,” said Bharat Bhandari, immunisation officer at Family Welfare Division.
According to Nepal Demographic Health Survey, percentage of children aged 12 to 23 months old, who received all basic vaccines fell to 78 per cent in 2016 from 87 per cent in 2011.
“Though the first dose of vaccine coverage of measles-rubella is wide, there was less coverage for the second dose of vaccine. It is because people are not aware about the second dose and lack complete knowledge of full dose,” said Bhandari.
Health practitioners have demanded that vaccine supervisors, vaccine officials and cold chain officials be well managed to meet the goal of the immunisation campaign.
The government provides two doses of measles vaccines for children — at nine months and 15 months — from health facilities across the country. Immunisation is the most cost-effective and efficient way to control and eliminate the vaccine-preventable diseases that contribute to childhood illness and death, said Bhandari.
According to World Health Organisation, measles is particularly dangerous for the poor as it attacks malnourished children and those with reduced immunity.
Measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, ear infection and pneumonia while rubella causes irreversible birth defects.

The pedestrian, Leela Devkota (38), who was severely injured, was pronounced dead upon preliminary examinations at the Bansbari based Upendra Devkota Memorial National Institute of Neurological and Allied Sciences. Devkota was walking towards the factory situated across the bridge where she worked when the car hit her.
Prithvi Malla (21) was driving the car under influence. Malla and his friend Karish Maskey were detained by the police who arrived at the scene within a few minutes. Eyewitnesses say there were two other passengers, women, who fled the scene. However, the police refused to comment on the matter.

Deceased Leela Devkota’s last rites were performed at 3:00 pm on December 16.
THT Online talked to Yadav Devkota, deceased Leela Devkota’s brother-in-law, to learn how the family is coping up in the aftermath and what legal actions have been pursued.
The family is naturally devastated, he said, “We have filed a case against the driver responsible for this grave tragedy.”
“We now believe that law will take its course, that the state will ensure justice is done. We trust the state to do its job and won’t resort to protests owing to that trust.”
The Devkota family stands on the hope that the guilty don’t go unpunished backed by legal loopholes or power and influence of perpetrators.
“My brother is a very simple person. He and my deceased sister-in-law were both employed in a pashmina factory and did manual labour. The family’s stand is that it is the children’s right to get compensation and the state’s duty to punish the guilty,” Yadav Devkota shared.
He also expressed his sentiments on Twitter:
“To drive and run a car on a pedestrian while under influence and that without a driver’s licence is not an accident – it’s a murder. The society must take this incident seriously given that there have been incidents of releasing murderers on bail in the past. There should be a constant vigil.”

अपराधीले कारबाही भोगेन भने, परिवारको सदस्य त हामीले गुमायौं, बाँकी समाजले पनि आफ्नो योग्यता गुमाउनेछ । यो केवल 'हाम्रो' मात्रै 'केस' होइन । १५ बर्षे छोरा र उसका दिदीहरुले उचित क्षतिपूर्ति पाउनु उनीहरुको अधिकार हो।अपराधी उपर कारवाही गर्नु राज्यको कर्तव्य हो।यो नै हाम्रो अडान हो।
— Yadab Devkota (@gaunkomanchhey) December 18, 2019

This tweet came in response to some social media posts which came in defence of Prithvi Malla calling this incident a ‘mistake’, asking people to stop talking about it further.
Leela Devkota is survived by her husband and four children – three daughters and a son.
Her husband and three children are currently in mourning while a daughter who is in Japan, was unable to bid her mother a final goodbye.

The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority today arrested two officials of Tripureshwor-based Kathmandu District Office of Guthi Sansthan for allegedly receiving bribe from a service-seeker and returning it to the concerned person later fearing action on graft charge.
Joint Secretary Pradip Kumar Koirala, CIAA spokesperson, said administration Chief Narayan Chaudhary and administration Deputy-chief Jay Prasad Regmi of Guthi Sansthan were taken into custody from their office. The duo had received bribe for maintaining record of plot of Guthi land. Guthi Sansthan has been investigating the disputed land situated in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, after it was found to have been occupied by various persons.

The amount they received in bribe and returned to the concerned service-seeker has not been disclosed. The anti-graft body said inquiry into the case was under way. The CIAA has also filed a graft case against non-gazetted first class officer Narayan Raj Mishra and office assistant Bhaikaji Gautam of Bhaktapur-based Land Reform and Land Revenue Office at the Special Court today.
The duo were recently arrested with bribe amount of Rs 40,000 they received from a service-seeker for adjusting land records of tenants. During investigation, the CIAA had found that Mishra had asked Gautam to receive the bribe on his behalf.
They have been prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act-2002. The CIAA named Gautam as an accomplice for receiving the bribe amount for his boss.

Talks between warring factions of the Nepali Congress made significant headway this evening, with the two sides reaching tentative agreement on issues related to constitution of the Nepal Students Union and extension of tenure of Tarun Dal’s central working committee.
The two sides had yesterday agreed to devise a calendar for the 14th National Convention and present it in the CWC, besides increasing the number of party departments from 28 to 41.
While NC Vice-president Bimalendra Nidhi represented the establishment faction led by NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba, the rival faction led by senior leader Ramchandra Paudel was represented by Prakash Man Singh, Hriday Ram Thani and Dilendra Prasad Badu in the talks. The talks held at Singh’s residence at Chaksibari began at around 5:30pm and lasted for around two hours.
As per the developments so far, Deuba camp will have the leadership in both the NSU and Tarun Dal. In the to-be-formed committees of the sister wings, Deuba and Paudel camps will have representation based on the ratio of their representation in the previous working committees.
Talking to THT, Nidhi said although they did not discuss exact percentage of representation, they would ensure both the sides got respectable shares.
The two sides, however, have yet to reach an agreement on the number of office bearers in the NSU and Tarun Dal. They are discussing prospects of having either one office bearer for one post, or multiple office bearers for single post. “The issue of office bearers in Tarun Dal is almost agreed, but that in the NSU remains to be resolved,” said Nidhi.
The two sides have decided to meet again tomorrow morning at Chaksibari after briefing today’s development to their respective leaderships.
“We, including Sitaula, will meet tomorrow morning at Paudel’s residence, while Nidhi will also brief his group before sitting for a concluding meeting at Chaksibari,” Badu told THT. “Hopefully, we will conclude things in one or two meetings tomorrow before going for the CWC slated for the afternoon.”
Badu, however, said whether they would join tomorrow’s CWC or not would depend on tomorrow morning talks to be held at Chaksibari.
The Paudel camp has been boycotting CWC for the past few days amid differences over the four aforementioned issues. “Since we have already agreed on the number of departments and calendar for the national convention, we hope the remaining issues will conclude tomorrow,” said Badu. “However, we have not yet decided to join the CWC. It will depend on tomorrow morning’s meetings.”
As far as the departments are concerned, it’s still undecided which faction will get leadership of which department.
The Paudel camp has been staking claim on some crucial departments. The issue is also expected to be settled tomorrow morning.
“Things have largely been sorted out. They have agreed to my proposal to conclude everything by tomorrow morning and go for the CWC tomorrow itself even if it’s late,” said Nidhi.
Sitaula also had a meeting with the leaders at Chaksibari earlier in the day. In fact, it was Sitaula who convinced Deuba to postpone the CWC till tomorrow to hold dialogue and move ahead on the basis of consensus. Earlier, the Deuba camp had decided to move ahead on the basis of majority.

Herrera Arteaga Olga, 41, of Bolivia, an alleged suspect associated with a transnational drug racket, was taken into custody from TIA this morning, police said.
A sleuth deployed from NCB intercepted Olga at the arrival terminal of TIA, frisked her baggage and then seized a huge cache of illegal drugs hidden inside a suitcase. And subsequently, police took her under the control.
The consignment of cocaine is said to be worth around Rs 150 million in the international drug market. Police said Olga, who arrived in Nepal on a Fly Dubai flight, intended to smuggle the drug to India.
The Bolivian citizen will be charged under the Narcotic Drugs (Control) Act 1976. It convicted, she can be liable to life imprisonment.
Cocaine is often known as ‘rich person’s drug’ and Nepal is not often considered its market due to its high price. It is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug.

Marathons are gradually evolving as one of Nepal’s fastest-growing group events with the number of participants increasing every year.
Some run without any agenda or a reason while for others, it simply is a way of life. You could be running for a cause or to achieve your personal goal. You might be a newbie or a registered veteran- doesn’t matter if this is the first marathon you’ve endeavoured or the 25th time that you’re taking those lengthy laps. Just try and make sure you make the most of what could be a splendid 42.195-kilometre journey.

Readying yourselves for the run
If you want to enjoy race day and if running a marathon is your goal, you need to plan weeks in advance. “It’s an endurance test, so take appropriate precautions because risk of injury is high and training is tough,” says Alok Khatri, a fitness expert.
Khatri, who coaches performance-centric athletes, believes training for a distance-run may take anywhere from two to four hours every day in the week. He further added, four days of intense training and three days of strength training is vital because it can improve the runner’s performance. Khatri monitors athletes and works on their endurance.
“There is no need to change your food routine because it all depends on your daily activity. However, it is recommended to avoid intense training a week before the marathon,” the fitness expert added.
Khatri believes it is very important to taper for a marathon a week before the event. “Once you’re in shape to run a marathon, spend your last week stretching, work on your core.”
People experience various aches and pains while training for marathons. “To keep this in check, steady pace should be kept and Rated Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale should be monitored to measure the intensity of the exercise where one should never go over six on a scale of 1-10. Even high-level athletes maintain this pace,” said Khatri. Fitness trainers try and maintain the pace of an athlete to make sure they are determined during a race to reach the starting point.
To avoid injuries, runners should pick their running gear wisely, learn to time themselves, get into comfortable clothes, manage their speed, and control their breathing. “If you invest in a pair of good shoes and your training is on point, you’re good to go.”
“Running longer distance without proper gear may result in injury because of limited movement and can lead to plantar fasciitis, a tissue inflammation at the bottom of one’s foot that runs from the heel to toes,” Khatri concluded.
More on the marathon: Management and Participation
The marathon will have six categories — full marathon (42.195 km), half marathon (21.098 km), wheelchair marathon (3 km), school marathon (5 km), corporate relay (42 km), and family-run (3 km). The family-run category was added to the marathon bandwagon this year with an aim to bring families together in a sports event.
The upcoming edition of the marathon will begin at Tripureshwar and end at Dashrath Stadium, passing all three districts — Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur.
During the recently concluded 13th South Asian Games (SAG) held in Nepal, Kiran Singh Bogati won the gold medal in men’s marathon by finishing the race in 2:21:07. Likewise, Pushpa Bhandari became the first Nepali female athlete to bag a marathon medal, a silver, by finishing the race in 2:50:11.
“Over the years, the number of participants has been increasing,” said Bagmati Rai, executive director of Prosports, the company which organises the event.
Organisers say that about 500 volunteers will be mobilised along the route and traffic police officers will also be stationed for support. Around 15 water stations will be installed along the route.
Rai, sharing her woes, said she had a hard time making the government officials understand how a marathon and a race are two absolutely different events.
In a country like Nepal, organising a marathon calls for a lot of planning and management, which is not possible without government support. Rai shares that she had even requested the government to take ownership of the event. “A lot of private organisations, however, are supporting the Kathmandu Marathon.”
Marathons are also becoming more popular among non-Nepali runners. 150 foreign nationals are expected to register for the upcoming run, said Rai. Japanese national Kazuaki Naganuma, a veteran runner who is no stranger to Kathmandu Marathon, is participating for the fourth time in this event.
Naganuma, in very fluent Nepali, said, “I love Nepal and have many friends here.” The 60-year-old runner has trained many athletes from 1984 to 1986 including legendary marathon runner Baikuntha Manandhar.
“When you complete a marathon, there is a sense of achievement, and the race becomes beautiful where you compete with yourself,” said Siddharth Rawat, an Indian merchant navy officer and longtime distance runner who has participated in marathons in different parts of the world.
Marathon, for Rawat, is a way to get back into the running routine that he stopped long back due to unavoidable circumstances. “I am passionate about running and every time I go out for a run I remind myself of an ultimate goal – to hit that finish line on a marathon day. I run for the love of the finish line.”
Rawat, whose best timing so far has been one-and-a-half hours for a 21-km run, believes running is the best form of meditation and there is no workout quite like a good hard run. “You are your own judge, so know your limitations as running gets you more disciplined and focused,” added Rawat. “I run with no fear. I feel like if I make it here, I can make it anywhere.”
A four-time marathon runner in Kathmandu, Rawat believes that the marathon fee should be increased in order to avail more facilities as well as ensure safety. He says that the more fee you pay, the more facilities you will get. Contradictory to this, others are of the opinion that hefty fees (Rs.1000) would discourage some from participating in the event.
Speaking about the event, General Secretary of Nepal Olympic Committee and a chief organiser of Kathmandu Marathon Nilendra Raj Shrestha said that he worries traffic management might be a challenge and is requesting the concerned authorities that traffic be brought to a halt for two to three hours during the event. There have already been 6,000 registrations and organisers are expecting a minimum of 10,000 participants, he concluded.
Run Kathmandu, Run!
Kathmandu, now if you are inspired to run, go hit the roads on the marathon day (which is on December 21, in case you forgot) on a what could be a very-very ‘Kathmandu-winter-morning’ where a mass participation will be witnessed.
Train hard, take precautions, eat healthy, follow the advice of the experts and when you cross that finish line- remember to celebrate, and don’t stop there…

Kathmandu, December 16
Minister of Health and Population Bhanubhakta Dhakal has said the irregularities and anomalies in government hospitals will be brought to zero soon.
Speaking at an event organised in the capital to mark the sixth anniversary of National Trauma Centre, Minister Dhakal said government hospitals should be made centres of attraction for patients. “ “Irregularities and anomalies prevalent in the hospitals will be gradually controlled and brought to zero. Government hospitals should ensure reliable service,” said Dhakal.
Soon after assuming the post of health minister, Dhakal started taking stock of government hospitals.
He said that complaints had been received against doctors and nurses for not providing proper health services to patients. “We are working on a plan to bring uniformity in the services provided by doctors and nurses in all government hospitals,” Minister Dhakal said.
National Trauma Centre, which was established six years ago, has been providing health services to people suffering from various kinds of injuries such as head, lumbar, spine and pelvis injuries, shoulder and upper arm, elbow and forearm, and plastic surgery, among various other services.
A total of 79,239 people visited the centre’s out-door patient department while 18,263 people visited the emergency ward in the last fiscal.

The magnitude 6.1 quake was centred in mountainous Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan, at a depth of 210 km (130 miles), the US Geological Survey said.
Officials in Kabul said they were assessing damage in areas around the sparsely populated epicentre. In Pakistan, tremors shook furniture and power cable poles. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Waseem Ahmad, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority in Islamabad, estimated the quake to be about 6.4 magnitude.
“I was with my kids at a badminton court when we felt strong jolts,” said Nusrat Jabeen in Pakistan‘s capital. “It was very scary. We felt everything was shaking. We ran out for safety.”
Tremors were also felt in India’s mountainous Kashmir state where people rushed out of their homes and offices. The Indian subcontinent has suffered some of the largest earthquakes in the world.

KATHMANDU: Veteran climbers of Mount Everest are skeptical that proposed new regulations by the Nepalese government to tighten the permit process for adventurers will address the root causes of this year’s heavy death toll on the world’s tallest peak.
American mountaineers Ed Viesturs and Alan Arnette said planned new laws – if they are introduced at all – are unlikely to tackle the growing trend of inexperienced climbers rushing in packs to scale the 29,035-foot (8,850-metre) Himalayan peak.
“I’ve seen this movie so many times it’s totally predictable,” Arnette told Reuters in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “Every year since 2013, something goes wrong and they (the Nepal government) announce all these new rules and never implement them.”
Eleven climbers died on Mount Everest this year – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side. Many perished when a rush to climb the mountain during a short window of suitable weather in late May led to a “traffic jam” near the summit.
“Most teams opt to go for the summit when the first weather window is predicted,” Viesturs told Reuters in one of a series of interviews by phone and email.
“Everyone is afraid of missing what might be the one and only perfect day. There are typically several good summit days, but there’s pressure to go when everyone else goes.”
Nepal has traditionally issued climbing permits to anyone prepared to pay the $11,000 fee, handing out a record 381 passes this year. With essential Sherpas and guides added, more than 800 people were trying to reach the summit during the short weather window.
TRAFFIC JAM IN THE DEATH ZONE
The overcrowding – which caught worldwide attention when a photograph of a queue of climbers stepping over bodies to reach the summit went viral – caused fatal delays in the thin air in what is known as the “death zone” above 8,000 metres. That raised concerns that inexperienced mountaineers were being encouraged to attempt the climb by unscrupulous guide companies.
Among the changes proposed by the Nepalese government is a requirement for climbers to submit a medical report by a certified doctor disclosing their history and state of health. Another suggested requirement was the climbers submit proof they had scaled another 6,500-metre peak in Nepal.
Arnette said the first change was unlikely to be enough, given the potential to forge medical documents, while the second made little sense as many climbers have scaled higher peaks elsewhere.
The recommendations have been submitted to the cabinet for approval, Mira Acharya, who oversees climbing activities for the Nepal government’s Department of Tourism, told Reuters last week. The government has not given a time frame for the introduction of new laws.
Viesturs, who has an extensive history on Everest, said the proposed changes did not do enough to tackle the “group think” pack mentality that led to the traffic jam in late May, a problem he said also needed to be addressed by climb leaders at base camp.
“I know several climbers who waited until later and had the mountain almost to themselves,” Viesturs said of this year’s climbing season. “We really need to answer why so many people are on the summit ridge on the same day? How can you control it?”

158,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/charity-sues-kenya-over-treatment-of-trafficked-indian-nepali-women/,"NAIROBI: A charity said on Monday it is suing the Kenyan government over a failure to provide five women trafficked from India and Nepal for sexual exploitation with appropriate care after they were rescued.
HAART Kenya said a decision to make the three Nepali and two Indian women rescued from a Nairobi bar in August stay and testify against their alleged traffickers had caused them psychological harm.
“After four months, the victims just want to go home. They have become deeply traumatised and suicidal … some have been hospitalised,” said Sophie Otiende, programme consultant for HAART Kenya, which has rented a safe house for the victims.
“So we have filed a complaint against the government so that all victims of trafficking are not compelled to testify, and the government pays for their speedy and safe repatriation.”
The government has said it hopes to repatriate the five women, aged in their early to mid-twenties, in the coming days.
The petition, due to be heard on Tuesday, states that Kenya’s attorney general, inspector general of police and director of public prosecutions violated an anti-trafficking law that says victims have a right to privacy and safe repatriation.
It also calls on authorities to pay expenses of more than 1.3 million Kenyan shillings ($12,830) incurred by the charity for the care of the victims, which the law says is the state’s responsibility.
Kenyan government officials denied a lack of care and said no request for funds had been received.
“We have received requests from other charities which are being considered. If HAART approached us, we would of course consider providing funds for these victims,” said Elizabeth Mbuka, Head of the Counter Trafficking in Persons Secretariat.
Mbuka said a court order for the repatriation of the five women had now been given.
BOLLYWOOD BARS
A rising number of women and girls are leaving South Asian nations such as Nepal, India and Pakistan to work in Bollywood-style dance bars in Kenya’s adult entertainment industry – many illegally – according to anti-trafficking activists and police.
There is no official data, but the results of police raids combined with figures on repatriation of rescued women suggest scores of women and underage girls are victims of organised human trafficking from South Asia to Kenya.
Common in India, so-called mujra dance bars – where young women dance to Bollywood music for money from male patrons – have mushroomed in cities including Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, where large numbers of Kenyans of South Asian descent live.
Police and anti-trafficking groups have repeatedly voiced concerns that some of these private clubs are used as a front to ensnare women and girls, some in sex slavery, with women forced to pay off loans by erotic dancing or having sex with clients.
An official from the Indian High Commission in Nairobi said there had been “a few” cases involving the trafficking of Indian women to Kenyan dance bars.
“Whenever there is a case, we request consular access and provide whatever support we can to the victims,” said the official, who did not want to be named.
“We try to ensure that all Indian nationals go back as soon as possible, but we can only do this when the court orders this in the host country.”

TIRANA/THUMANE: At least 13 people were killed when the most powerful earthquake to hit Albania in decades shook the capital Tirana and the country’s west and north on Tuesday, tearing down buildings and burying residents under rubble.
Residents, some carrying babies, fled apartment buildings in Tirana and the western port of Durres after the 6.4 magnitude quake struck shortly before 4 a.m. (0300 GMT).
In the northern town of Thumane, Marjana Gjoka, 48, was sleeping in her apartment on the fourth floor of a five-storey building when the quake shattered the top floors.
“The roof collapsed on our head and I don’t know how we escaped. God helped us,” said Gjoka, whose three-year-old niece was among four people in the apartment when the quake struck.
The quake was centred 30 km (19 miles) west of Tirana, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said, and was also felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia.
Hours later a magnitude 5.4 earthquake hit Bosnia, with an epicentre 75 km (45 miles) south of Sarajevo, monitors said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
Five people were found dead in the rubble of apartment buildings in the northern Albanian town of Thumane and a man died in the town of Kurbin after jumping out of a building, a Defence Ministry spokeswoman said.
Seven bodies were pulled from collapsed buildings in Durres, the main port and tourism destination, the Defence Ministry said, adding 39 had been pulled out alive from under the ruins.
Defence Minister Olta Xhacka said 135 people were injured.
Firefighters, police and civilians were removing the debris from collapsed buildings in Thumane. Most of the buildings that collapsed were built of bricks, a Reuters reporter said.
Rescuers in Thumane used a mechanical digger to claw at collapsed masonry and remove a tangle of metal and cables. Others groped with bare hands to clear rubble.
Two people were pulled from rubble in Thumane four hours after the quake, a Reuters reporter said. Doctors said they were in a bad condition.
“Everything at home kept falling down,” Refik, a Tirana resident, said of the impact on his sixth-floor apartment.
“We were awake because of the previous quakes, but the last one shook us around,” he told Reuters, referring to smaller tremors recorded in the hour before the main quake.
Rescuers told local media one of the dead was an elderly woman who saved her grandson by cradling him with her body.
TRAPPED
Xhacka said the quake’s epicentre was in Durres. It was followed by 100 aftershocks.
“Durres and Thumane are the areas worst hit. Rescue-and-save work continues in the collapsed buildings there,” she said as troops pulled a victim from a hotel in Durres.
At least 135 people were injured, with 72 hospitalized, Xhacka said. Two planes from fellow NATO-member Romania were expected to land with specialized search and rescue equipment and help was coming from Italy and Turkey, Xhacka said.
Greece had sent emergency services for search and rescue operations, its premier’s office said.
“Firefighters and army staff are helping residents under the rubble”, in Durres and Thumane, the Defence Ministry said.
An unidentified man, with a wound dressing on his right cheek, told News24 TV his daughter and niece were among those trapped in a collapsed apartment building in Durres.
“I talked with my daughter and niece on the phone. They said they are well and are waiting for the rescue. Could not talk to my wife. There are other families, but I could not talk to them,” the man said.
Located along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, between Greece and Macedonia, Albania experiences regular seismic activity.
An earthquake of 5.6 magnitude shook the country on Sept. 21, damaging around 500 houses and destroying some. The Defence Ministry had said it was the most powerful quake in Albania in the last 30 years.
The images of collapsed buildings in urban areas suggested Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than one in 1979 which razed a neighbourhood of a northern town. Neither of those two earlier earthquakes caused fatalities.
The Balkan nation is the poorest country in Europe, with an average income of less than a third of the European Union average, according to Eurostat data.

SYDNEY: Firefighters battled hundreds of bushfires across Australia on Thursday as scores of blazes sprang up in new locations, triggering warnings that it was too late for some residents to evacuate.
As Thick smoke blanketed the most populous city of Sydney for a third day, residents were urged to keep children indoors, stepping up pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to tackle climate change.
By early afternoon, dozens of fires were burning across the southeastern state of Victoria and temperatures of 40.9 Celsius (105.6 F) in Melbourne, its capital, matched the hottest day on record in 1894, Australia‘s weather bureau said.
Authorities warned residents of towns about 50 km (31 miles) north of Ballarat, the state’s third largest city, that it was too late for them to evacuate safely.
“You are in danger, act now to protect yourself,” fire authorities said in an alert. “It is too late to leave. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately.”
Blazes across several states have endangered thousands of people, killing at least four people this month, burning about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroying more than 400 homes.
The early arrival and severity of the fires in the southern hemisphere spring follows three years of drought that experts have linked to climate change and which have left bushland tinder-dry.
With 10 days remaining to the official start of summer, extreme temperatures and high winds have sparked wildfires in new areas, even as firefighters tracked the crisis across the mainland, the Northern Territory and the island of Tasmania.
In Victoria, power to more than 100,000 homes was knocked out amid lightning strikes and strong, gusty winds of more than 110 kph (68 mph) that knocked tree branches into power lines, ahead of a cool change expected to bring relief in the evening.
The extensive damage was likely to leave some customers without power through the night as utilities worked to restore networks and fix downed powerlines, a spokeswoman for power provider Ausnet said.
State authorities issued its first Code Red alert in a decade, signifying the worst possible bushfire conditions, warning that should a fire start it would be fast moving, unpredictable and probably uncontrollable.
In the state of New South Wales, strong winds blew smoke from 60 fires still burning over much of Sydney, shrouding the harbour city and its famous landmarks in thick smog.
The state imposed tough new water curbs in Sydney from Dec. 10, when a key dam is expected to be down to 45% capacity. Residents face fines if they use hoses to water their gardens and wash their cars.
CLIMATE POLITICS
The unrelenting conditions have sharpened attention on the climate change policies of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who rejected any link.
“Climate change is a global phenomenon, and we’re doing our bit as part of the response to climate change,” Morrison told ABC radio.
“To suggest that, with just 1.3% of global emissions, that Australia doing something differently – more or less – would have changed the fire outcome this season, I don’t think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all.”
Morrison’s conservative government has committed to the Paris Agreement for a cut in emissions from 26% to 28% by 2030, versus 2005 levels. Critics say current projections suggest it will miss that target and have urged remedial steps.

161,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/singapore-court-to-hear-legal-challenges-on-gay-sex-ban/,"KUALA LUMPUR: As a Singapore court prepares to hear a series of legal challenges to a law that bans gay sex, LGBT+ activists on Tuesday called for the “right” verdict to be delivered so similar reforms can be triggered across other parts of Asia.
Like many other former British colonies, Singapore has retained an old law that criminalises gay sex, which was scrapped by India in a landmark court ruling last year to give a boost to LGBT+ rights.
Empowered by the Indian ruling, three Singaporean activists have launched separate bids in a renewed push to decriminalise gay sex in the city-state, where a high court is due to begin hearing their cases on Wednesday.
“I think public opinion is pretty clear across religious and age segments that homosexuality should not be a criminal offence,” Johnson Ong Ming, who was among the trio, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Ong, a DJ also known as DJ Big Kid, was the first to launch the case in September last year. The former head of a LGBT+ rights charity and a retired doctor also filed similar lawsuits later.
“I have full confidence in our judicial system and I am hopeful that the court will come to the right decision … and overturn Section 377A,” Ong said by email.
The court has set aside six days in November for the legal challenges to be heard but it is unclear when the proceedings will wrap up.
Under Section 377A of Singapore’s Penal Code, a man found to have committed an act of “gross indecency” with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare. The law does not apply to homosexual acts between women.
Singapore has emerged as a modern nation since independence six decades ago but socially it remains conservative, partly due to sensitivities stemming from multi-religious groups among its 5.6 million population.
Previous legal challenges to overturn the ban have failed, although recent opinion polls indicated there has been growing support for gay rights.
Opposition to gay marriage had fallen to 60%, down from 74% in 2013, according to a poll of more than 4,000 people published in May by the Institute of Policy Studies, a Singapore think-tank.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong however has previously said that Singapore society “is not that liberal on these matters”.
The Singapore court cases are being closely watched by LGBT+ groups in some other parts of Asia that have maintained the colonial-era law, including in Myanmar and Malaysia.
“If the decision in Singapore goes our way, then it will boost our morale here in Malaysia,” said Numan Afifi, president of the LGBT+ advocacy Pelangi Campaign in Malaysia.
Aung Myo Min, executive director from the Yangon-based Equality Myanmar LGBT+ campaign group said both Singapore and Myanmar “should follow the example of India” and repeal the archaic law.
Gay sex is a crime in both countries, with those convicted facing sentences of up to 10 years in jail in Myanmar and 20 years in Malaysia.

162,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/at-least-40-killed-as-fresh-protests-engulf-iraq-3/,"BAGHDAD: At least 40 protesters were killed in Iraq on Friday when security forces used tear gas and an Iranian-backed militia opened fire to try to quell renewed demonstrations against corruption and economic hardship, security sources said.

A government intelligence officer and a member of the powerful Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia were killed in a clash with protesters in the southern city of Amara, police sources said.
More than 2,000 people were injured nationwide, according to medical sources and the Iraqi High Commission on Human Rights (IHCHR), as demonstrators vented frustration at political elites they say have failed to improve their lives after years of conflict.
“All we want are four things: jobs, water, electricity, and safety. That’s all we want,” said 16-year-old Ali Mohammed who had covered his face with a T-shirt to avoid inhaling tear gas, as chaotic scenes overwhelmed Baghdad‘s central Tahrir Square.
Sirens wailed and tear gas canisters landed amid groups of young protesters draped in Iraqi flags and chanting “with life and blood we defend you Iraq.”
The bloodshed is the second major bout of violence this month. A series of clashes two weeks ago between protesters and security forces left 157 people dead and over 6,000 wounded.
The unrest has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which lived through foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State (IS) insurgency between 2003 and 2017. It is the biggest challenge to security since IS was declared beaten.
On Friday, eight protesters were killed in Baghdad, the IHCHR said. At least five of them were protesters struck by tear gas canisters, security sources said.
In the south, at least nine protesters were killed when members of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) militia opened fire on protesters who tried to set fire to the group’s office in the city of Nasiriya, according to security sources.
Eight people were killed in Amara city, including six protesters, one AAH member and one intelligence officer, police sources said. Three protesters were killed in oil-rich Basra, one in Hilla, and one in Samawa, security sources said.
In Diwaniya city, twelve protesters died after being trapped in a burning building, morgue officials and police sources said.
The building, which housed the local offices of the Iran-backed Badr Organisation, was apparently torched by protesters unaware that others were already inside.
Interior Ministry spokesman Khalid al-Muhanna said at least 68 members of the security forces were injured.
The sometimes violent demonstrations erupted in Baghdad on October 1 and spread to southern cities.
They pose the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi since he took office just a year ago. Despite promising reforms and ordering a broad cabinet reshuffle, he has so far struggled to address the protesters’ discontent.
POVERTY, DESPITE OIL WEALTH
Despite the OPEC member country’s vast oil wealth, many Iraqis live in poverty, have limited access to clean water, electricity, basic healthcare or decent education as the country tries to recover from years of conflict and economic hardship.
Many Iraqis view the elite as subservient to one or other of Iraq’s two main allies, the United States and Iran. Many suspect these powers use Iraq to pursue their struggle for regional influence via proxies unconcerned with ordinary people’s needs.
“They hit us last night and again this morning. We don’t have any demands anymore, we want the government toppled,” said demonstrator Salah Mohammad.
“We want Iran to take its parties and leave, America to take its parties and leave, and let the Iraqi people decide.”
In Basra, Reuters footage showed protesters clashing with security forces who launched tear gas canisters and stun grenades and were met by rocks thrown at their vehicles. Young men carried the injured away, as protesters set police cars on fire.
An 8 pm curfew was imposed until further notice in the southern provinces of Basra, Muthanna, Wasit, Babel and Dhi Qar, after protesters torched offices of lawmakers, Shi’ite political parties and militia headquarters.
How the government and security forces handled Friday’s planned protests had been seen as a litmus test for the stability of the country with political leaders already on edge.
RAGE AGAINST THE ELITE
In a Thursday night address, Abdul Mahdi stressed that violence would not be tolerated and warned that any collapse of the government would drag Iraq into further turmoil.
Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who in recent weeks criticised the government’s handling of the protests, urged calm on all sides during his sermon on Friday.
In Baghdad, many demonstrators initially believed authorities would refrain from violence after security forces killed dozens of protesters earlier this month.
Hundreds tried throughout the day to march into the city’s fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies, when they were stopped by security forces.
By afternoon, the mood had shifted with thousands of angry protesters wrapped in Iraqi flags under pouring rain, chanting that they were peaceful and calling political leaders corrupt.
As clashes broke out, tuk-tuks carried the injured to hospitals. Medical sources told Reuters hundreds of people had been treated for injuries, most related to tear gas exposure.

163,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/indian-muslims-anxious-as-court-prepares-to-rule-on-destroyed-mosque/,"
AYODHYA: In the Indian town of Ayodhya, minority Muslims are feeling under siege as they await a Supreme Court ruling on a centuries-old religious dispute that has cast a shadow over their relations with the majority Hindu community.
After a tangle of legal cases, the Supreme Court in August decided to hear arguments every day in an effort to resolve the dispute over what should be built on the ruins of the 16th-century Babri Masjid, destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992.
The uproar over the mosque triggered some of India‘s deadliest riots, in which nearly 2,000 people, most of them Muslim, were killed.
The bloody controversy raised lingering questions about the role of religion in the officially secular country, and the place of Muslims in it.
Last month, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi finished the hearings and is expected to pronounce his verdict in the next couple of weeks.
Whichever way it goes, the decision is likely to have a significant impact on the fraught relationship between India‘s Hindus and Muslims, who constitute 14% of its 1.3 billion people.
While most Muslim religious leaders want the mosque to be rebuilt, Hindus say there is evidence there was a temple on the site before the mosque was built in 1528 by a commander of Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty.
Construction of a “grand temple” in Ayodhya has long been an election promise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won a second term with a landslide this year.
Fearing tension after the court decision, Mohammed Shahid, 48, the grandson of the mosque’s last Imam, or prayer leader, has decided to move his family away.
He has reason to be afraid.
Shahid’s father, Mohammed Shabir, was killed by a mob of Hindus who rampaged through Ayodhya before tearing down the mosque on Dec. 6, 1992.
“In 1992, we decided to stay put – a decision that we live to regret,” Shahid said, sitting in the courtyard of his run-down, two-storied house.
“Other than killing my father, they set ablaze our house and a sawmill, our only source of income.”
‘BAD ELEMENTS’
Shahid said he was glad that his grandfather, who had died in 1990, did not see the destruction of the mosque.
Unlike Shahid, Haji Mahboob Ahmad, a 66-year-old Muslim community leader who lives near the site, doesn’t plan to leave.
But he shares Shahid’s anxiety.
“We’re conscious of the fact that some bad elements can try to foment trouble by taking advantage of the situation and that’s why I’ve requested authorities to ensure the safety of Ayodhya’s Muslims,” Ahmad said.
Ahmad said India‘s founding fathers established it as a secular democracy, and it must remain that.
The day Shahid’s father was killed, Hindu Hajari Lal, 57, escaped death.
Lal was among the hundreds of Hindus who destroyed the mosque with shovels, hammers and their bare hands, bringing down its domes before the whole structure collapsed.
Unfortunately for Lal, part of the building fell on him, trapping him in the rubble with broken bones.
“Since that fateful day of 1992, the only objective of my life is to see a permanent temple on the site. I can die in peace if I get to see the temple,” Lal said.
‘ENDLESSLY WAITING’
For Hindus, Lal said, the site in Ayodhya was as sacred as Mecca is in Islam.
That’s because Lal and millions of other Hindus believe the mosque was built at the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities.
Lal helps to guide a steady stream of pilgrims who come to see a model of what they hope will become a new temple.
Visitors can also look at an open field of masonry, in pink sandstone, including piles of ornately carved columns. Concrete pillars and blocks for foundations are also ready.
“Once the court green-lights construction of the temple, we can quickly move these concrete blocks from the workshop to the temple site,” said Sharad Sharma, spokesman for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council.
Top politicians, including some cabinet ministers, regularly visit Ayodhya to pay their respect to Nritya Gopal Das, an influential monk and chairman of a trust committed to building the temple.
“I’m sure Modi ji is aware of the sentiments of millions of Hindus who have been endlessly waiting to see the Ram temple,” said Das, using an honorific for Modi.

Canada named top country for social entrepreneurs
United States suffers biggest fall amid political uncertainty
More youth interest in working for businesses that do good



LONDON: Canada was named the best country for business leaders seeking to tackle social problems in a global poll on Tuesday while the United States fell from top slot due to political uncertainty.
Australia came second in the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s second global survey on the best countries for social entrepreneurs, seeing the biggest gain of 24 places from the inaugural poll in 2016, while France came third.
Mexico came last, down 15 places from 2016, but the United States was the biggest loser, plunging to 32nd place from No. 1, with the poll of about 900 social enterprise experts pointing to difficulties with government policy and access to investment.
Francois Bonnici, head of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, said over the past three years there had been “some amazing gains and some ongoing challenges” for social entrepreneurs addressing issues from climate change to refugees.
“Governments are recognising that to meet their own agendas this is a group of citizens and entrepreneurs that actually want to improve society and the environment,” said Bonnici.
“But it has a slightly different flavour in each country and that government role is important (as it) can legitimise the sector in their country by creating these policies.”
Business entrepreneurs globally are increasingly setting their sights on social problems with ventures that can be a commercial success while addressing problems like unemployment, homelessness, mental health, knife crime and even loneliness.
For example in South Africa social enterprise Harambee has created a ‘dating service’ to match unemployed youth with employers, while in India Project Patradya is tackling the waste problem by employing Afghan refugee women to make edible bowls.
But with little data on which nations were encouraging the sector, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in partnership with Deutsche Bank, began a poll in 2016 which was repeated in 2019. Social entrepreneurs, academics, investors and support agencies in the world’s 45 biggest economies, as ranked by the World Bank, were asked their views. Iran and Saudi Arabia were dropped in 2019 as it was impossible to get the right sample.
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
The 2019 poll found most experts, 82%, said social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum in their countries – although this was down three percentage points from 2016.
Canada, Indonesia and South Africa were named as the top countries where social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum, while Mexico, the United States and China saw the biggest falls.
Despite this, more than half of respondents – 54% – said the public still did not understand what they did which was not helped by the lack of a global definition of social enterprise. Italians were most aware of their work and Poles the least.
“People are becoming aware that the whole notion of social entrepreneurship is not just kumbaya,” said former Bangladeshi-U.S. investment banker Durreen Shahnaz, founder of the first social stock exchange, Impact Investment Exchange (IIX).
“It really is about doing serious work and making sure that work is scalable … There are signs the industry is maturing.”
The rising interest of young people – under the age of 25 – was a new finding, with three in four experts saying more young people were interested in working in social enterprises.
Indonesian social entrepreneur Denica Flesch wanted a career where she had a direct impact in the fight against poverty so in 2016, aged 26, she founded SukkhaCitta, an online marketplace selling clothes made by female artisans in Indonesian villages. “Young people are really challenging the notion of work, and combining purpose and career in one place,” said Flesch.
“They’re more idealistic and want to do something that’s beyond just looking for money.”
Canada was named as the top country where young people were playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs, followed by Germany and France, as well as the top place for women leaders.
WOMEN TAKING A LEAD
“Culturally we are about diversity and inclusion at a national level. That’s our brand, so that is helpful for the environment for social enterprise,” said Marcia Nozick, founder and chief executive of Vancouver-based social enterprise EMBERS.
She said policies that encouraged governments to buy the services of social impact ventures had been vital in helping the growth of EMBERS, which finds flexible jobs for people in a deprived part of Vancouver.
Nozick said there were many female leaders because it was “about caring and relationships and that has always been at the forefront of what women have brought to the business sector”.
Women were also seen as playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs in Australia, Belgium, Sweden and Malaysia.
The United States was named the worst place for female social entrepreneurs – the same as in 2016 – while Argentina and China slumped the most in questions regarding women in the poll conducted online and by telephone between May 7 and July 30.
The biggest falls for the United States overall related to access to investment, selling to businesses and supportive government policy.
Attracting investment continued to be a challenge, according to 56% of experts, down two percentage points from 2016.
Bonnie Chiu, founder and chief executive of Lensational, a social enterprise that trains marginalised women as photographers, said there was more capital available to social entrepreneurs but they had to jump through hoops to get it.
“So much time is spent chasing these opportunities,” said Chiu, whose business is based in Britain and Hong Kong.
“Traditional businesses just need to prove that they are financially sound, traditional charities just need to prove that they are generating social impact – but social enterprises need to do both.”
But regardless of the problems getting political support, financing or selling to businesses, experts said there would always be a need for social entrepreneurs to address the world’s largest problems where markets or public policy had failed.
“The more our political leaders might struggle to solve the world’s most pressing problems, the more opportunity for social entrepreneurs to come up with solutions,” said Jude O’Reilly, a senior director at U.S. nonprofit the Skoll Foundation.

OTTAWA: Canadians began voting on Monday to determine whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept into office four years ago as a charismatic figure promising “sunny ways,” will remain in power after two major scandals.
Polls opened in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland, with voting set to end in the Pacific Coast province of British Columbia at 7 p.m. (0200 GMT on Tuesday).
Trudeau, 47, the Liberal Party leader, was endorsed by former Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama in the final stretch of the campaign and is viewed as one of the last remaining progressive leaders among the world’s major democracies.
But he was shaken during the campaign by a blackface scandal and has been dogged by criticism of his handling of a corruption case involving a major Canadian construction company. Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has also had to overcome a sense of fatigue with his government.
Trudeau, accompanied by his wife and three children, voted in Montreal on Monday after a marathon sprint campaigning across the country in the past four days.
His Liberals and the main opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer are in a neck-and-neck race, according to opinion polls.
“The truth is it’s a coin toss right now,” said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker.
A year ago, no one would have predicted that Trudeau risked being the first prime minister since the 1930s to secure a parliamentary majority and then fail to win a second term.
The latest opinion polls suggest he may narrowly avert that result and could return to office with a minority in the 338-seat House of Commons. That would still leave Trudeau in a weakened position and needing the support of left-leaning opposition parties to push through key pieces of legislation.
The Canadian dollar was trading at a new three-month high on Monday, where “domestic attention is squarely on the 43rd federal election today,” said Shaun Osborne, chief market strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
“After some noise around the vote, we think FX players will refocus attention on the Bank of Canada policy outlook, the Fed and international backdrop pretty quickly,” he said.
Despite Scheer’s dimpled smile, Trudeau’s main rival has proven to be a determined opponent.
“He can’t even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he’s always wearing a mask,” Scheer said during a debate. “Mr. Trudeau, you are a phony and you are a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country.”
In his bid to unseat Trudeau, Scheer is also promising to balance the federal budget and eliminate a “carbon tax” on fossil fuels. Scheer, 40, is running his first campaign as party leader after winning a bitter Conservative leadership fight in 2017.
BUMPY CAMPAIGN RIDE
The six-week official campaign period has been a rough and meandering ride with dirty tactics on both sides.
The liberal image of Trudeau, who has championed diversity as prime minister and whose father opened up the country to mass immigration, took a severe blow when pictures emerged early in the campaign of him wearing blackface in the early 1990s and in 2001.
Trudeau had already been wrestling with the fallout from accusations he pressured his justice minister to help shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc from corruption charges. In August, a top watchdog said Trudeau breached ethics rules.
Given the fact that neither of the front-runners could come away with a parliamentary majority, it is the smaller left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) or the separatist Bloc Quebecois that could end up holding the balance of power.
“I am a lifelong Liberal voter and I am stumped on this one, mostly because I am really concerned about a Conservative win and just trying to figure out how to vote strategically,” said Kristin Street, 33, a strategy manager at a computer games company, in Port Moody, British Columbia.
EKOS Research pollster Frank Graves said Liberals needed turnout to be similar to four years ago or otherwise the Conservatives may have an edge.
“We may well be waiting until the final vote tallies in British Columbia to see who will win on Monday,” Graves said.

166,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/indonesia-says-over-11500-have-fled-violence-hit-papuan-town/,"
JAKARTA: Indonesian authorities said on Thursday more than 11,500 people have been evacuated from the town of Wamena in the easternmost province of Papua since dozens died during clashes last month in the area.
Located on the western half of the island of New Guinea and long racked by a simmering separatist insurgency, Papua encompasses Indonesia’s two easternmost provinces and has a distinct ethnic Melanesian population.
There has been a spike in protests and unrest since late August after Papuan students in Surabaya, Indonesia’s second city on the island of Java, were taunted and attacked by a mob chanting racial epithets over accusations they had desecrated a national flag.
In some of the worst bloodshed in decades in Papua, 33 people died and scores were hurt during clashes in Wamena on Sept. 23.
Government offices and homes were burned down, and 250 cars and motorcycles destroyed, as indigenous Papuans and security forces clashed.
The government and some Papuan independence activists say 25 of the 33 who died there were migrants from elsewhere in the country.
Erizal, 42, a former resident of Wamena who had left, said his child and wife died during the unrest and he now felt too traumatised to consider returning to the town.
“I am in my village in Padang now, maybe I will not return back to Wamena,” he said by telephone from the Padang area on Sumatra island where he was originally from.
He said his shop had also been burnt down in the unrest.
Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 2 Indonesia‘s air force had flown 7,467 people out of Wamena on Hercules planes, while 4,179 people had left on commercial flights, said Harry Hikmat, an official at Indonesia‘s social ministry.
Ahmad Musthofa Kamal, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said the situation in Wamane was now stable and that shops and markets were open again.
A former Dutch colony, Papua was formally incorporated into Indonesia in 1969, after a disputed vote of about 1,025 hand-picked tribal leaders. The result of the plebiscite was overseen and endorsed by the United Nations.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has opened the door to holding talks with separatists in Papua, a departure from the stance of previous governments and some of his cabinet ministers.

167,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/hong-kong-police-fire-rubber-bullets-tear-gas-as-clashes-intensify/,"
HONG KONG: Hong Kong police fired water cannon, rubber bullets and round after round of tear gas at petrol-bomb and brick-throwing protesters on Sunday in some of the most widespread violence in more than three months of anti-government unrest.
Running battles in the Causeway Bay shopping district, Wan Chai bar area and the Admiralty district of central government offices followed a night of showdowns with police in the Chinese-ruled city after a peaceful pro-democracy rally turned ugly on the streets outside.
More protests are planned in the run-up to China’s Oct. 1 National Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.
Police also fired tear gas from the roof of the Legislative Council building, which activists trashed and daubed with graffiti weeks ago.
Protesters, many of them wearing their trademark black with face masks, took cover from the tear gas behind umbrellas and held their ground on Sunday, some throwing tear gas canisters back at police as a helicopter flew overhead.
They built barricades with trolleys and trash cans and other debris. One threw a petrol bomb at police in the Wan Chai metro station.
At least one petrol bomb landed in the grounds of central government offices where several windows were smashed.
Police, who traditionally raise placards warning of retaliation before firing tear gas or firing water cannon, made several arrests, grappling people to the tarmac. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.
The water cannon fired blue dye, which elsewhere in the world is used to make identification of offenders easier.
The government said that the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, will be out of town for China’s National Day, despite her having sent out invitations for celebrations at home.
Some shops closed ahead of expected demonstrations, while the MTR metro service shut stations, a move that has made it a target of violence in the past.
Protesters shouted anti-China slogans and called for their “five demands, not one less” of the government, including universal suffrage and the dropping of all charges against their arrested colleagues.
About 200 China supporters dressed in red T-shirts gathered on top of Victoria Peak, overlooking the harbour, at around midday. They sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted “I love China”.
Angela, a housewife in her 40s, a Chinese flag sticker plastered on her cheek, said the pro-democracy protesters were “thugs”.
“If the government takes violent action I don’t object,” she said. “We have tolerated enough. I think I have emotional problems because of the riots. Because it’s not safe to go out.”
CHANGE OF HEART
Lam, the focus of weeks of anti-government unrest, will leave for Beijing on Monday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic the following day.
Lam, who was trapped in an indoor stadium by street protests for hours this week after an “open dialogue” with the people, will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night overland, minimising the chances of a clash at the airport, a popular target of anti-government protests.
She had sent out invitations “requesting the pleasure of your company” at a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Tuesday.
It was not immediately clear why she had the change of heart but the government said Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung would stand in for her.
Arthur, 40, wearing glasses and a mask covering the lower half of his face, said Lam’s trip was expected.
“In these three months, Carrie Lam has not really cared about the protesters. She only cares about the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) or what we might call ‘her boss’,” he said. “I think Hong Kong is somehow at this moment the frontline between Western democracy and the dictatorship in China…. Hong Kong looks more and more like a police state.”
Police fired tear gas and water cannon on Saturday night to disperse protesters who threw petrol bombs and rocks, broke government office windows and blocked a key road near the local headquarters of China’s People’s Liberation Army.
Anti-government protesters have attacked the legislature, Beijing’s main Liaison Office, occupied the airport, thrown petrol bombs at police, vandalised metro stations and set street fires in the former British colony.
Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.
The protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.
China dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.
Protests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement. Rallies in support of the anti-government protesters were held in Australia’s largest cities, with the biggest in Sydney.
Many wore face masks to hide their identity and crowds yelled “stand with Hong Kong” and “fight for freedom”, while placards depicted Chinese President Xi Jinping with a cross marked across his face.

NEW YORK: Earth is in more hot water than ever before, and so are we, an expert United Nations climate panel warned in a grim new report Wednesday.
Sea levels are rising at an ever-faster rate as ice and snow shrink, and oceans are getting more acidic and losing oxygen, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report issued as world leaders met at the United Nations.
The agency warned that if steps aren’t taken to reduce emissions and slow global warming, seas will rise 3 feet by the end of the century, with many fewer fish, less snow and ice, stronger and wetter hurricanes and other, nastier weather systems.
“The oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble, and that means we’re all in big trouble, too,” said one of the report’s lead authors, Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “The changes are accelerating.”
The dire effects will be felt on both land and sea, harming people, plants, animals, food, societies, infrastructure and the global economy. In fact, the international team of scientists projected for the first time that some island nations will probably become uninhabitable.
The oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat from carbon pollution in the air, as well as much of the carbon dioxide itself. Earth’s snow and ice, called the cryosphere, are also being eroded.
“The world’s oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe,” said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a deputy assistant administrator for research at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The report found:
Seas are now rising at one-seventh of an inch (3.66 millimeters) a year, which is 2.5 times faster than the rate from 1900 to 1990.
The world’s oceans have already lost 1% to 3% of the oxygen in their upper levels since 1970 and will lose more as warming continues.
From 2006 to 2015, the ice melting from Greenland, Antarctica and the world’s mountain glaciers has accelerated. They are now losing 720 billion tons (653 billion metric tons) of ice a year.
Arctic June snow cover has shrunk more than half since 1967, down nearly 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).
Arctic sea ice in September, the annual low point, is down almost 13% per decade since 1979. This year’s low, reported Monday, tied for the second-lowest on record.
Marine animals are likely to decrease 15%, and catches by fisheries in general are expected to decline 21% to 24%, by the end of century because of climate change.
“Climate change is already irreversible,” French climate scientist Valérie Masson-Delmotte, a report lead author, said at a news conference in Monaco, where the document was released. “Due to the heat uptake in the ocean, we can’t go back.”
But many of the worst-case projections in the report can still be avoided, depending on how the world handles the emissions of heat-trapping gases, the report’s authors said.
The IPCC increased its projected end-of-century sea level rise in the worst-case scenario by nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) from its 2013 projections because of the increased recent melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.
The new report projects that, under the business-as-usual scenario for carbon emissions, seas by the end of the century will rise between 2 feet (61 centimeters) and 43 inches (110 centimeters), with a most likely rise of 33 inches (84 centimeters). This is slightly less than the traditional 1 meter (39 inches) that scientists often use.
And sea level will rise two to three times as much over the centuries to come if warming continues, so the world is looking at a “future that certainly looks completely different than what we currently have,” said report co-author Hans-Otto Portner, a German climate scientist.
The Nobel Prize-winning IPCC requires that its reports be unanimously approved. Because of that, its reports tend to show less sea level rise and smaller harm than other scientific studies, outside experts said.
“Like many of the past reports, this one is conservative in the projections, especially in how much ice can be lost in Greenland and Antarctica,” said NASA oceanographer Josh Willis, who studies Greenland ice melt and wasn’t part of the report.
Willis said people should be prepared for a rise in sea levels to be twice these IPCC projections.
The world’s warm water coral reefs will go extinct in some places and be dramatically different in others, the report said.
“We are already seeing the demise of the warm water coral reefs,” Portner said. “That is one of the strongest warning signals that we have available.”
Outside scientists praised the work but were disturbed by it.
“It is alarming to read such a thorough cataloging of all of the serious changes in the planet that we’re driving,” said Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler. “What’s particularly disturbing as a scientist is that virtually all of these changes were predicted years or decades ago.”
The report’s authors emphasized that it doesn’t doom Earth to this gloomy future.
“We indicate we have a choice. Whether we go into a grim future depends on the decisions that are being made,” Portner said.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump welcomed Australia’s prime minister on Friday for only the second state visit of his administration, signaling the close bond between the two allies as Washington takes on Beijing and Tehran.
Trump and Scott Morrison are expected to discuss security and trade, as China’s increasing assertiveness, especially in the energy-rich South China Sea, has raised concerns within the region and the United States.
The leaders are also set to release a plan on Friday aimed at securing the supply of rare earth minerals, as concerns grow that China, the world’s largest processor and producer of the minerals, could cut off shipments of the prized commodities.
Days before the visit, a sign draped across the Australian Embassy in Washington proclaimed “100 years of mateship” between the two countries. On Friday, Trump feted Morrison’s arrival at the White House’s South Lawn with a 19-gun salute and US Marine Band performances of each nation’s national anthems.
“It’s highly symbolic of where the relationship sits at the moment,” said Patrick Buchan, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting that Morrison’s state visit was second only to French President Emmanuel Macron’s last year.
“Australia played a very smart game with Trump,” he added, noting the country had avoiding directly criticizing him, unlike some European counterparts.
Trump got off to a smooth start with Morrison in May, congratulating him on his surprise election victory in a tweet noting there were “no greater friends” than the United States and Australia.
The two also met on the sidelines of the G20 in June, cementing warm ties that Trump did not enjoy with Morrison’s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. Trump berated Turnbull in February 2017 over a bilateral refugee agreement before abruptly ending their telephone conversation.
Australia also agreed last month to join a coalition to protect oil tankers and cargo ships from threats posed by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz after a series of attacks there that Washington has blamed on Tehran.
Australia has also banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , the world’s top provider of telecoms equipment, from its 5G network, something the Trump administration has struggled to persuade other allies to do. The United States says Huawei’s ties to Beijing make the network equipment it sells to telecoms firms a security risk.
Australian intelligence concluded China was responsible for a cyberattack on Australia’s parliament and its three largest political parties, Reuters reported on Monday.
Following an arrival ceremony, bilateral meetings, and a joint news conference, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will host a luncheon for Morrison to be followed by a state dinner at the White House.
SECURITY AND TRADE
During a visit to Sydney last month by Pompeo and US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the United States and Australia pledged to strengthen opposition to Chinese activities in the Pacific.
China has unnerved the region and angered the United States by installing military equipment and other facilities on artificial islands it has made in the disputed South China Sea.
The United States and its Western allies also worry that China is using foreign aid to secure greater influence over small Pacific countries that control vast swath of resource-rich ocean.
Australia, traditionally the major power in the South Pacific, has promised up to A$3 billion ($2 billion) in grants and loans to counter what Washington describes as China’s “payday loan diplomacy.”
But Morrison has pressed Trump to end his trade war with China, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.

BEIJING: China expressed anger on Tuesday after German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas met prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, saying that no foreign country had a right to interfere in China’s internal affairs.
Wong met Maas on Monday in Berlin at an event hosted by the German newspaper BILD.
After being held for around 24 hours at the Hong Kong airport on Sunday for allegedly breaching the terms of his bail, Wong arrived in Berlin late on Monday evening, where he said he would “continue his battle for free elections”.
The timing is especially awkward as German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Beijing last week. Hong Kong has been gripped by weeks of protests, initially against a now-shelved extradition bill and now focused more on securing greater freedoms for Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China was “extremely dissatisfied and resolutely opposed” to German allowing Wong to visit and to allow him to meet the German foreign minister.
“China has already lodged stern representations with the German side,” Hua told a daily news briefing.
Hong Kong is an internal affair and no foreign government, organisation or individual has a right to interfere, she added.
“Any plots to rely on foreigners to build oneself up or acts or words to split the country are doomed to failure.”
Hua said that during her trip last week, Merkel clearly said that she opposes violence and supports “one country, two systems”.
Hong Kong returned to Beijing from British rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
“We can’t help but ask, what is the purpose of the German side in allowing Joshua Wong to come to Germany at this time and to meet with minister Maas?”
China urges Germany to abide by its promises and avoid sending wrong messages to separatist Hong Kong forces, and urges Maas to abide by the basics of international law and act for the benefit of relations and not be a “damager” of the relationship, Hua added.
Interference by foreign parliaments in Hong Kong‘s matters is deeply regrettable, the leader of the Chinese-ruled city said earlier on Tuesday, adding that an escalation of violence cannot solve social issues in the city.
Carrie Lam was speaking after another weekend of sometimes violent clashes in the former British colony, with police firing tear gas to disperse protesters in cat-and-mouse skirmishes, at times smashing windows and starting street fires.
Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding the autonomy they had been promised. China denies accusations of meddling in the city.

SRINAGAR: India on Sunday imposed curfews in several parts of the contested Kashmir region, after clashes between security forces and Shi’ite Muslims taking part in a procession, officials and eyewitnesses said.
At least 12 locals and six troops were injured on Saturday evening, officials told Reuters, as the worshippers on the traditional mourning procession of Muharram clashed with troops trying to stop it.
Troops used tear gas and pellet guns on the crowd, which insisted on carrying on with the procession, one in a series held at this time of the year, and pelted stones at security forces, an Indian official who declined to named told Reuters.
“The clashes continued till late night during which the troops fired tear gas and pellets,” he added.
A spokeswoman for India‘s interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
“Reasonable restrictions are necessary for peace and protection of life,” India‘s national security adviser had said on Saturday, accusing Islamabad of trying to stoke violence in the region.
Kashmir, a mountainous Muslim-majority region claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been the site of frequent altercations between security forces and locals protesting against New Delhi’s decision to revoke special rights for the portion of the territory that it controls on Aug. 5.
The most recent clashes occurred in Rainawari and Badgam, two Shi’ite majority areas of Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir’s main city.
The five km (3 mile) procession route that passes through the city centre has been barricaded by armed troops wearing helmets and bullet proof vests.
On Sunday, police vans fitted with loud speakers announced curfew-like restrictions in Srinagar’s city center Lal Chowk and adjacent areas, according to two Reuters witnesses.
“People are advised to stay indoors and not venture out of their home,” the police announced.
Suhail Ahmed, a Rainawari resident, said that there have been frequent clashes in the area for last three to four days as troops have been trying to block the procession.
“We hear deafening sounds of tear gas being fired for last few evenings. We mostly stay indoors but the gas comes into our homes making it difficult to sleep,” Ahmed said.
Muharram is the first month of the year according to the Muslim lunar calendar, and traditionally processions are held for the first 10 days of the month to observe the death of Prophet Muhammad’s nephew Imam Hussein, killed in battle in 680.
Shi’ite Muslims typically intensify their expression of suffering on the Ashura day, that this year falls on Tuesday.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests so the Chinese-ruled city can move forward from a “highly vulnerable and dangerous” place and find solutions.
Her televised announcement came after Reuters reports on Friday and Monday revealing that Beijing had thwarted an earlier proposal from Lam to withdraw the bill and that she had said privately that she would resign if she could, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters.
“Lingering violence is damaging the very foundations of our society, especially the rule of law,” a sombre Lam said as she sat wearing a navy blue jacket and pink shirt with her hands folded on a desk in front of her.
The withdrawal, a key demand of protesters but just one of five, came after unrest that drove the former British colony to the edge of anarchy as the government repeatedly refused to back down – igniting pitched battles across the city of seven million, the arrests of more than 1,000 protesters, and leaving a society deeply divided.
Many are furious about perceived police brutality and the number of arrests – 1,183 at the latest count – and want an independent inquiry.
“The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,” Lam said.
“I pledge that the government will seriously follow up the recommendations of the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Council) report. From this month, I and my principal officials will reach out to the community to start a direct dialogue … we must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions.”
The protests began in March but snowballed in June and have since evolved into a push for greater democracy for the city which returned to China in 1997.
The bill would have allowed extraditions to mainland China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
It was not immediately clear if killing the bill would help end the unrest. The immediate reaction appeared sceptical and the real test will be how many people take to the streets.
Some lawmakers said the move should have come earlier.
“The damage has been done. The scars and wounds are still bleeding,” said pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo. “She thinks she can use a garden hose to put out a hill fire. That’s not going to be acceptable.”
WINNING OVER MODERATES?
In the voice recording obtained by Reuters, Lam said at a meeting last week that her room to find a political solution to the crisis was “very limited”, as authorities in Beijing now viewed the situation as a matter of national security.
Beijing’s apparent endorsement of the withdrawal of the bill comes after the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rule since he took power in 2012.
Others said the move was not enough.
“This won’t appease the protesters,” said Boris Chen, 37, who works in financial services. “In any kind of time, people will find something they can get angry about.”
Pro-Beijing lawmaker Cheung Kwok-kwan said Lam’s announcement was not a compromise to appease those promoting violence, but a bid to win over moderates in the protest camp.
“It was likely speaking to the so-called peaceful, rational, non-violent people who were unsatisfied with the government’s response before,” he said.
One woman, Pearl, 69, said the protests were no longer about the bill.
“Some of those guys may change their minds, maybe, but just a minority,” she said of the protesters. “Some of them just want to create trouble and they will continue to do so.”
“Too little, too late,” said Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014 pro-democracy protests which were the precursor to the current unrest, on his Facebook page.
Leung Yiu-ting, president of the Hong Kong Education University student union, said the timing was wrong.
“Until the five demands are met, I don’t think the protests and the social movement will stop,” he said.
The protesters’ other four demands are: the retraction of the word “riot” to describe rallies, the release of all arrested demonstrators, an independent inquiry into the police perceived brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to democratically choose their own leaders.
The chief executive’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill’s withdrawal.
Hong Kong‘s benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped after the report of the bill’s imminent withdrawal, trading up about 4%. The property index also jumped.
Lam had said before that the bill was “dead”, but she did not withdraw it.
CHINA’S WARNINGS
Hong Kong returned to China under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system, hence the anger at the extradition bill and perceived creeping influence by Beijing.
China denies it is meddling in Hong Kong‘s affairs but warned again on Tuesday that it would not sit idly by if the unrest threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.
China has regularly denounced the protests and warned about the impact on Hong Kong‘s economy.
Cathay Pacific Airways has been one of the biggest corporate casualties.
China’s aviation regulator demanded it suspend staff from flying over its airspace if they were involved in, or supported, the demonstrations. The airline has laid off at least 20 including pilots and cabin crew.
The airline on Wednesday announced the resignation of chairman John Slosar, following the departure of CEO Rupert Hogg last month.
The unrest has shown no sign of easing.
Riot police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray – both anti-riot weapons – to clear demonstrators from outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station, with one man taken out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, television footage showed.
The police, who have repeatedly denied using excessive force, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HONG KONG: Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw global attention to their fight for greater democracy for the Chinese-ruled city which is facing its biggest political crisis in decades.
Planes were taking off and landing, with delays, but trains were suspended and approach roads to the airport impassable as protesters erected barricades and overturned trolleys at the airport and in the nearby new town of Tung Chung.
Some passengers were forced to walk the last bit of their journey to the airport by foot, dragging their luggage behind them.
The MTR subway station in Tung Chung was closed and demonstrators smashed CCTV cameras and lamps with metal poles and dismantled station turnstiles. Police appeared to be running in all directions and made several arrests.
Chek Lap Kok, built around a tiny outlying island in the dying days of British colonial rule, is one of the world’s busiest and most efficient airports, reached by a series of bridges which were packed with traffic.
“If we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong,” said one 20-year-old protester, asking not to be named.
Black-clad demonstrators targeted the airport three weeks ago, jamming the terminal in sometimes violent clashes with police and prompting some flights to be cancelled or delayed.
Police said protesters hurled iron poles, bricks and rocks on to the railway track near the airport station and trespassed on the track. By early evening protesters in the immediate vicinity of the airport had left, but protesters in Tung Chung remained.
“We have no idea how to leave. We’re stuck,” a masked protester said, as others looked for buses and ferries to get back home.
Sunday’s demonstration comes after police and protesters clashed overnight in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to the territory when it was handed back to China in 1997.
China denies the charge of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.
Tourist numbers have plummeted in recent weeks and international trade fairs cancelled as the territory faces its first recession in a decade.
China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.
Several hundred demonstrators also gathered outside the British consulate in central Hong Kong, waving Union Jack flags and chanting “God save the Queen”.
SUBWAY VIOLENCE
Parts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway on Saturday, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas. Police said they arrested 63 people aged between 13 and 36.
Amnesty International said the metro violence should be investigated.
“Violence directed at police on Saturday is no excuse for officers to go on the rampage elsewhere,” it said.
The latest protests came on the fifth anniversary of China’s decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong.
The unrest began in mid-June, fuelled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.
But the turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy.
The unrest poses the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.
Protesters have called for a general strike on Monday, but it was not immediately clear who would take part.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of efforts to restore calm and that talks with non-violent protesters would provide “a way out” for the Chinese-ruled city.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied peacefully in torrential rain on Sunday in the eleventh week of what have been often violent demonstrations.
“I sincerely hope that this was the beginning of society returning to peace and staying away from violence,” Lam said.
“We will immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue. This dialogue, I hope, will be based on a mutual understanding and respect and find a way out for today’s Hong Kong.”
Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China for trial.
The unrest has been fuelled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place after Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.
Three people were wounded, one critically, in a knife attack by an unknown assailant near a “Lennon Wall” of colourful pro-protest messages in the city’s Tseung Kwan O district in the New Territories overnight, police said. One man was arrested.
The protests have prompted sharp reactions from Beijing, which has accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest in the territory. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighbouring Shenzhen.
Britain’s Foreign Office said it was extremely concerned about reports that a Hong Kong staff member had been detained in mainland China, but there was no immediate suggestion that there was any link to the protests.
Staff member Simon Cheng did not return to work on Aug. 9 after visiting the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen the previous day, Hong Kong news website HK01 reported. China’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment. Hong Kong police did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc also said on Monday they had dismantled a state-backed social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on the Twitter and Facebook actions, but defended the right of Chinese people to make their voices heard.
Further demonstrations are planned in the next few days, including by MTR subway workers on Wednesday, secondary school students on Thursday and accountants on Friday.
The protests are exacting a toll on the city’s economy and tourism, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.
Singapore universities have cancelled exchange programmes to Hong Kong after Singapore warned its citizens to defer travel there, news website Today reported.
Singapore’s foreign ministry said in an advisory last week large protests in Hong Kong had become unpredictable and could turn violent with little or no notice.
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS
Sunday’s protest turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and protesters could be seen on Sunday night urging others to go home peacefully.
Aside from seeking Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
“The bill is dead,” Lam told Tuesday’s news briefing. “There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns.”
Police have been criticised for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
Lam said the police watchdog had set up a task force to investigate complaints.
She said she hoped Hong Kong had “unique advantages in attracting overseas companies”, stressing the rule of law, but warned of the risk of pressure on the economy which shrank 0.4% in April-June from the previous quarter.
“The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half. Actually, I think the data in the first half has not fully reflected the seriousness of the problem,” she said.
China has put strong pressure on big companies in Hong Kong over the protests, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s departure was announced by Chinese state television and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in protests.
China’s State Council called on Monday for greater development of the southern city of Shenzhen and integration of its culture and economy with neighbouring Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong is gearing up for further protests this week after hundreds of thousands of anti-government demonstrators braved heavy rain to rally peacefully on Sunday, marking a change to what have often been violent clashes.
Sunday’s massive turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the Chinese-ruled city’s airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and on Sunday night protesters could be seen urging others to go home peacefully.
Police said on Monday that while Sunday’s demonstration was mostly peaceful, there were breaches of the peace in the evening when some protesters defaced public buildings and aimed laser beams at officers.
It was a far cry from the violent clashes between protesters and riot police throughout the summer, with activists storming the legislature and targeting China’s main Liaison Office in the city. The weekend was also noteworthy for a lack of tear gas use by police.
The protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. They have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China, including an independent judiciary, but many in the city believe Beijing has been eroding those freedoms.
Aside from Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
One protester, speaking at a “citizen’s press conference” on Monday, was asked what path the protests would take now, peaceful or violent.
“We have started our rallies very peacefully but after two and a half months it seems that the Hong Kong government has not responded to our five demands so one thing leads to another and it may cause escalation,” the speaker, named Wang, said.
“If you ask me, I personally hope there will be a quick resolution to this from the government so we don’t have to protest any more.”
On Sunday, protesters spilling out from Victoria Park, the designated rally area on Hong Kong island, streamed onto major thoroughfares towards the city’s financial centre, chanting for Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam to step down.
Police estimated the size of the crowd in Victoria Park at 128,000 at its peak, although that excludes the masses of umbrella-carrying demonstrators who packed the streets.
CHINESE FORCES ACROSS THE BORDER
The Hong Kong government said in a statement on Sunday night it was important to restore social order as soon as possible and that it would begin talks with the public and “rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down”.
The Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, attributed the change in the character of Sunday’s protest to the presence of Chinese paramilitary forces, which have been conducting exercises in Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong.
“This was widely seen as a stern warning to the violent elements in Hong Kong,” it said, adding that a backlash from Hong Kong residents over last week’s airport occupations was another factor.
The Chinese Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper warned again in an editorial on Monday that hostile foreign influences were inciting the protest movement. Beijing has accused some countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest.
US President Donald Trump hinted on Sunday that the White House would like to see Beijing resolve the protests before the world’s two largest economies could reach a trade deal.
“I would like to see Hong Kong worked out in a very humanitarian fashion,” Trump said. “I think it would be very good for the trade deal.”
Further demonstrations are planned in coming weeks, including protests planned by Christians and even an accountants’ group.
Police have come under criticism for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations, but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
The central government has sought to deepen integration between the mainland and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and nearby Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave which returned to China in 1999. The State Council called on Monday for greater development of the so-called Greater Bay Area and to enrich the “one country, two systems” policy.
China has also put strong pressure on big companies, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s sudden departure was announced by Chinese state television on Friday and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in the protests.
Shares in Cathay rose more than 2% early on Monday before paring gains to be down 0.6%. Jeffries analysts wrote in a note on Monday that it maintained its “buy” rating on Cathay and that it expected the company to remain profitable.

KATHMANDU: Nepal must make training and experience in high altitude climbing mandatory for all climbers on Mount Everest and other high peaks, a government panel said on Wednesday, following the deadliest climbing season in four years.
Eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the 8,850 metre (29,035 feet) mountain in May – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side.
The Nepali panel – made up of government officials, climbing experts and agencies representing the climbing community – was set up after climbers and guides criticised officials after the deaths for allowing anyone who paid $11,000 to climb Everest.
Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Everest, and mountain climbing is a key source of employment and income for the cash strapped nation.
But the numbers attempting the climb in May led to crowding in the so-called death zone, where there are very low oxygen levels. That put lives at risk as oxygen cylinders ran out while up to 100 people waited in the queue.
Nepal issued 381 permits for Everest for this year’s climbing season, which tends to culimate in May, when the daylight and weather is the most forgiving.
“Climbers to Sagarmatha and other 8,000 metre mountains must undergo basic and high altitude climbing training,” the panel said in a report submitted to the government, referring to the Nepali name of Mount Everest.
The report said those hoping to climb Everest must climb at least one Nepali peak above 6,500 metres before getting a permit. Climbers must also submit a certificate of good health and physical fitness, and be accompanied by a trained Nepali guide, it said.
Ghanshyam Upadhyaya, a senior Tourism Ministry official, said the recommendations would be implemented.
“The government will now make the required changes in laws and regulations guiding mountain climbing,” he told Reuters.
Mira Acharya, a member of the panel said “climbers died due to altitude sickness, heart attack, exhaustion or weaknesses and not due to traffic jams”.
She said the compulsory provision of guides for each climber was to discourage solo attempts which put lives at risk.
A reliable weather forecasting system should be in place and rope fixing should be done in time, giving enough space for the climbers to use a window of good weather to reach the summit, the report said.

HONG KONG: Flights leaving Hong Kong were disrupted for a second day on Tuesday, plunging the former British colony deeper into turmoil as its stockmarket fell to a seven-month low, and its leader said it had been pushed into a state of “panic and chaos”.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also urged Hong Kong to exercise restraint and investigate evidence of its forces firing tear gas at protesters in ways banned under international law.
Ten weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and protesters have roiled the Asian financial hub as thousands of residents chafe at a perceived erosion of freedoms and autonomy under Chinese rule.
China this week condemned some protesters for using dangerous tools to attack police, calling the clashes “sprouts of terrorism”. They present President Xi Jinping with one of his biggest challenges since he came to power in 2012.
Hong Kong legal experts say Beijing might be paving the way to use anti-terror laws to try to quell the demonstrations.
Check-in operations were suspended at 4.30 pm on Tuesday, a day after an unprecedented airport shutdown, as thousands of black-clad protesters jammed the terminal, chanting, singing and waving banners.
“Take a minute to look at our city, our home,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said, her voice cracking, at a news conference in the government headquarters complex, which is fortified behind 6-foot (1.8-m) -high water-filled barricades.
“Can we bear to push it into the abyss and see it smashed to pieces?”
The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed suspects’ extradition to mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy.
At the airport, thousands of protesters gathered in the arrivals hall, as well as some parts of departures, using luggage trolleys to blockade the doors to customs checkpoints.
Floors and walls were covered with missives penned by activists and other artwork. The scene was peaceful as knots of protesters spoke to travellers, explaining their aims.
“Sorry for the inconvenience, we are fighting for the future of our home,” read one protest banner at the airport.
“I think paralysing the airport will be effective in forcing Carrie Lam to respond to us … it can further pressure Hong Kong’s economy,” said Dorothy Cheng, 17.
Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997.
They want Lam to resign. She says she will stay.
“My responsibility goes beyond this particular range of protest,” she said, adding that violence had pushed the territory into a state of “panic and chaos”.
As she spoke, the benchmark Hang Seng index hit a seven-month low. It shed more than 2%, dragging down markets across Asia.
Lam did not respond to questions at a press briefing to clarify if she had the power to withdraw the extradition bill and satisfy a key demand made by the protesters, or if she needed Beijing’s approval.
AIRPORT DISRUPTED
Airport authorities had earlier suspended check-in operations as the fifth day of a sit-in by protesters grew increasingly heated. Crowds continued to swell in the evening.
“Terminal operations at Hong Kong International Airport have been seriously disrupted as a result of the public assembly,” the airport authority said.
Some passengers challenged protesters over the delays as tempers began to fray, while the demonstrators, using a Chinese term of encouragement, chanted, “Hong Kong people – add oil!”
Flag carrier Cathay Pacific warned: “There is potential for further flight disruptions at short notice.”
The airline, whose British heritage makes it a symbol of Hong Kong’s colonial past, is also in a political bind.
China’s civil aviation regulator demanded that the airline suspend staff who joined or backed the protests from flights in its airspace, pushing the carrier’s shares past Monday’s 10-year low.
Other Chinese airlines have offered passengers wanting to avoid Hong Kong a free switch to nearby destinations, such as Guangzhou, Macau, Shenzhen or Zhuhai, with the disruption sending shares in Shenzhen Airport Co Ltd surging.
On Monday China said the protests had reached a critical juncture, after a weekend of street clashes in which both police and protesters appeared to toughen their resolve.
Police fired tear gas at the blackshirted crowds in districts on Hong Kong island, Kowloon and the New Territories.

HONG KONG/BEIJING: China’s aviation regulator on Friday demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend personnel who have engaged in illegal protests in the city from staffing flights into its airspace from August 10.
Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Last week, a Cathay pilot was among over 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.
On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said that Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website.
The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights.
Crew members that have not gained the authority’s approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations.
The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.
In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: “We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly.”
“The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific. There is zero tolerance for any inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour that may affect aviation safety. We deal with these incidents very seriously.”
Cathay said on Thursday it respects “everyone’s right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner,” while insisting it “recognises that Hong Kong SAR is a part of China”.
“We do not condone any activities that jeopardise the stability of Hong Kong,” it said.
On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights.
Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respects its staff’s opinions.
“We certainly wouldn’t dream of telling them what they have to think about something. They’re all adults, they’re all service professionals. We respect them greatly,” he said.
Global Times, published by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, ran news stories this week highlighting Cathay employees’ participation in the ongoing protests.
Embattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam on Friday urged an end to the violence, claiming that the protests are dragging on the city’s economy.
Hong Kong-listed Cathay is 45% owned by Swire Pacific and 22.7% held by Air China , according to Refinitiv Eikon.
The airline has been Hong Kong’s flag carrier since the colonial era. Swire Pacific’s parent, John Swire & Sons Ltd, is a UK-based conglomerate with businesses ranging from property to transportation.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Wednesday it would expel India’s ambassador and suspend bilateral trade with its arch-rival after New Delhi stripped its portion of the contested Kashmir region of special status.
Neighbours China and Pakistan, which both claim parts of the region, have voiced fierce opposition to India’s move dropping a constitutional provision that had allowed the country’s only Muslim-majority state to make its own laws.
Moin-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s newly-appointed ambassador to India, had yet to take up his post but will now not move to New Delhi, while Indian Ambassador Ajay Bisaria will be expelled, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a telephone interview with Pakistani TV channel ARY News.
“It is very obvious that our ambassador wouldn’t be in Delhi, and obviously the man who is here will also leave,” Qureshi said.
Earlier Pakistan’s National Security Committee, a panel of top government and military officials chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, said it would implement a range of measures over what it called India’s “illegal” decision to revoke Kashmir’s special status.
That includes “downgrading of diplomatic relations with India” and a further review of bilateral arrangements between the two countries, a committee statement said, without elaborating further.
Qureshi told Pakistan’s parliament on Wednesday the country was consulting with China regarding Kashmir and that he might fly to Beijing for discussions with officials there.
A spokesman for India’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ISLAMABAD/MUZAFFARABAD: Pakistan said on Tuesday it was considering further diplomatic and military pressure on India after the Hindu-majority nation stripped its portion of contested Kashmir of special status.
India on Monday dropped a constitutional provision for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which has long been a flashpoint in ties with neighbouring Pakistan, to make its own laws.
Nuclear arch-rivals India and Pakistan both claim Muslim-majority Kashmir in full but rule it in part. They have fought two wars over the territory and came close to a third this year after a car bomb set off by a Pakistan-based militant group killed dozens of Indian paramilitary police.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday India’s removal of special status for Kashmir, which included prohibiting outsiders from owning property, was an attempt to alter the demographics of the region and was illegal under international law.
“We will fight it at every forum. We’re thinking how we can take it to International Court (of Justice)… to the United Nations Security Council,” Khan said in an address to Pakistan’s parliament.
Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, accusing India of violating Security Council resolutions on Kashmir.
Qureshi is returning early from the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as a result of the crisis, the foreign ministry said.
India maintains its actions in Kashmir are legal both under domestic and international law.
Earlier on Tuesday, Pakistan’s army chief said the country’s military will “go to any extent” to support people in the region.
“Pakistan Army firmly stands by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end,” said General Qamar Javed Bajwa after meeting with top commanders in Rawalpindi.
“We are prepared and shall go to any extent to fulfil our obligations in this regard,” he added, without elaborating further.
BUSINESS SHUTDOWN
In Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir around 45km (28 miles) from the contested border between the neighbours, protests continued for a second day with hundreds of people including children shouting anti-India slogans.
In the Neelum Valley, which sits on the border and has seen heavy shelling between the two countries in recent weeks, there was a shutdown of shops and businesses in protest at India’s decision.
Many people in Kashmir have relatives on both sides of the border, but people on the Pakistani side say they have been unable to contact those in India for several days after New Delhi restricted internet and phone access.
Tanveer-ul-Islam migrated from India to Muzaffarabad in 1990. His family, including his elderly mother and siblings, live in the Badgam district of Indian Kashmir, but he said he has been unable to contact them for two days.
“My day does not begin until I speak to my mother, but I have not been able to talk to her (since) Aug 4. You can’t even imagine my pain,” he said. “We do not know about the well being of anyone across the divide”.
His wife Haleema Akhtar, whose family is in Magam in Indian-administered Kashmir, said she was also unable to contact them.
“I called my daughter and son-in-law in the US to try to contact them, but they too expressed helplessness in the face of the clampdown on communication,” she said.

HONG KONG: Police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong on Sunday after violent clashes a day earlier, and Beijing said it would not let the situation persist.
The Chinese-controlled city has been rocked by months of protests against a proposed bill to allow people to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China and they have now grown into calls for greater democracy.
A general strike aimed at bringing the city, an Asian financial hub, to a halt is planned for Monday.
After the peaceful demonstrations finished, hundreds of masked protesters blocked roads in the town of Tseung Kwan O in the New Territories, set up barricades and hurled hard objects, including bricks at a police station.
Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters after a separate rally in the island’s Western district where thousands of people gathered to urge authorities to listen to public demands.
Protesters had began a march towards China’s Liaison Office which has been a flashpoint at previous protests.
Police said the protesters were “participating in an unathorised assembly”, similar to Saturday when they fired multiple tear gas rounds in confrontations with black-clad activists in the Kowloon area.
Police said they had arrested more than 20 people for offences overnight including unlawful assembly and assault. The protests have become the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule 22 years ago after being governed by Britain since 1842. China’s official news agency Xinhua said on Sunday: “Central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue. We firmly believe that Hong Kong will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges ahead.”
During the day protesters had marched brandishing coloured leaflets, called for a mass strike across Hong Kong on Monday and shouted “Restore Hong Kong” and “Revolution of our time.”
“We’re trying to tell the government to (withdraw) the extradition bill and to police to stop the investigations and the violence,” said Gabriel Lee, a 21-year-old technology student.
Lee said what made him most angry was that the government was not responding to any of the protesters’ demands or examining the police violence.
What started as an angry response to the now suspended extradition bill, has expanded to demands for greater democracy and the resignation of leader Carrie Lam.
“Even if Carrie Lam resigns, its still not resolved. It’s all about the Communist Party, the Chinese government,” said Angie, a 24-year-old working for a non-government organisation.
Protesters on Saturday set fires in the streets, outside a police station and in rubbish bins, and blocked the entrance to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon peninsula.
Shops in the tourist and commercial area Nathan Road, normally packed on a Saturday, were shuttered including 7-11 convenience stores, jewellery chain Chow Tai Fook and watch brands Rolex and Tudor.
Thousands of civil servants joined in the anti-government protests on Friday for the first time since they started in June, defying a warning from authorities to remain politically neutral.
PROTEST TACTICS
The protests have adapted rapidly since the start of June with the movement spreading from the Admiralty area, where the legislative council is located, across to the whole city for the first time.
Previous protests have also targeted mainland visitors to try and make them understand the situation in what is officially termed a Special Administrative Region of China.
Young people have mostly been at the forefront of the protests, infuriated with broader problems including sky-high living costs and what they see as an unfair housing policy skewed towards the rich.
However, the demonstrations have seen people of all ages, including families and the elderly take part.
The protests mark the biggest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took office in 2012.
Hong Kong has been allowed to retain extensive freedoms, such as an independent judiciary but many residents see the extradition bill as the latest step in a relentless march toward mainland control.
Months of demonstrations are taking a growing toll on the city’s economy, as local shoppers and tourists avoid parts of one of the world’s most famous shopping destinations.
Matthew Wang, a 22-year-old marketing executive for a multinational corporation, said that the government was “encouraging people to become more radical to affect decision making because they are not addressing any of the demands.”

182,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/us-believes-osama-bin-ladens-son-hamza-is-dead-official/,"NEW YORK: The United States believes that Hamza bin Laden, a son of slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and himself a notable figure in the militant group, is dead, a US official said on Wednesday.
The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, provided no further details, including when Hamza died or where.
President Donald Trump earlier on Wednesday declined to comment after NBC News first reported the US assessment. Asked if he had intelligence that bin Laden’s son had been killed, Trump told reporters: “I don’t want to comment on it.”
Separately, the White House declined comment on whether any announcement was imminent.
Hamza, believed to be about 30 years old, was at his father’s side in Afghanistan before the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and spent time with him in Pakistan after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan pushed much of al Qaeda’s senior leadership there, according to the Brookings Institution.
Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces who raided his compound in Pakistan in 2011. Hamza was thought to be under house arrest in Iran at the time, and documents recovered from the compound indicated that aides had been trying to reunite him with his father.
The New York Times reported that the United States had a role in the operation that led to Hamza’s death, which it said took place in the past two years. Reuters could not immediately verify those details.
Still, the US government’s conclusion appears to be a recent one. In February, the State Department said it was offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading “to the identification or location in any country” of Hamza, calling him a key al Qaeda leader.
Introduced by al Qaeda’s chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio message in 2015, Hamza provided a younger voice for the group whose ageing leaders have struggled to inspire militants around the world galvanized by Islamic State, according to analysts.
Hamza has called for acts of terrorism in Western capitals and threatened to take revenge against the United States for his father’s killing, the US State Department said in 2017 when it designated him as a global terrorist.
He also threatened to target Americans abroad and urged tribal groups in Saudi Arabia to unite with Yemen’s al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to fight against Saudi Arabia, it said.
In March, Saudi Arabia announced it had stripped Hamza bin Laden of his citizenship, saying the decision was made by a royal order in November 2018.

KUALA LUMPUR: An undocumented domestic worker has the right to pursue her claim for unpaid wages in Malaysia, a court has ruled, setting a legal precedent migrant rights groups said would help protect human trafficking survivors.
In a landmark ruling this week, a high court in Malaysia said an Indonesian domestic worker who was not paid for nearly five years can pursue her case after it was dismissed earlier by labour authorities because she did not have a work permit.
“This is a precedent for all undocumented workers,” Glorene Das, executive director at the Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Tuesday.
“With this precedent, there is hope for undocumented workers to seek redress in court. They are workers who have been exploited in trafficked and forced labour situations,” she said by phone.
Malaysia relies heavily on foreign workers in areas such as manufacturing, domestic work and on plantations, hosting millions of migrant labourers from countries such as Indonesia, Nepal and Bangladesh.
But many of them are victims of human trafficking who were duped by brokers with promises of lucrative pay, often arriving without a valid work permit, and then suffer abuses later.
The Indonesian woman, who is in her 20s and whose name was withheld by Tenaganita for privacy reasons, fled to the group’s shelter in 2017. Tenaganita helped her file the legal case over unpaid wages.
She sought about 30,000 Malaysian ringgit ($7,300) in unpaid wages at the government’s labour department and then a labour court, but both rejected her case.
She lodged an appeal with a high court last year, which ruled on Monday that it was “premature” for the claim to be thrown out based on the work permit status, according to Tenaganita and the Malaysiakini news website.
The court also ordered the case to be fully heard.
“All I want is my wages that I have worked for, so that I can go home to my family,” the Indonesian woman said in a statement provided by Tenaganita.
The high court and the labour department could not be reached on Tuesday due to a public holiday.
Indonesia and Cambodia, key sources of migrant workers to Malaysia, have in the past temporarily banned their citizens from going to work in Malaysia as maids after cases of abuse.
Malaysia has said this year that it was ready to “declare war” on human trafficking and forced labour, with a review of labour laws was underway.
The U.S. State Department’s 2019 Trafficking in Persons report put Malaysia in its Tier 2 Watch List – the second-lowest ranking – for not meeting the minimum standards in efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

LONDON: Travelers faced a second day of travel disruptions in Britain on Friday after a heat wave gave way to thunderstorms, and technical problems at the air traffic control center grounded many flights at the country’s two main airports on one of the busiest days of the year.
A day after the country potentially recorded its hottest day ever, travelers at London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports faced delays after the UK’s air traffic controller, NATS, said it had identified a technical problem that was causing flight restrictions.
It was not clear if the matter was related to the hot weather or the ensuing thunderstorms.
“We are doing all we can to fix it as soon as possible,” NATS said in a statement.
Eurocontrol, the European air traffic body, said the technical problem is being caused by an “issue with radar displays” and hefty delays are expected for flights arriving at Heathrow and Gatwick for the rest of Friday.
This weekend is a big travel moment as families head off for their summer holidays now that schools have broken up for the academic year.
Britain, along with much of Western Europe, endured one of its hottest days ever on Thursday, potentially its hottest. The country’s weather service said a provisional temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.7 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded at Cambridge University Botanic Garden in eastern England, which if confirmed would be the highest ever recorded in the UK.
The existing record for the UK is 38.5 Celsius (101.3 Fahrenheit), was set in August 2003.
It said “quality control and analysis over the next few days” will determine whether the reading becomes official.
Rail commuters were also facing delays after the heat wave prompted Network Rail to impose speed restrictions in case the tracks buckled. Engineers from the company have been working to get the network back to normal after the track temperatures soared to up to 20 C (68 F) more than the air temperature.
“With the railway being made of metal and moving parts, the sustained high temperatures took their toll in places,” said Phil James of Network Rail. “Everything was done to keep trains moving where possible, and last night hundreds of staff were out fixing the damage and repairing the railway ready for today.”
Passengers using Eurostar services to and from Paris were also facing “severe disruption” due to overhead power line problems in the French capital, which on Thursday recorded its hottest day ever with the temperature rising to 42.6 C (108.7 F).
Authorities across Europe were looking to address the consequences of Thursday’s soaring temperatures, as records that had stood — in some cases for decades — fell.
Europeans and tourists alike jumped into fountains, lakes, rivers or the sea to escape a suffocating heat wave rising up from the Sahara. Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands — all places where air conditioning is not typically installed in homes, cafes or stores — strained under the heat.
In France, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner linked the country’s 60 drowning deaths so far this month indirectly to the current heat wave, warning that drownings are up 30% this month compared to last July.
Castaner noted a rise in people drowning in unguarded bodies of water as they seek relief from high temperatures, some of whom suffer thermal shock when they jump from hot air into cold water.
In Belgium, a 66-year-old woman died near her caravan close to the beach.
The woman was found by a neighbor late Thursday afternoon after she had apparently been basking in the blazing sun. The incident happened in Middelkerke on the Belgian coast as temperatures rose in the region to over 40 degrees Celsius. (104 Fahrenheit)
Middelkerke police commissioner Frank Delva told The Associated Press that the death is “very clearly linked to the heat.”
Emergency services rushed to the scene but could not resuscitate the woman.

185,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/food-for-trash-indias-first-garbage-cafe-to-offer-meals-for-plastic/,"NEW DELHI: Hungry, but don’t have cash? No problem, bring plastic waste and get a free meal, said the mayor of an Indian city where the country’s first “garbage cafe” will open next month.
The small restaurant in the eastern city of Ambikapur will provide hearty food to homeless and poor people and encourage citizens to keep their streets clean, said mayor Ajay Tirkey.
“Everybody is welcome to donate plastic. The cafe will be mainly run by women… Preparations are in full swing!” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Wednesday.
Single-use plastics are banned in many states, but Indians still generate 26,000 tonnes of plastic waste every day, according to government data. The waste is often dumped in streets, drains and landfills.
The Garbage Cafe, inspired by similar cafes that have opened in countries including Cambodia and Belgium, wants to change that.
In exchange for one kilogram (2.2 lb) of plastic, the cafe will serve a curry with rice, lentils, and papadams, said Tirkey, estimating that would take a couple of hours to collect.
For half that weight, punters will receive a breakfast of samosas, lentil doughnuts or stuffed flatbreads.
A waste management system set up in 2015 and run by women who go door-to-door collecting plastic for recycling, has helped make Ambikapur one of India’s cleanest cities.
The city built a road made entirely of plastic in 2015, India’s first and earns 1.2 million rupees ($17,400) a month selling plastic and recycled paper to private companies, according to Tirkey.
In a similar move earlier this year, a school in northeastern Assam state started providing free schooling to students in exchange for plastic waste.

The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology said Thursday that researchers discovered a method to imprint a special structure on the surface of chocolate that makes it shimmer and shine like a rainbow.

The university said the process mimics the effect of chameleon skin, which can change to display specific colours.
It said the rainbow chocolate is ready for industrial production and the scientists are already in talks with big chocolate makers.

187,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/scientists-claim-to-find-ancient-seawall-off-israeli-coast/,"HAHOTRIM BEACH, ISRAEL: An international team of researchers says it has discovered a 7,000-year-old-seawall along Israel’s Mediterranean coast, providing evidence that coastal communities protected themselves against rising waters even in ancient times.
The scientists believe the more than 100-metre-long (110-yard-long) structure acted as a fortification against surging waters and storms. The study, published Wednesday in the Public Library of Science One journal, said the Neolithic era village, called Tel Hreiz, was abandoned and eventually swallowed by the sea.

“Here we have an example, a practical example of a process that is still going on. We can see a whole community which are now under the sea,” said Ehud Galili, lead researcher and archaeologist from Israel’s Haifa University.
The researchers believe the structure was built by villagers out of riverbed boulders found several kilometres (miles) away. The site lies just south of the northern Israeli port city of Haifa.
While seas were rising at a faster rate during the Neolithic period than they are today, the causes were much different, according to co-author Jonathan Benjamin from Flinders University in Australia.
“There’s a big difference between climate change and prehistory which was naturally occurring, and climate change now, which is due to this huge human intervention,” Benjamin said.
Still, similar to contemporary coastal communities, Benjamin said the villagers of Tel Hreiz had to make “the very human decision” to stay or go as the coastline receded.
The ancient settlement was first exposed in the mid-1960s and re-covered by thick sands. After winter storms along the coast in 2012 and 2015 moved these sediments, the structure was uncovered.
Archaeologists have also dug up pottery, animal and human remains that, based on carbon dating, are believed to be from the same settlement.
The community, Galili said, was an “early Mediterranean fishing village” which relied on farming, animal husbandry and exploitation of the land and sea. During the excavations, they also found early examples of olive oil extraction.
At first, researchers considered the possibility that the wall was built for other reasons like agriculture or protection from attackers. But Galili said that during this period, enemies would have come from land and not the sea. He also said there was no sign that the wall extended around the village to defend against land invasions. He concluded the wall “has no other function possible” except to protect against the elements.
Researchers say the seawall itself — found about 120 metres (130 yards) off the coast — is the only structure of its kind found in Israel’s coastal region, making it a “unique example” of the human response to the threat of shrinking coastlines in the Neolithic period.
Roland Gehrels, a physical geographer at Britain’s University of York who specializes in sea-level studies and was not involved in this study, called the discovery a “fascinating find.” He said, however, that the structure was more likely meant to protect against storms than gradually rising sea levels.
“I doubt that humans would have been able to notice this sea-level rise in their lifetime, but they were of course well aware of winter storms and the damage those caused,” he said.
Matteo Vacchi, an expert in coastal changes in the Mediterranean at the University of Pisa who also did not participate in the study, agreed the exact purpose of the seawall is hard to determine. “But what is interesting is that there was this kind of approach of coastal protection even in the Neolithic,” he said.

Now 70 and one of the world’s most popular and acclaimed novelists, Murakami debuted with “Hear the Wind Sing” in 1979, four years after he began writing while running a jazz bar in Tokyo. His 1987 romantic novel “Norwegian Wood” was his first best-seller, establishing him as a young literary star. His latest novel, “Killing Commendatore,” hit US bookstores last year.

Media-shy Murakami’s last public readings were in Kobe and Ashiya in western Japan, where he grew up, following a deadly 1995 earthquake there. On Tuesday, he was joined by award-winning young female novelist Mieko Kawakami, a longtime Murakami fan who was in the audience at both events 24 years ago before she became a novelist.
After the two authors took turns reading passages from their works, Murakami said, “Actually, I have a brand new novel that I wrote a few weeks ago, and I haven’t even published it.” He said it is called “Confessions of a Shinagawa Monkey” and is a sequel to “A Shinagawa Monkey,” a story of a woman named Mizuki who forgets her name because a monkey had stolen it, published as part of a 2002 compilation, “Five Strange Tales from Tokyo.”
The new story takes place at a small Japanese hot spring hotel where a monkey appears as the protagonist takes a bath. The monkey, apparently speaking in Japanese, offers to wash his back, and explains he was raised by a professor and grew up listening to classical music such as Joseph Bruckner and Richard Strauss. The monkey faced discrimination in the conformist monkey community and ended up at the hot springs hotel where he is hired as a helper and given an attic to live in.
After the protagonist invites the monkey to his room for a chat over beer, the monkey says he is called Shinagawa Monkey and reveals he has a bad habit of stealing part of the names of women he falls in love with by taking their driver’s licenses and other identification cards, causing them to forget their names.
Murakami said ” Confessions of a Shinagawa Monkey” takes about 50 minutes to read, so he read a 30-minute abridged version for the event. Murakami comically acted out conversation between the monkey and the protagonist, setting off laughter from the floor. He said the story may be published in the near future.
Without any video cameras present, Murakami appeared relaxed as he and Kawakami took turns reading their works. Kawakami won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize in 2008 for “Breasts and Eggs” and has penned other award-winning novels including “Dreams of Love, etc,” “Yearning” and “Heaven.”
The two authors have published a new book, “A Horned Owl Takes Off at Dawn: A long long interview by Kawakami Mieko,” a collection of her interviews of Murakami.

189,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/new-autism-guidelines-focus-in-early-diagnosis-treatment/,"
CHICAGO: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) on Monday issued its first new autism treatment guidelines in 12 years aimed at helping doctors identify at-risk children and getting them the care they need as early as possible.
Since developmental delays are often present in very young children with autism, the report, published in the journal Pediatrics, urges doctors to check for issues during all well-baby visits and refer children for treatment at the first sign of an issue, rather than wait for a formal autism evaluation.
More than five million Americans are living with autism, a spectrum of disorders marked by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive behaviours of widely varying severity.
“The benefit of identifying children as early as possible is they can then be referred for treatment,” Dr Susan Levy, a developmental and behavioural paediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and co-author of the report, said in a phone interview.
Early treatment and particularly behavioural interventions do make a difference, Levy said.
Since 2007, when AAP published its last two guidance documents, the number of children in the United States diagnosed with autism has risen sharply. Autism now affects 1 in 59 children in the United States, up from 1 in 155 in 2007.
In that time, scientists have developed a better understanding of the potential risk factors and genes that contribute to autism, the related medical and behavioural conditions that commonly occur in children with the condition, and have detailed evidence on which interventions work best.
“This report is really focused on educating paediatricians and other healthcare providers about all the options and issues, and working to empower them since they’re in the front lines to make the early referrals,” Levy said.
The report urges doctors to steer families toward interventions backed by research and away from those with flimsy evidence. It specifically calls out many nutritional interventions that “do not have evidence to support their use.”
It also focuses on the need to screen for and treat other conditions that commonly occur in children with autism.
Some 40% of individuals with autism have intellectual disability, the report said, and about 40% to 60% of school-aged children and adults with autism have anxiety disorders. Others include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), language disorders, sleep and feeding disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms and seizures.
The report encourages doctors to share decision making with families and help them plan for when a child transitions to adolescence and adulthood.

190,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australia-firefighters-accidentally-spread-blaze-ahead-of-heatwave/,"SYDNEY: A backburning operation intended to contain a massive wildfire in eastern Australia sparked out of control, damaging buildings and cutting off major roads, authorities said, as the country heads into another heatwave that may topple temperature records.
The accident occurred about 250 km (155 miles) northwest of Sydney, where firefighters were trying to stop a blaze of some 378,000 hectares (934,000 acres) reaching communities by employing pre-emptive controlled burning.
“We saw a dramatic shift in conditions, a flare-up of fire, some extraordinary behaviour of that fire, and that fire has spread,” New South Wales state Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Monday.
Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the area, Fitzsimmons added, although he did not give an exact figure. There were no new reports of casualties on Monday.
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned nearly 3 million acres of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Bushfires are common in Australia‘s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
Spot fires that would normally be contained on their own have been fanned by wind, coming together into what authorities have called megafires to Sydney’s north, west and south, prompting evacuations and sporadically shrouding the country’s biggest city in smoke.
The Bureau of Meteorology warned of severe to extreme heatwave conditions in the inland parts of the country’s south-east, with temperatures expected to approach or exceed a national average record of 40.3 degrees Celsius (105.4 degrees Fahrenheit).
“We saw significant heat build over Western Australia over the course of last week, and that heat is now pushing east over the continent, which is going to lead to several days of exceptional heat,” bureau climatologist Blair Trewin said in a statement.
“We’re closely monitoring the development and progression of this heat but based on current forecasts we could see that record broken this week.”
The Rural Fire Service’s Fitzsimmons said the heat would exacerbate fire danger, and “despite the very best efforts of everyone, we’re not going to able to contain these fires that we’re expecting later in the week.”

Samoa said a state of emergency will be extended to December 29 with 5,154 cases of measles now reported since the outbreak started in October. Samoa has a population of only 200,000.
Measles started appearing en masse earlier this year in the New Zealand city of Auckland, a hub for travel to and from small South Pacific islands.
The majority of those who have died in Samoa due to the highly infectious disease have been aged four and under. The island nation had a far lower vaccination rate than its regional neighbours.
Following a mandatory immunization campaign, the Samoan government said approximately 93% of all eligible people in Samoa have now been vaccinated against measles.
“Prevention through vaccination is the most effective way of avoiding illness and a costly health emergency,” New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in a statement announcing the funding.
Under the plan, children under five and new mothers and their families will be targeted for vaccination. The funding would be directed to the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
WHO has described the fact children die from a vaccine-preventable disease as a “collective failure” to protect the world’s most vulnerable children.
The organization said measles infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children.
The picture for 2019 is even worse, it said, with provisional data up to November showing a three-fold increase in case of numbers compared with the same period in 2018.
Measles epidemics have occurred this year in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine.

Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under the Department of Health Services has come up with national guideline for snakebite management in Nepal.
According to EDCD an estimated 20,000 people get  bitten by snakes and 10 per cent of them succumb to snakebites, across the country, every year.
Earlier, there was a protocol on snakebite management published by Ministry of Health in 2003.

The national guideline has explained about kinds of snakes found in Nepal, clinical manifestation of common venomous snakes, diagnosis of snakebite, clinical syndrome of snakebite, first aid treatment for patient of snakebite, referral of snakebite patients to health facilities and their role for snakebite management. The guideline explains about condition of referral, management of snakebite when no anti-venom is available and prevention of snakebite.
“The guideline will provide information on venomous snakes found in Nepal and will help in diagnosis of snakebite and its management. The guideline is intended to ensure standardised, timely and effective management of snake bite in the country. This guideline, I hope will be helpful for all health practitioners, army and police personnel, who have been working in preventing and treating snakebite patients, across the country,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.
The government is committed to achieving the national target, which is aligned with World Health Organisation’s target of 50 per cent reduction in deaths and disabilities due to snakebite by 2030.
“The guideline will help health workers to ensure early intervention and efficient use of anti-venom to save lives,” added Dr Lal. The national guideline is expected to avoid misuse of anti-venom, help early recognition of clinical features of snakebite, reaction to anti-venom, and provide appropriate management including artificial ventilation for patients if required.
Snakebite is life threatening medical emergency and survival of snakebite patients depends largely on appropriate first aid measures and immediate transportation to the nearest health centre where facility to administer anti-snake venom and supportive care is available.
The division has planned to train master trainers to help prevent snakebite in all provinces across the country.

193,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/thunberg-a-bit-surprised-to-be-time-person-of-the-year/,"MADRID: Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg said she was surprised and honoured on Wednesday to be named Time’s youngest Person of the Year, while adding that others in the global movement she helped inspire deserve to share the accolade.
The 16-year-old Swede has become the face of a new generation of environmental activists, drawing large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences over the past year and a half. Some have welcomed her work, including her speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming. But others have criticized her sometimes combative tone.
“For sounding the alarm about humanity’s predatory relationship with the only home we have, for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders, for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads, Greta Thunberg is Time’s 2019 Person of the Year,” the media franchise said on its website.

As she left a UN climate conference in Madrid, Thunberg told The Associated Press that she was “a bit surprised” at the recognition.
“I could never have imagined anything like that happening,” she said in a phone interview.
“I’m of course, very grateful for that, very honoured,” Thunberg said, but added: “It should be everyone in the Fridays for Future movement because what we have done, we have done together.”
Thunberg said she hoped the message being pushed by her and other activists — that governments need to drastically increase their efforts to combat climate change — is finally getting through. The “Greta effect” has already been linked to a rise in support for environmental parties in Europe.
But she insisted that the media should also pay attention to other activists, particularly indigenous people, whom she said “are hit hardest by the climate and environmental crisis.”
Her concern over the slayings of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon drew a harsh rebuke from the Latin American nation’s president Tuesday.
“Greta said that the Indians died because they were defending the Amazon,” Jair Bolsonaro said. “It’s impressive that the press is giving space to a brat like that,” he added, using the Portuguese word ”pirralha.”
Thunberg responded by changing her bio on Twitter, where she has over 3 million followers, to say “Pirralha.”
The teenager has also been a strong advocate of science, regularly citing complex studies about the causes and impacts of climate change.
On Wednesday, Thunberg used her address at the UN’s annual climate summit to accuse governments and businesses of misleading the public by holding talks that she said aren’t going to stop the world’s “climate emergency.”
“The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR,” she said.
Thunberg cited scientific reports showing that national pledges to reduce reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions aren’t enough to meet the ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsis (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.
“This is not leading, this is misleading,” she told officials, adding that “every fraction of a degree matters.”
Thunberg said the youth climate movement, which has staged repeated worldwide protests attended by hundreds of thousands of people, has managed to spread awareness about the need to urgently emissions and help those already affected by global warming.
“To get in a sense of urgency in the conversation that is very needed right now to be able to move forward,” she said. “That, I think, is our biggest success.”
Asked whether she thought world leaders were beginning to respond to this message, Thunberg told the AP: “They say they listen and they say they understand, but it sure doesn’t seem like it.”
“If they really would listen and understand then I think they need to prove that by translating that into action,” she added.
Thunberg said the experience of the past 15 months, going from solo-protester outside the Swedish parliament to speaking in front of world leaders at the UN General Assembly, had changed her.
“I think life is much more meaningful now that I have something to do that has an impact,” she said.
Thunberg has tried to preserve some privacy despite the relentless interest she’s received from media and adoring fans.
She was mobbed on her arrival in Madrid last week and the attention paid to her appearances at the climate conference has far outstripped that of other events, save for Hollywood stars like Harrison Ford.
“I would like to be left alone,” Thunberg said when asked about her immediate plans. But before heading home to Sweden, to spend Christmas with her family and dogs, she will attend a climate protest Friday in Turin, Italy.
“After that, I have no school to return to until August because I’ve taken a gap year,” she said.
“I will probably continue a bit like now, travel around. And if I get invitations, to come. And just try everything I can,” she added.
Last year’s Time winners included slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi; the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, where five people were shot to death; Philippine journalist Maria Ressa; and two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.

The information was made public at a press conference organised jointly by Bookworm Foundation and Random Readers Society here on Tuesday.

On the occasion, the Foundation’s director Ajit Baral said that new speakers would be given a chance in response to complaints that familiar faces appeared at the forum every year.
More than 110 speakers including over a dozen foreign writers are expected to participate in the festival with more than 40 sessions. Participation of foreign writers is expected to boost the sector of Nepali literature, said Baral.
The festival’s four editions were organised in Kathmandu and the rest in Pokhara. Pokhara was picked for the festival in a bid to promote literary tourism, said Baral, adding that the venue was also shifted due to the 2015 earthquake.
The Society’s President Keshab Sharan Lamichhane claimed that the festival had helped explore Pokhara’s literature.
The DSC Award for South Asian Literature will also be presented at the festival. The award carrying a purse of USD 25,000 is an international literary prize given annually to writers of any ethnicity or nationality writing on South Asian themes such as politics, culture, history and people.

Sanna Marin, 34 from the dominant Social Democrats, was nominated on Sunday. Centre Party chief Katri Kulmuni, 32, will get the finance post when the full new cabinet is announced this week, party members said.
Finland‘s government resigned last week after the Centre Party said it had lost confidence in Social Democrat Prime Minister Antti Rinne over his handling of a postal strike.
The five parties in power – four of them led by women – decided to stay in coalition and continue with the same programmes, but said there would be a reshuffle.
“We want to make the axis between the prime minister and the finance minister work,” Kulmuni said. “That is the foundation for this new generation of collaboration (between the Social Democrats and the Centre Party),” she added.
There was no immediate comment from Marin, the former transport minister.
She has had a swift rise in Finnish politics since becoming head of the city council of her industrial hometown of Tampere at the age of 27.
She will take over in the middle of a wave of strikes, which will halt production at some of Finland‘s largest companies from Monday. The Confederation of Finnish Industries estimates the strikes will cost the companies a combined 500 million euros ($550 million) in lost revenue.
Kulmuni, who previously held the more junior position of Minister of Economic Affairs, replaces Mika Lintila. She took over as the head of the Centre Party from ex-prime minister Juha Sipila in September.
Green Party leader Maria Ohisalo, 34, will continue as interior minister, the Left Alliance’s chairwoman Li Andersson, 32, as education minister and the Swedish People’s Party’s Anna-Maja Henriksson, 55, as justice minister.
Rinne will remain the Social Democrats leader at least until he chairs the party’s conference in June.

196,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australia-braces-for-more-fires-as-extreme-temperatures-predicted/,"SYDNEY: Thousands of firefighters were fortifying containment lines on Monday as temperatures were forecast to soar, increasing the danger of a fresh wave of bushfires across Australia‘s east coast.
More 100 fires remain ablaze in the region, and authorities warned conditions would worsen on Tuesday when temperatures were predicted to top 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).
Seeking to minimise the threat, firefighters safely burned grassland around homes to remove fuel, said NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.
“Firefighters are trying to take advantage of the more moderate conditions… and establish as many significant containment options as they can,” Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. “It is an enormous amount of work with more than 2,000 people out in the field.”
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Such fires are common in Australia‘s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring this year have caught many by surprise. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
In the small city of Hawkesbury, about 50 km (31.1 miles) north-west of Sydney, residents joined firefighters to safeguard their properties.
Mayor Barry Calvert said residents were trying to clear foliage from around their homes, and opening gates to ensure emergency workers have access.
Calvert said many locals were struggling to move animals and livestock in an area renowned for breeding racehorses.
“We’ve opened the showground for people to move their animals, but many people here may have 20 horses and only two horse boxes so they can’t move them quickly,” Calvert told Reuters.
The wildfires have blanketed Sydney – home to more the 5 million people – in smoke and ash for more than a week, turning the daytime sky orange, obscuring visibility and prompting commuters to wear breathing masks.
Australia‘s worst bushfires on record destroyed thousands of homes in Victoria state in February 2009, killing 173 people and injuring 414.

In the book launch interaction held with veteran writers, sociologists and mediapersons, in Kathmandu, on Saturday, litterateur and writer Nayanraj Pandey said the novel ‘Dulari’ elaborated troubles and difficulties faced by Dalit communities especially Musahar.
He said novelist Muna Chaudhary has step-by-step presented the economic exploitation imposed by society on people from marginalised communities and added that the author also cleverly uses Tharu terms and has described them in Nepali to make readers understand. Pandey, however, pointed out that readers would have to keep patience as the main plot unfolds very slowly as the story develops.

Likewise, sociologist Priyanka Kapar said the novel was equally suitable for people from different walks of life as it has touched on the reality of the present state of affairs in Tarai. She said the novel compelled her to recollect how Tharu people practised the ‘untouchability’ with various Dalit communities. She said she was impressed with the author’s way of addressing how women lose their names after getting married in Tarai. However, she pointed out that the novel lacks a historical background of the Musahar community.
Similarly, publishing team member Anbika Giri thanked author Chaudhary for her effort to write a novel on the isolated story. She said the story matches reality as it includes the conditions of people reeling under poverty in Tarai.
Novelist Muna Chaudhary said she found her aspiration to write the novel from her day-to-day experiences and her encouraging husband. She said the novel presents the story of a woman born in a Dalit community and the difficulties and challenges she faces due to limitation set against a marginalised community. The story is narrated from a woman’s perspective.
Muna Chaudhary, who is also treasurer member of ‘Tharu Sahitya Kendra’, has worked on two short stories — ‘Machan’ and ‘Chat’.

There were 96 fires burning in New South Wales, home to Australia’s largest city of Sydney, with only about a half contained and more than 1,600 firefighters deployed to do back burning and create containment lines.
Sydney with its population of 5.2 million has been blanketed by unhealthy haze and smoke for weeks, with conditions worsening on Friday as several fires merged into a giant blaze that may take weeks to put out.
Australia has been through some devastating bushfires before during its hot summers, but fire officials have said that this earlier-than-usual wave of fires has been one of the most persistent and largest.
NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told Australia’s ABC television on Sunday that temperatures will be raising to above normal by Tuesday, reaching 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), threatening the spread of the fires and new blazes.
More smoke is to be expected around Sydney on Sunday as firefighters will do preventive work.
“Crews are going to be actively out there lighting up large tracts of land, kilometres of trails and tracks, and getting into bushland areas in an attempt to bring those fires under control and start putting it into consolidation with containment lines,” Fitzsimmons said.
The fires have been blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson and with much of the country under a long-lasting drought, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been under pressure to address the impact of climate change.
In mid-November, 14 mayors of fire-stricken areas signed a letter urging the government to acknowledge a correlation between climate change and the devastating bushfires, asking also for more funds.
While some additional money has been provided, Morrison has repeatedly rejected any links between the fires and his conservative policies, including support for the coal industry.
On Saturday, the government issued a report suggesting that Australia is on track to meet its emission reduction target, which under the Paris Agreement calls for the country to reduce its emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2030.
The government acknowledged, however, that it uses so-called carryover credits, which allow for counting emissions reduction from the past towards future targets – a practice criticised by the European Union and Pacific countries threatened by climate change.

199,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/nobel-literature-winner-dreams-of-a-new-narrative-style/,"STOCKHOLM: Nobel Literature Prize winner Olga Tokarczuk says she thinks a new sort of fiction may be needed to counteract the modern era’s tendency to isolate and divide people.
In her Saturday lecture in Stockholm ahead of receiving the prize next week, the Polish author complained of the “exhausting white noise of oceans of information” in the internet era.

“It has turned out that we are not capable of bearing this enormity of information, which instead of uniting, generalizing and freeing, has differentiated, divided and enclosed us in individual little bubbles,” she said.
Tokarczuk suggested this discourages people from understanding how actions are interconnected, thus contributing to climate crisis and political tensions.
She said she dreams of a new kind of “fourth-person” narrator in fiction who could encompass the views of each character in a novel.
“We can regard this figure of a mysterious, tender narrator as miraculous and significant. This is a point of view, a perspective, from which everything can be seen. Seeing everything means recognizing the ultimate fact that all things that exist are mutually connected into a single whole, even if the connections between them are not yet known to us,” she said.
Tokarczuk is the 2018 literature laureate.  Her prize was announced only two months ago because the Swedish Academy postponed naming a winner last year due to internal turmoil connected with a sex abuse scandal.
The 2019 Nobel Literature winner, Peter Handke, has also brought controversy to the body because of widespread criticism of him as an apologist for Serbian war crimes during the 1990s. One Swedish Academy member said he is boycotting Nobel ceremonies this year in protest of Handke’s selection and a member of the literature nominating committee has announced his resignation.
Handke jousted with journalists who were questioning his views at a Friday news conference, saying he preferred receiving soiled toilet paper to answering their questions. But his lecture on Saturday was contemplative, telling how his writing was first inspired by religious litanies he heard from a village church. He concluded by reciting a poem by the late Swedish Nobel laureate Tomas Transtomer in which an angel whispers “do not be afraid of being human.”
The Nobel prizes in physics, chemistry, medicine, economics and literature are being presented Tuesday in the Swedish capital.
Earlier Saturday, several Nobel laureates in science spoke about climate change at their news conferences in Stockholm.
Didier Queloz, an astronomer who shares this year’s Nobel physics prize for discovering a planet outside the Earth’s solar system, said people who shrug off climate change on the grounds that humans will eventually leave for distant planets are wrong.
“The stars are so far away I think we should not have any serious hope to escape the Earth,” Queloz said. “We’re not built to survive on any other planet than this one … we’d better spend our time and energy trying to fix it.”

200,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/brick-kiln-workers-health-at-risk/,"Exposure to dust particles, smoke, carbondioxide has made them susceptible
Kathmandu, December 7 
A recent research conducted on 20 brick kilns of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur has revealed that brick kiln workers are at high risk of respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and asthma.
Among the 400 brick kiln workers, a total of 159 participants had suffered from flu one month prior to the survey. Meanwhile, 91 participants (22.8 per cent) had pneumonia.
The research conducted by Resource Centre for Primary Health Care revealed that 75.5 per cent participants were not aware of chronic diseases. The research also revealed that workers were susceptible to body aches and joint pain because they had to carry heavy loads.

“As brick kiln workers have to work with dust and smoke, they are likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses such as asthma, chronic cough, chronic bronchitis, and wheezing, said Dr Kedar Narsingh KC, chest physician.
Dust particles and carbon dioxide from the burning of bricks impacts the health of brick kiln workers and the public. “People are likely to suffer from bronchitis and asthma. Long-term exposure to such particles lead to hypertension, cardiac problems and cancer. Also, exposure to such particles lead to skin problems such as irritation of skin and allergies,” Dr KC added
“The research was conducted to know the health status of workers in brick kilns. It was also conducted to find information regarding occupational safety,” said Purna Duwal, a researcher.
From among the participants, 75.5 per cent did not know about chronic health impacts of dust and smoke.
Meanwhile, 61.8 per cent of the participants knew about the importance of wearing mask. “Though brick kiln workers were given masks to prevent exposure to dust particles and smoke, they did not use them as ordinary masks made breathing difficult,” said Duwal. The research team has recommended that special masks be provided to enable workers to breathe easily. It has also recommended that new tools and equipment be used in brick kilns to lessen the smoke and its health hazards.
The research also revealed that 69.5 per cent brick kiln workers had to spend their own money on treatment.
“Immediate action should be taken to reduce brick kiln workers’ exposure to smoke and dust,” said Dr KC.

201,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/samoa-says-almost-90-of-people-vaccinated-against-measles-after-deadly-outbreak/,"MELBOURNE: Samoa said on Saturday nearly 90% of eligible people had been vaccinated against measles as it lifted a two-day curfew imposed amid an outbreak that has killed 65 in recent weeks.
There were, however, 103 new cases of measles reported since Friday, Samoa‘s Health Ministry said it a statement.
The measles virus has infected almost 4,500 people in the South Pacific nation of just 200,000 since late October. Of those who died, 57 were children under the age of four.
The mandatory immunisation campaign aims to vaccinate 90% of the population, tripling Samoa‘s coverage in just a few weeks. The government said a rate of 89% had been achieved as of Friday.
Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as parents shun immunisation for philosophical or religious reasons, or fears, debunked by doctors, that such vaccines could cause autism.
Samoa and the United Nations appealed on Friday to the international community for about $10.7 million to battle and recover from the crisis.
“The impacts of this emergency will be far reaching on Samoa and our people, particularly our young generations,” Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said in a statement.
“It is imperative therefore to strengthen the culture of acceptance of vaccination in order to create ‘herd immunity’. This is a painful lesson we have learnt from the current crisis.”
New Zealand and a number of other countries and organisations, including the UN agency UNICEF, have delivered thousands of vaccines, medical supplies and have sent medical personnel to help with the outbreak.
The World Health Organisation said this week that measles infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children.
The picture for 2019 is even worse, it said, with provisional data up to November showing a three-fold increase in case numbers compared with the same period in 2018.

202,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/activists-cheer-for-greta-urge-climate-action-in-madrid/,"MADRID: Activists of all ages and from all corners of the planet demanded concrete action Friday against climate change from leaders and negotiators at a global summit in Madrid.
The march was led by dozens of representatives of Latin America’s indigenous peoples — a mark of deference after anti-government protests in Chile, the original host of the summit, resulted in the talks suddenly being moved to Europe for the third year in a row.

Celebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg declared from a stage that “change is not going to come from the people in power, it’s going to come from the masses.” A crowd of thousands responded chanting “Greta! Greta!”
Organisers claimed 500,000 people turned out for the march, but authorities in Madrid put the number at 15,000 without an immediate explanation for the disparity in the count.
The Swedish teen was followed on her first day in Madrid by a swarm of cameras and reporters, as well as curious members of the public wanting to film her on their smartphones, from the very first step she took out of an overnight train from Lisbon.
Two young activists earned cheers as they abseiled from a bridge and strung out a banner saying: “Just 8 years till 1.5 degrees C. HOW DARE YOU?” — a reference to scientists’ forecasts of rising temperatures and what activists complain is a lack of a convincing political response to the threat.
The crush as people tried to get a glimpse of Thunberg led her to pull out shortly after the start of the march, saying police had advised her to leave for safety’s sake, and she climbed into an electric car.
A Madrid police spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity because she wasn’t authorised to be named in media reports said that it had only been “suggested” to that Thunberg leave after she appeared “overwhelmed” by the attention and that police never ordered the activist to abandon on safety grounds.
Earlier in the day, the 16-year-old had said at a press conference that calls for real action against climate change are still being “ignored” by political leaders despite their continuous praise of the global environmental youth movement she helped create.
Thunberg hoped the COP25 summit would lead to “something concrete” and “increasing awareness among people in general,” but she said that after more than one year of student strikes” still basically nothing has happened.”
“The climate crisis is still being ignored by those in power,” she added.
During the Dec. 2-13 talks, nearly 200 countries are meant to streamline the rules on global carbon markets and agree on how poor countries should be compensated for destruction largely caused by emissions from rich nations.
An official directly involved in the negotiations said that despite a few setbacks, the technical negotiations were progressing, although many issues were being left for ministerial-level meetings in the summit’s second and final week.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the discussions, added that a political declaration on greater “ambition” — a buzzword at the summit — was shaping to be “difficult to achieve.”
“A summit that doesn’t end with enhanced ambition would be something that nobody would understand if we take into account what the streets and science are telling us,” the official said.
The talks came as evidence mounts about disasters that could ensue from further global warming, including a study published Friday predicting that unchecked climate change could devastate fishery industries and coral reef tourism.
The study commissioned by 14 nations whose economies rely heavily on the sea says climate change could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in losses by 2050, adding that limiting global warming would lessen the economic impact for coastal countries, but that they also need to adapt to ocean changes.
Demands for greater action by non-governmental organisations and a whole new generation of environment-minded activists were expected to take the spotlight with the presence of Thunberg in Madrid.
Past appearances have won her plaudits from some leaders — and criticism from others who’ve taken offence at the angry tone of her speeches.
Asked about the scepticism on global efforts to fight the warming temperatures expressed by some world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, she said: “Some people want everything to continue like now, they are afraid of the change that we, the youth, are bringing.”
“They try so desperately to silence us,” she added.
Next to her, Vanessa Nakate, a 22-year-old member of Uganda’s chapter of Fridays for Future said that young activists don’t want more promises.
“We are tired of the praises that you keep giving the activists,” she said. “We want you to act.”
During a brief visit to the summit venue earlier on Friday, Thunberg did not appear unsettled by the commotion surrounding her presence.
“It’s absurd. I laugh at it. I do not understand why it has become like this,” she was quoted as saying by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet.
“I don’t like being at the centre of the focus all the time, but this is a good thing,” she told Aftonbladet. “As soon as the media writes about me, they also have to write about the climate crisis. If this is a way to write about the climate crisis, then I guess it is good.”
Separately Friday, an alliance of American states, cities, academic institutions and companies opened its own venue at the UN climate talks, aiming to show that despite the federal administration’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris accord, many Americans remain committed to the treaty’s goal of curbing global warming.
Elan Strait, who manages the “We Are Still In” initiative for the environmental conservationist World Wildlife Fund, said the movement is “a short-term band-aid not only to get those carbon dioxide emissions down but also to encourage policymakers to lay the ground for further achievements.”
“And that, regardless of the colour of the government that is in power,” Strait said.
Over 3,800 organizations and corporations representing 70% of US economic output have joined the coalition, organizers claim, amounting to roughly half of the country’s emissions.

203,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/giant-fire-near-sydney-may-burn-for-weeks-as-people-struggle-to-breathe/,"MELBOURNE: A giant bushfire on the edge of Sydney, which has blanketed the city in smoke causing a spike in respiratory illnesses and the cancellation of outdoor sports, will take weeks to control but will not be extinguished without heavy rains, firefighters said.
Thousands of weary firefighters, who have been battling bushfires for a month, were on Saturday fighting nearly 100 blazes in New South Wales state.
The mega fire north of Sydney, Australia’s largest city, was created on Friday when several fires merged and was now burning across 335,000 hectares (830,000 acres).
“We need flooding rain to put these fires out. That’s really what is going to stop it,” said the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “These will take many weeks to put out.”
Bushfires are common in Australia during the hot summer, which begins in December, but this year the fires started much earlier, blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson.
A three-year drought has left much of Australia tinder dry.
The fires around Sydney have been pumping such vast amounts of smoke into the air that they appear as significant rain on the radars, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.
New South Wales Health said late on Friday that some 1,140 people had sought medical assistance for breathing issues or asthma in the past week – a quarter more than in a typical week. NSW Ambulance fielded about a third more calls.
Six people have been killed, nearly 700 houses burnt down and millions of hectares of land razed.
Strong winds fanned flames towards several suburbs in southwest Sydney on Saturday.
“It’s been going on all day, a fire came from the back and we put it out. But then another one came from the side so the firies covered the house in foam.,” said Luke Wright who helped save his brother’s home.
“The fence has been damaged but that’s about it, very lucky,” Wright told local media.
Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said the worst might still be ahead, with temperatures forecast to rise into the 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in coming days and no meaningful rainfall expected until late January.
“It’s a tough couple of months ahead yet and we’ve already seen the horrific consequences of fire so far this season,” Fitzsimmons told Australia’s 9News on Saturday.
Neighbouring Queensland state was battling some 45 bushfires and temperatures on Saturday as high as 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).

The Global Climate Risk Index, published on Wednesday by environmental think-tank Germanwatch, rated Japan as the most weather-affected country in 2018, hit by a triple whammy of extreme summer heat, torrential rainfall and the most powerful typhoon in a quarter-century.
Germany, another industrialised country, was in third position as its hottest-ever April-July period led to the deaths of more than 1,200 people and widespread drought in 2018.
India – in fifth position – suffered one of its longest-ever heatwaves that year, bringing water shortages, crop failures and riots, on top of monsoon floods and two strong cyclones, Germanwatch said in a report.
“Recent science has confirmed the long-established link between climate change and the frequency and severity of extreme heat,” it added in a statement.
In 2018, the severe summer heatwave in Japan killed 138 people and caused more than 70,000 people to be hospitalised with heat stroke and exhaustion, the report said.
Across Europe, scientists calculate extreme heat spells are now up to 100 times more likely than a century ago, it added.
The report noted that the impact of heatwaves on African nations may be under-represented due to a lack of data.
Powerful storms, meanwhile, left a trail of destruction in 2018, with the Philippines second in the climate risk index due to large losses inflicted by top-strength Typhoon Mangkhut.
Madagascar was the fourth most weather-hit country as two cyclones killed about 70 people and forced 70,000 to seek refuge.
In Kenya and Rwanda – seventh and eighth in the index – seasonal rains were much heavier than normal, causing floods that destroyed homes and livestock and fuelled diseases.
Laura Schaefer, a policy advisor with Germanwatch, told journalists at the U.N. climate talks in Madrid that the index results showed that the “signs of climate crisis”, on all continents, could no longer be ignored.
“But climate impacts most existentially hit developing countries and communities around the world – and create a real climate crisis for millions of people,” she said, adding that the poor had the fewest resources to cope.
Between 1999 and 2018, seven of the 10 places most affected by extreme weather were lower-income developing nations, with Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti at the top, Germanwatch said.
In the past 20 years, nearly half a million deaths were directly linked to more than 12,000 extreme weather events worldwide, while economic damages exceeded $3.5 trillion, the report said.
At the U.N. climate talks on Wednesday, Chile’s environment minister, who is presiding over the conference, and U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa told journalists Latin American nations were vulnerable to weather disasters fuelled by climate change, highlighting the need for them to become more resilient.
Espinosa said her own country, Mexico, suffered every year from droughts, floods and wildfires.
“It is not about whether this year it will be bad. No, it is about how bad and where?” she said. “This is the reality of almost all the countries in the region.”
Germanwatch joined developing states and aid agencies in urging U.N. negotiators to regularly assess the needs of vulnerable countries struggling with “loss and damage” linked to climate change, and provide new funding to repair it.
Wealthy nations have long resisted pressure to stump up such finance, beyond expanding insurance programmes. But as the cost of extreme weather increases globally and planet-heating emissions continue to rise, that pressure is growing.
Renato Redentor Constantino, head of the Philippines-based Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities, said it was “plainly unacceptable” that those suffering the most had done the least to cause the problem, given their historically low emissions.
“The extreme weather events we have been facing are a result of emissions that the world failed to eliminate,” he said.

The report states that 11 countries in WHO South-East Asia Region — Bangladesh, Bhutan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Timor-Leste — had an estimated eight million cases and 11,600 malaria deaths, respectively 69 and 70 per cent less compared to 2010. Moreover, the Maldives and Sri Lanka have been certified malaria-free countries while Timor-Leste and Bhutan are close to elimination target.
The WHO report further stated that India reduced its reported cases by half as compared to 2017 and Bangladesh and Thailand also reported a substantial decline in reported cases.
All countries in the region are on target to achieve more than 40 per cent reduction in case incidence by 2020, and all have strategic plans for malaria elimination by 2030.
“There is a strong commitment to eliminate malaria in the region, reflected in the commendable intense efforts and progress being made by member countries. This momentum needs to be sustained and further accelerated to prevent, rapidly detect and treat malaria, to benefit everyone, everywhere,” Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia was quoted in the statement released by WHO.
However, the report claimed that despite progress, an estimated 1.61 billon people in the region are still at risk of contracting malaria with the disease being endemic in nine countries.
The progress and challenges in malaria elimination are periodically reviewed by member countries.

LONDON: The award-winning short film, “My Time”, was inspired by seeing a friend being bullied at school for having a period stain on her clothes, its director Giulia Gandini said on Tuesday.
The young girl had just started her first period but the teacher refused to allow her to use the toilet during class – a rule that applies to seven out of 10 girls in Britain today, according to the children’s charity Plan International.

“I wish that I had seen this film when I was 12,” the London-based director, who grew up in Italy, said at a screening on Tuesday. “I developed this relationship to menstrual blood that was very negative.”
Gandini’s film is the latest to tackle the stigma around menstruation, following last year’s Bollywood movie “Padman” and the Netflix documentary “Period. End of Sentence.”, which won an Oscar this year.
Shame can be deadly. In Nepal, the centuries-old Hindu practise of “chhaupadi”, where women are banished from their homes during their periods, has led to numerous deaths from suffocation and snake bites.
Despite government schemes to provide free sanitary products in British schools, “period shaming” persists, with one in three women saying they have been bullied, isolated or joked about over “the curse”, research by the charity ActionAid found.
“It was a deliberate choice to set it in the UK – you still have this kind of shame and taboo,” said Gandini, adding that she only “started questioning why I was feeling so awful about something so natural” years after her friend’s humiliation.
Gandini said her goal as a filmmaker is to dispel stigmas and show the reality of young women’s lives in a positive light.
“Films don’t only reflect culture but they have the power to shape it,” she said, highlighting negative comments she received from men while making the film, with some asking, “Why should I care about menstrual blood?”
“My Time” has won multiple awards, including at the Chicago International Children’s Film Festival, London’s TweetFest and Sweden’s BUFF International Film Festival.
Gandini said her film has a happier ending than the event she witnessed at school, with a clear feminist message of “being proud of who you are”.

207,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/drug-can-curb-dementias-delusions-researchers-find/,"SAN DIEGO: A drug that curbs delusions in Parkinson’s patients did the same for people with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia in a study that was stopped early because the benefit seemed clear.
If regulators agree, the drug could become the first treatment specifically for dementia-related psychosis and the first new medicine for Alzheimer’s in nearly two decades. It targets some of the most troubling symptoms that patients and caregivers face — hallucinations that often lead to anxiety, aggression, and physical and verbal abuse.
Results were disclosed Wednesday at a conference in San Diego.
“This would be a very important advance,” said one independent expert, Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation.
Although the field is focused on finding a cure for dementia and preventing future cases, “there is a huge unmet need for better treatment” for those who have it now, said Maria Carrillo, the Alzheimer’s Association’s chief science officer.
The drug is pimavanserin, a daily pill sold as Nuplazid by Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. It was approved for Parkinson’s-related psychosis in 2016 and is thought to work by blocking a brain chemical that seems to spur delusions.
About 8 million Americans have dementia, and studies suggest that up to 30% of them develop psychosis.
“It’s terrifying,” said Dr. Jeffrey Cummings of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. “You believe that people might be trying to hurt you. You believe that people are stealing from you. You believe that your spouse is unfaithful to you. Those are the three most common false beliefs.”
He consults for Acadia and helped lead the study, which included about 400 people with dementia and psychosis. All were given a low dose of the drug for three months, and those who seemed to respond or benefit were then split into two groups. Half continued on the drug and the others were given dummy pills for six months or until they had a relapse or worsening of symptoms. Neither the patients nor their doctors knew who was getting what.
Independent monitors stopped the study when they saw that those on dummy pills were more than twice as likely as those on the drug to relapse or worsen — 28% versus nearly 13%.
There were relatively few serious side effects — 5% in the drug group and 4% in the others. Headaches and urinary tract infections were more common among those on the drug. Two deaths occurred, but study leaders said neither was related to the drug.
Carrillo said the study was small, but the drug’s effect seemed large, and it’s not known whether the federal Food and Drug Administration would want more evidence to approve a new use.
Current anti-psychotic medicines have some major drawbacks and are not approved for dementia patients.
“They’re often used off label because we have very few other options,” Fillit said.
All carry warnings that they can raise the risk of death in elderly patients, as does Nuplazid.
Cost could be an issue — about $3,000 a month. What patients pay can vary depending on insurance coverage.

208,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/restoring-forests-1-tree-at-a-time-to-help-repair-climate/,"MADRE DE DIOS, PERU: Destruction of the forests can be swift. Regrowth is much, much slower.
But around the world, people are putting shovels to ground to help it happen.
They labour amid spectacular recent losses — the Amazon jungle and the Congo basin ablaze, smoke from Indonesian rainforests wafting over Malaysia and Singapore, fires set mostly to make way for cattle pastures and farm fields. Between 2014 and 2018, a new report says, an area the size of the United Kingdom was stripped of forest each year.


Rebuilding woodland is slow and often difficult work. And it requires patience: It can take several decades or longer for forests to regrow as viable habitats, and to absorb the same amount of carbon lost when trees are cut and burned.
And yet, there is urgency to that work — forests are one of the planet’s first lines of defense against climate change, absorbing as much as a quarter of man-made carbon emissions each year.
Through photosynthesis, trees and other plants use carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to produce chemical energy to fuel their growth; oxygen is released as a byproduct. As forests have shrunk, however, so has an already overloaded Earth’s capacity to cope with carbon emissions.
Successful reforestation programs take into account native plant species. They are managed by groups with a sustained commitment to monitoring forests, not just one-off tree planting events. And usually, they economically benefit the people who live nearby — for instance, by creating jobs, or reducing erosion that damages homes or crops.
The impact could be great: A recent study in the journal Science projected that if 0.9 billion hectares (2.2 billion acres) of new trees were planted — around 500 billion saplings — they could absorb 205 gigatonnes (220 gigatons) of carbon once they reached maturity. The Swiss researchers estimated this would be equivalent to about two-thirds of man-made carbon emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
Other scientists dispute those calculations, while some fear the theoretical promise of tree-planting as an easy solution to climate changes could distract people from the range and scope of the responses needed.
But all agree that trees matter. And in many places around the world, people are working to revive them:
— In a region of southeastern Peru called Madre de Dios, forestry researcher Jhon Farfan inspects lands where the forest has already been lost to illegal gold mining.
After cutting and burning centuries-old trees, miners used diesel pumps to suck up deep layers of the earth, then pushed the soil through filters to separate out gold particles. To turn gold dust into nuggets, they stirred in mercury, which binds the gold together but also poisons the land.
Left behind are patches of desert-like land — dry, sandy, stripped of topsoil and ringed by trunks of dead trees.
Last December, Farfan and other scientists with the Peru-based nonprofit CINCIA planted more than 6,000 saplings of various species native to this part of the Amazon, including the giant shihuahuaco, and tested different fertilizers. Since the project began three years ago, the team has planted more than 42 hectares (115 acres) with native seedlings, the largest reforestation effort in the Peruvian Amazon to date.
— After miners left West Virginia’s Cheat Mountain in the 1980s, there was an effort to green the coal mining sites to comply with US law. The companies used heavy machinery to push upturned soil back into place, compacting the mountainside with bulldozers. The result was soil so packed in that rainwater couldn’t seep down, and tree roots couldn’t expand.
Companies planted “desperation species” — grasses with shallow roots or non-native trees that could endure, but wouldn’t reach their full height or restore the forest as it had been. On Cheat Mountain and at other former mining sites across Appalachia, more than a million acres of former forests are in similar arrested development.
Now Michael French, director of operations for the Kentucky-based nonprofit Green Forests Work, and his colleagues are collaborating with the US Forest Service to restore native Appalachian forests and the rare species they support — by first tearing down other trees.
Green Forests Work has reforested around 800 acres within the Monongahela, and it is taking a similar approach to other former mining sites across Appalachia, having reforested around 4,500 total acres since 2009.
— Maria Coelho da Fonseca Machado Moraes, nicknamed Dona Graça, runs a tree nursery that grows seedlings of species native to Brazil’s lesser-known jungle — the Atlantic coastal rainforest.
She collaborates with a nonprofit group called Save the Golden Lion Tamarin, which works to protect and restore the forest habitat of the endangered namesake monkey. “The Atlantic rainforest is one of the planet’s most threatened biomes, more than 90% of it was deforested,” said Luis Paulo Ferraz, the nonprofit’s executive secretary. “What is left is very fragmented.”
As she nears 50, Dona Graça says she is furious at what has happened to the forest, which was whittled down to allow for the urban expansion of Rio de Janeiro and other cities.
And so, between feeding her chickens and raking the leaves, she grows seedlings of rare species. She mixes limestone and clay, places it in plastic nursery bags and plants seeds in them. She irrigates them with water and cow urine.
Local replanting efforts — which aim to reconnect fragmented parcels of forest — often use the seedlings from Dona Graça’s nursery.
She does this, she said, for posterity.
“In the future when I pass away … that memory I tried to leave for the people is: It’s worth it to plant, to build,” she said.

The 233-year-old Academy was forced to introduce a several new measures after a sex scandal involving the husband of a former member escalated into a bitter row that resulted in them having to postpone the award for 2018.
One of the actions taken was adding external members to assist the Nobel committee choose prize candidates for the 18-man strong Academy to vote on.
“I leave my job in the Nobel Committee because I have neither the patience nor the time to wait for the result of the work to change that has been started,” author Kristoffer Leandoer said in an article published in Svenska Dagbladet. “The Academy and I have a different perspective on time, one year is far too long in my life and far too short in life of the Academy.”
Leandoer said quitting was not linked to the decision to award the 2019 prize to controversial Austrian writer Peter Handke, for which the Academy has received criticism both domestically and internationally.
The Academy confirmed in a statement that Leandoer and Gun-Britt Sundstrom had left the Nobel committee, which until today was comprised of four members of the Swedish Academy and five external members.
Sundstrom could not immediately be reached for comment.
“We are grateful for the significant effort they made during the year and we are now reviewing how the work of the Nobel Committee will be organised for the 2020 Nobel Prize in literature, ” Mats Malm, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, said in the statement.

MELBOURNE: The number of suspected cases of measles on the Pacific island of Samoa has more than doubled over the past week to 3,530 and deaths related to the outbreak rose to 48 from 20 a week ago, the country’s Ministry of Health said on Sunday.
Samoa has become vulnerable to measles outbreaks as the number of people becoming immunised has declined with the World Health Organisation (WHO) saying vaccine coverage is just about 31%.
The government started a mandatory vaccination programme on Nov 20 after declaring a state of emergency due to the outbreak. The health ministry said in its statement that 57,132 people have since been vaccinated.
Schools and universities have been closed and most public gatherings banned on the island state of just 200,000, located south of the equator and halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand.
Of the 48 deaths, 44 were among children under the age of four. Since Saturday, there have been 173 new cases of measles recorded and four people have died.
Neighbouring New Zealand and a number of other countries and organisations, including the UN agency UNICEF, have delivered thousands of vaccines, medical supplies and have sent medical personnel to help with the outbreak.
Measles, a highly contagious virus that spreads easily through coughing and sneezing, has been reported also in other Pacific nations, including Tonga and Fiji, but there have been no reports of deaths and the countries have greater vaccination coverage.
Tonga’s ministry of health said in a statement late last week that there were 394 cases of suspected measles identified, but only eight people required hospitalisation.
Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as parents shun immunisation for philosophical or religious reasons, or fears, debunked by doctors, that such vaccines could cause autism.

Swedish activist Greta Thunberg had been due to join a student strike in Lisbon, but her environmentally friendly voyage across the Atlantic from New York by yacht was hit by high winds, delaying her by a few days, she told social media followers.
Portugal’s student movement still expected thousands to join marches on Friday, building on the famous campaigner’s imminent arrival to mobilise ahead of the United Nations climate summit in Madrid from December 2-13.
“We wish she’d been here, but the movement has to carry on without her. We’ve got to send our message and pressure politicians ahead of the climate summit,” Marianna Louca, 14, told Reuters in Lisbon.
Friday’s climate strikes are expected to take place in 2,300 cities in 153 countries around the world, according to the climate campaign group Friday For Future.
It comes as experts have warned that global temperatures could rise sharply this century with destructive consequences after greenhouse gas emissions hit record levels.
Dozens of young people gathered in Bangkok for a climate strike in solidarity with others around the world, chanting: “No more coal, no more oil, keep the carbon in the soil.”
In Warsaw, activists, some in gas masks, waved banners saying: “Save our planet” and “Poland without coal 2030”.
In Berlin, protesters in swimming costumes dived into the chilly river Spree, holding up a white box in a symbolic attempt to rescue the government’s climate change package.
Activists protested at Amazon sites around France, using the annual Black Friday shopping frenzy to denounce what they said was the destructive effect of rampant consumerism, in a backlash against the event driven in part by environmental concerns.
Several dozen protesters staged a dawn sit-in outside an Amazon building in the Clichy district of Paris, holding a sign saying: “No to Amazon and its world.”
In Australia, students in Sydney and other cities walked out of class, saying more should be done to combat the country’s bushfire crisis, which many see as a result of climate change.
Australia has for weeks been battling wildfires, which have killed at least four people, burnt about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroyed more than 500 homes.
Holding home-made signs, including “The climate is changing, why aren’t we?”, demonstrators in Sydney accused the government of inadequate action in addressing the bushfire crisis. Smoke from bushfires in New South Wales state formed a haze overhead.
“Our government’s inaction on the climate crisis has supercharged bushfires,” said 18-year-old Shiann Broderic, one of the event’s organisers, whose home was destroyed in a bushfire.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has rejected suggestions his government is not doing enough on climate change.
Australia has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2030, but recent data shows emissions are unchanged.

Shalfa Avrila Sania, 17, had been due to leave for the biennial Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines on Nov. 26 until she was dismissed suddenly from the training in mid-November, her lawyer and family said.
“The coach said my daughter always goes out late with her male friends and their interrogation showed she was no longer a virgin,” her mother Ayu Kurniawati told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Indonesia‘s East Java province.
“I was shocked. I want my daughter’s name cleared,” the mother-of-two added.
Indonesia‘s sports ministry denied the claim on Friday, saying the dismissal was due to performance and disciplinary issues.
“We will take firm action if the athlete was sent back due to questions over her virginity because this is a matter of privacy, dignity and has nothing to do with performance,” it said in a statement according to Indonesia‘s Detik news website.
Kurniawati said her daughter had won nearly 50 medals since she took up the sport when she was eight, and rejected doubts over her performance.
The family has sent a letter to the ministry to protest her dismissal alongside a medical report that showed her hymen was intact, their lawyer Imam Muklas said by phone.
Parts of Indonesia – the world’s most populous Muslim country – remain conservative and some still value female virginity highly, although pre-marital sex is not uncommon among the younger generation.
Human rights groups have previously opposed “virginity tests” on Indonesian women seeking to join the police or military, saying the practice was unscientific and degrading.
Other attempts to introduce virginity tests on students in some Indonesian schools faced opposition, including from among Islamic clerics.

213,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/mris-of-dense-breasts-find-more-cancer-but-also-false-alarms/,"Giving women with very dense breasts an MRI scan in addition to a mammogram led to fewer missed cancers but also to a lot of false alarms and treatments that might not have been needed, a large study found.
The results give a clearer picture of the tradeoffs involved in such testing, but they can’t answer the biggest question — whether it saves lives.

For women with dense breasts trying to decide on screening, “the dilemma remains,” Dr Dan Longo of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote in an editorial published with the study on Wednesday.
About half of women over 40 have dense breasts and about 10% have very dense ones. That raises their risk of developing cancer and makes it harder to spot on mammograms if they do. US regulators are making rules to require that women get breast density information when they have mammograms, and many places provide it now. But what to do if you have dense breasts is unclear — it’s not known if more or different types of screening such as MRIs or ultrasounds help.
The study involved more than 40,000 Dutch women ages 50 to 75 with very dense breasts who had normal results from a mammogram, a screening X-ray offered every two years in the Netherlands. About 8,000 of them also were offered an MRI scan, which uses powerful magnets to create detailed images, and 4,783 women agreed.
Researchers then tracked how many breast cancers were detected in each group within two years. Finding more of these “interval cancers” implies that the initial screening may have missed them.
The rate of these cancers after two years was twice as high in the group that was only offered mammograms. This suggests that adding MRIs to initial screening did catch more cancers, but they also gave a lot of false alarms— about 80 per 1,000 scans. Three-quarters of women who had a biopsy after a questionable MRI turned out not to have cancer.
MRIs also led to more side effects during the scan or later testing, such as fainting or problems from an IV. And they cost much more than mammograms.
The study only looked at the first two years of screening with MRIs and it’s too soon to say whether the test will save lives.
Without such evidence, it’s tough to say what value there is in finding more cancers, especially many very small, early-stage ones, Longo wrote. Doctors already know that some of these will never cause symptoms or become life-threatening.
“Our dilemma is that, for most tumours, we cannot tell the difference between cancers that can kill you and those that cannot,” he wrote.

214,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/going-green-does-offsetting-carbon-emissions-count/,"
LONDON: Among the most hotly contested topics at international climate change talks in Madrid on December 2-13 will be the role of market-based mechanisms for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon offsets.
WHAT IS OFFSETTING AND WHY IS IT A TRICKY TOPIC?
Carbon offsetting allows a country to help reach its own emissions reduction targets by funding emission reductions in another country. Companies are also increasingly using carbon credits to offset their emissions.
The first major offsetting scheme, the UN’s clean development mechanism (CDM), was set up under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, in which 190 countries agreed to country-by-country emission reduction targets.
The scheme was designed to help fund emission reduction projects in developing countries, while also providing offset credits to the developed world to help meet its Kyoto targets.
Negotiators in Madrid are set to discuss what kind of offsets, if any, should be used to meet the targets set out in the 2015 Paris agreement and how they should be monitored, following some cases where emissions cuts did not materialise.
The issue of which country claims the emission reduction will also need to be thrashed out, to avoid double counting.
WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS QUALIFY?
Carbon offset schemes cover all greenhouse gases but are measured in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent and can be awarded carbon credits.
More than 8,100 projects in 111 countries have registered with the CDM scheme, which has handed out over 2 billion carbon credits, called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), representing 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide reduction.
Projects registered under the scheme range from capturing and using methane gasses in pig manure to create electricity to replacing traditional wood and coal-burning cookstoves with cleaner alternatives such as ethanol. Offsets can be bought by individuals, companies or countries.
WHAT ABOUT CARBON SINKS?
Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation, or REDD+, allows developing nations to earn carbon credits, which they can sell, when they reduce deforestation and degradation or conserve, rehabilitate and replant forests.
To qualify, carbon credits from REDD+ projects must be approved by the UNs Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
DO THEY WORK?
Proponents say offsetting can channel much-needed climate finance to developing countries.
Critics say offsetting emissions reduces incentives for the drastic emissions cuts needed to slow global warming and does not always bring the intended benefits; for instance, new trees may not grow as quickly as promised.

215,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/greenhouse-gases-surge-to-record-in-2018-exceeding-10-yr-average-rate-un/,"
GENEVA: Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit a new record in 2018, rising faster than the average rise of the last decade and cementing increasingly damaging weather patterns, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Monday.
The UN agency’s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin is one of a series of studies to be published ahead of a UN climate change summit being held in Madrid next week and is expected to guide discussions there. It measures the atmospheric concentration of the gases responsible for global warming, rather than emissions.

“There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases’ concentration in the atmosphere – despite all the commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.
“This continuing long-term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea-level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems.”
The concentration of carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels that is the biggest contributor to global warming, surged from 405.5 parts per million in 2017 to 407.8 ppm in 2018, exceeding the average rate of increase of 2.06 ppm in 2005-2015, the WMO report said.
Irrespective of future policy, carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for centuries, locking in warming trends.
“It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago,” Taalas said.
Levels of methane – a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 – and nitrous oxide also hit new records, the report said.
The UN Environment Programme’s annual “emissions gap” report, due on Tuesday, assesses whether countries’ emissions reduction policies are enough.

Cold wave sweeping across Tarai has hit life hard in Bara district.
Due to freezing cold, schools in the district will remain closed for three days starting from December 22. The incessant cold wave has hit children, elderly and daily wage earners the most.
Health workers in the district have urged the locals to wear warm clothes and stay indoors except when there is an emergency. Rabindra Singh, a medical doctor, has advised the locals to consult a doctor when sick and stay warm.
The cold wave has adversely affected life in Bara’s Simara, Kaliaya, Kolhawi, Prasauni, Haraiya and Simraungadh. Sudden change in the weather pattern has adversely affected not only farmers but also traders. Mithu Khadka complained that they were having a hard time tending cattle
and doing regular work owing to the freezing cold.
According to Kolhabi Municipality, it has provided firewood for poor and needy people of the Dalit settlements to kindle fire so as to beat the bone-chilling cold.
Jitpursimara Sub-metropolitan City Mayor Dr Krishna Poudel said they had faced the shortage of firewood to supply in cold-affected areas.
Bara Chief District Officer Phadindramani Pokhrel said no human casualty was reported due to the cold as of yet.

Community schools in Saptakoshi Municipality have closed for five days after cold wave affected life in Saptari.
As many as 11 community schools, including secondary schools in the municipality, have been closed till Monday, effective from today.
Education Department Chief at the municipality Ram Dev Chaudhary said the decision was made after few students attended classes and the cold wave directly affected students’ health. He said most students, who were studying in schools, were from Dalit and poor background.
“We have decided to close the schools aiming to save the children from cold as the children did not have warm clothes,” he added.
Students in private and other community schools of other districts attending classes also have fallen ill due to excessive cold. Thick fog since early morning has affected life. With the cold increasing, activities in the main market places of the district have also declined. The markets also open late in the morning and close early due to the cold. Excessive cold has hit children, elderly citizens and daily wages workers.
Health workers said the number of cold-related patients have also increased in health facilities. They added that patients suffering from common cold, fever and asthma, among other maladies, had reached the health facilties for treatment.

Farmers in Ramechhap involved in kiwi farming have lamented the lack of market to sell their produce.
A large number of farmers in the district have adopted kiwi farming, but as there is lack of market, they are forced to sell their produce at  half the usual price.
“Last year, we had sold our produce for up to Rs 300 per kg, but this year we’re selling it at Rs 125 per kg. We still lack traders willing to buy our produce,” said farmer Pradip Sunuwar of Rasnalu in Gokulganga Rural Municipality-3. “Farmers near the road have managed to sell their produce, but the farmers in the inner village areas haven’t been able to sell their produce thus far,” he added.
Done only in some upper belts of the district initially, kiwi farming has become popular throughout the entire district now. Among others, Gokulganga, Umakunda and Doramba are the local bodies where kiwi farming is done commercially.
With the government helping farmers involved in Kiwi farming in recent years, more and more farmers have been attracted to it.
Kiwi farming is viable at an altitude between 800 and 2,400 metres. After a sapling is planted, it starts bearing fruits after three to four years. According to Yam Bahadur Moktan, a farmer  of Daduwa, a kiwi plant will continue to bear fruits up to 50 years.

“We’ve been continuously helping refugees residing in Jhapa and Morang since 1990, and we’ve completed most of our work,” said Fansa.
“We won’t do anything from the upcoming year and return by handing over the remaining refugees to the Nepal government,” added Fansa.
“Regarding the remaining refugees, we have reached arrangements on their shelter and food, and signed contracts with local schools for the education of refugee kids,” said UNHCR Damak programme coordinator Jamesh Mando.
Similarly, while refugee women and youths have been provided various income generating trainings, agreements have been reached with Damak Hospital and AMDA for treatment facility for the refugees. For drinking water, the UNHCR has built a 100,000 litre capacity water tank targeting the refugees.

Dhankuta, December 19 
Most community schools in Dhankuta were found to be charging fees from students in the name of English medium education though the government has declared free education up to secondary level.
The schools collected fees from students at the time of admission saying that teaching-learning activities would be carried out in English. The authority concerned chose to stay mum. Community schools took fees from children as per their classes like in private schools. The schools also charged students for providing educational materials such as copies, pencils, among other materials.
The schools also collected fees from students to pay for water and electricity bills and salary of teachers managed through private sources.
Community schools in the district collected Rs 1,000 from students who preferred admissions in English-taught Grade VIII and IX classes. Students from Grade I to VIII pay somewhere between Rs 100 to 700 during admission.
Head teacher Yagya Prasad Chapagain in Gokundeshwor Secondary School, Siranbazaar, said the school took fees as per agreement with the guardians. “It is difficult to release the salary to the teachers of private sources as there is no other source of income,” he added. Chapagain said the school took
annual fees (Rs 100 to 175) from students of Grade I to V, Rs 700 from students of Grade VI and VII and Rs 900 to Rs 1000 from students of Grade VIII to X.
Another head teacher Ram Bahadur Dhakal at Ram Secondary School, Rambazaar Leguwa, said the school would not take any fee from guardians if the state managed all the expenditure of classes taught in English-medium, physical infrastructure, teacher quota, among other facilities. A head teacher, Damodar Mishra, at Gokundeshwor Balmandir Secondary School, Tallokopchhe, said the schools took fees to promote the education standard.
The number of students increased in community schools after the schools introduced teaching-learning activities in English medium. There are 291 community schools in the district.

A teacher at Pokhara-based Amarsingh Secondary School faced action for committing sexual violence against his student.
According to school sources, Udayaraj Pokharel, a permanent teacher also teaching Plus-two classes in the morning, had misbehaved with an eleventh grader in the education stream. Following mounting pressure from students, the school administration and management committee today took action against Pokharel.
According to Principal Tejaswi Baral, the teacher won’t be allowed to take plus-two classes any more. He teaches Social Studies up to Grade X and Pedagogy in the plus-two level.
According to the victim, she had to expose the teacher after the latter harassed her by sending sexually explicit photos on her Facebook account.
Though students had reported the violence to the school on Monday itself, as nothing happened, the angry students had walked out of their classrooms today morning.
According to Principal Tejaswi Baral, talks were held between the school management committee, school administration, guardians and students today to discuss the matter.
“Though the teacher concerned said he was ready to apologise for his unbecoming act, students refused to accept him as teacher, so we’ve decided to relieve him from the teacher’s position in the morning session,” said the principal.
It is important to note that though similar complaints of sexual violence against girls had been reported to the school administration earlier too, he had always managed to get away with his unbecoming acts.
Pokhara metropolis Education Division chief Ganga Bahadur Gurung, on his part, said his office so far hasn’t received even a single case related to sexual violence.
“Generally, we monitor other things but hardly inquire about an issue such as this. We are ready to take action against teachers involved in sexual violence and the school concerned should anyone approach with a complaint,” he said.

The offices were padlocked over a dispute stemming from the election schedule published after conclusion of Dhankuta CCI’s 45th general assembly.
The lockout was first done by entrepreneurs espousing communist ideology on December 9, seeking that election be held only after distributing new memberships. Separately, on December 16, other entrepreneurs supporting democratic ideology also hung their own padlock on the CCI office.
Though there have been frequent meetings with the disputing parties at the initiative of Chief District Officer Krishna Bahadur Ghimire, the issue is yet to be resolved.
“As entrepreneurs carrying different ideologies stuck to their guns, no consensus could be reached,” said the CDO, clarifying that breaking the lock open was beyond the administration’s jurisdiction.
“This is a matter related to the CCI, so the same body must resolve it. We don’t want to be dragged into the dispute unnecessarily,” said the CDO.
Meanwhile, with the lockout on the main gate where the CCI is based continuing, the same has affected the scheduled election of the CCI. It has also affected daily work of Youth Self-employment Office housed in the same building.

254,https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/tie-up-with-rjp-n-to-benefit-ncp-in-province-2/,"Kathmandu, December 19
The ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP)’s decision to forge alliance with Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal to secure two seats in the forthcoming National Assembly election is aimed at pitting RJP-N and Samajwadi Party-Nepal against each other and making it impossible for the Nepali Congress to join hands with these parties for electoral gains.
President of Nepal Democracy Foundation Jay Nishant said the two-point agreement signed between the NCP and the RJP-N yesterday has sent jitters across Province 2, where the RJP-N and the SP-N run coalition government. “But, I do not think this agreement could serve as the ground for long-term partnership or collaboration between the two parties,” he added.
RJP-N, which had extended outside support to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, withdrew it last year accusing the government of not doing anything to address the party’s demands, including the issue of constitution amendment.
RJP-N had held rounds of unity talks with SP-N in recent months, but stopped the process lately saying the SP-N was not ready to quit the government, a pre-condition for unity.
Nishant said NCP chose to forge NA poll alliance with RJP-N, mainly to achieve three goals — to maintain equidistance with RJP-N and SP-N, create rift between these two parties by opportunistically playing favouritism with them and make it impossible for the NC to collaborate with RJP-N and SP-N. He said the NCP’s motive to sign the agreement was also guided by its effort to remain the largest political force in Province 2.
Political analyst Chandra Kishore, however, said the two-point agreement would harm RJP-N in Madhes where people voted for the party mainly to champion the cause of constitution amendment.
“This agreement does not say anything about constitution amendment. People of Madhes voted RJP-N not to send its leaders to the NA but to secure amendment to the constitution,” he argued. He said the RJP-N risked losing political grounds in Madhes by signing the two-point agreement with the NCP, whom it had treated as political bête noire.  “As long as Lalu Yadav of Bihar and Mawati of UP remained committed to the empowerment of deprived and marginalised communities, they ruled their states. The day they indulged in nepotism and favouritism, they lost their vote bank. RJP-N may suffer the same fate,” he argued.
Another political analyst Tula Narayan Shah said RJP-N’s decision to forge NA poll alliance with the NCP exposed its double standards as it had been saying that unity was possible with SP-N only when the latter quit the government.
“This deal can be a ground for the RJP-N to collaborate more with the NCP in the future. I won’t be surprised if the SP-N is expelled from NCP-led government at the centre and if the RJP-N and SP-N part their ways in Province 2 where they have coalition government at present,” said Shah.
Asked to comment on the agreement, SP-N Chair Upendra Yadav, who is Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, said he was not surprised by the deal. NCP did not forge alliance with his party because for NCP sealing a deal with SP-N would have become very difficult.
He said he was not worried about the prospect of RJP-N and NCP collaborating more in the days ahead.

An international court has directed the Nepal government not to impose capital gains tax on Ncell buyout deal for the time being – a decision that could bring the process of collecting Rs 22.4 billion from the largest private telecom company to a grinding halt.
The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes today issued an interim order directing the government, including the Inland Revenue Department and Large Taxpayers’ Office, not to “take any steps” to enforce its decision to collect Rs 22.4 billion in outstanding capital gains tax, including interest and penalties, from the sale of Ncell by TeliaSonera Norway to Axiata UK. Axiata had acquired 80 per cent stake in Ncell for $1.4 billion in April 2016.
The interim order was issued on the basis of arbitration proceedings initiated by Axiata Investments (UK) and Ncell against the Nepal government.
“The ICSID Convention is not clear on whether interim measures will have binding effect. But previous tribunals have made provisional measures binding for parties involved in ICSID cases,” said Semanta Dahal, a lawyer, who has been closely following the case.
This indicates the government may have to suspend its plan to collect outstanding taxes from Ncell.
It is not known when the US-based court will issue a final order in the case.
“If the final verdict is issued in line with today’s order, the Nepal government will not only be barred from collecting outstanding capital gains tax but will have to reimburse whatever capital gains tax it has collected from Ncell in the past,” said Dahal.
The final verdict issued by an international arbitration court, according to Dahal, will be binding for the Nepal government and failure to enforce it may prompt the court to seize and auction Nepal’s assets abroad to compensate the plaintiff.

Axiata Investments (UK) and Ncell moved the international dispute settlement court in April after Large Taxpayers’ Office asked Ncell to foot the capital gains tax bill of Rs 62.63 billion on Ncell buyout deal. At that time, Ncell had already paid Rs 23.57 billion to the government, but tax authorities were exerting pressure on the company to settle outstanding tax liability of Rs 39.06 billion immediately. Since then, the company has moved the Supreme Court and outstanding tax liability has been reduced to Rs 22.4 billion.
Although a part of the outstanding tax has already been paid, Axiata and Ncell have been saying that “the act of imposing CGT” in connection with the Ncell buyout deal “contravenes Nepal’s international law obligations under the 1993 Nepal-UK Bilateral Investment Treaty”. “This means Axiata and Ncell are not happy that the CGT has been imposed on buyers and not sellers, which is against the global practice.” This is the reason for moving the international court.
Axiata and Ncell have appointed Albert Jan van den Berg, a Dutch national, to represent them at the international court. Nepal was previously asked to appoint its own lawyer. But it did not do so. So, in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, the chairman of the administrative council of the ICSID, appointed Paul Friedland, a US citizen, to represent Nepal in the legal case, says the ICSID website.
“This indifferent attitude towards appointing the lawyer has made Nepal’s position very weak,” said Dahal.
But the Large Taxpayers’ Office is not worried.
“The lawsuit refers to provisions in the 1993 Nepal-UK Bilateral Investment Treaty. But that treaty only covers issues related to investment, whereas the issue raised by Axiata and Ncell in the international court is related to taxation,” said Jhalak Ram Adhikari, chief tax administrator at the LTO. “International courts cannot intervene in taxation affairs of a sovereign country. So, we will follow the Supreme Court’s order to collect taxes from Ncell.”

The Bill Session of the Parliament beginning tomorrow is likely to be stormy, with the opposition planning to raise issues related to Kalapani, ‘controversial’ bills, Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact Programme, Constitutional Council and Gokarna Forest Resort.

A meeting of the parliamentary party of the main opposition Nepali Congress this afternoon decided to seek the prime minister’s clarification on the government’s failure to take necessary political and diplomatic steps regarding Nepal-India border issue in the Kalapani region.
A recent political map released by India has depicted the Kalapani region — Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani — as Indian territory. Following the publication of the map, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had called an all-party meeting where he had expressed commitment to resolve the issue through diplomatic and political initiatives. “NC President
Sher Bahadur Deuba had pledged his party’s full support to any government initiative to resolve the issue, but the prime minister has failed to take any initiative,” said NC Whip Pushpa Bhusal. “The NC demands the PM’s clarification in the Parliament,” added Bhusal.
The NC also expressed reservation over controversial bills the government has tabled in the Parliament, including the Bill to Amend and Integrate Laws related to Constitution
and Operation of Nepal Special Service.
Terming the bill ‘against the spirit of the constitution’, the NC has demanded its withdrawal.
Bhusal said the bill violates citizens’ fundamental right, as it proposes to give powers to National Investigation Department to wiretap phones and to intercept digital communications of individuals. “The bill curbs civil liberties and right to privacy.”
Referring to the government’s recent bid to introduce an ordinance related to the amendment to the Constitutional Council Act, the NC said it would not allow passage of any such bills that violated constitutional provisions and parliamentary practice. “The government is planning to negate the opposition while appointing officials to constitutional commissions,” said Bhusal. “The NC will not accept such moves.” Deuba this morning met Oli at the latter’s residence in Baluwatar where Deuba conveyed the NC’s position to the PM regarding the Constitutional Council.
The NC also raised the government’s attention towards the need to endorse the MCC Compact Programme from the Parliament at the earliest. “The then government led by Deuba had signed the MCC agreement with the US to expedite development works,” said NC lawmaker Dila Sangroula. “However, there are reports that ruling party lawmakers are against it. So we demand the MCC’s endorsement at the earliest.”
Another issue the NC has raised is politicking in universities and making appointments based on political loyalty. The NC has warned the government against violating academic freedom of universities.
Other issues the NC plans to raise include the government’s bid to bring the Policy Research Institute under the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers and the government’s move to lease out Gokarna Forest Resort to Yeti Group.
“Our presentation in the Bill session of the Parliament will revolve around these issues,” said Sangroula.
Tomorrow’s inaugural session, which will be presided over by Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe in the absence of speaker, will see addresses from PM Oli and Deuba. The speaker’s post has remained vacant since Krishna Bahadur Mahara was arrested over attempt to rape charge.

Factionalism-riddled Nepali Congress postponed the meeting of its central working committee yet again as talks between warring factions got stuck over the number of office bearers in Nepal Student’s Union, the party’s student’s wing.
Camps led by senior Nepali Congress leader Ramchandra Paudel and Krishna Prasad Sitaula have united to boycott the central working committee meet raising four issues — devising a calendar for the 14th national convention, increasing the number of party departments from 28 to 41, constitution of the Nepal Students Union and extension of tenure of Tarun Dal’s central working committee.
The two sides — the other being the establishment faction led by Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba — have already agreed on issues related to the national convention calendar, party departments, extension of tenure of Tarun Dal’s office bearers and leadership of the NSU. Only the number of office bearers in the NSU remains to be resolved.
Therefore, today’s central working committee meet was postponed until Friday as the talks needed some more time, said NC Spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma. “Since both the sides have agreed to move ahead on the basis of consensus, forging consensus is taking time,” he said.
Meanwhile, both the factions today held separate meetings to devise further strategy. While Paudel and Sitaula camps assembled at Paudel’s residence at Boharatar, the Deuba camp assembled at Deuba’s residence in Budhanilkantha.
Party insiders say since agreement has already been forged on major contentious issues, the present stalemate was a result of the two sides playing political one-upmanship at the expense of the party.
Insiders say Deuba dropped the idea of moving ahead on the basis of majority and decided to forge consensus to ensure that the issues raised by the Paudel camp were finished once and for all and the Paudel faction was rendered issueless.
On the other hand, the Paudel camp wants keep some issues unresolved to use them as bargaining tool in the future. “This attitude is only going to weaken the party,” the leader said.

The agitating youths have also sought an investigation into the irregularities through a high-level probe panel.
“The municipality hasn’t done even 700,000 rupees worth of work and showed 2 million rupees as expenditure.
We approached the office seeking information related to public interest by citing the constitutional right, waited for 10 days and then padlocked it four days ago and still no result, which is why we had to agitate,” said local Krishnanand Yadav. Further, they have warned of stern agitation if the municipality continues to refuse to address their demands.

The ADB-funded Regional Urban Development Project had started construction of a systematic road network in four local levels of the Far-West — Dhangadhi Sub-Metropolitan City, Godawari Municipality in Kailali, and Bhimdutta Municipality and Shuklaphanta Municipality in Kanchanpur district.
However, the project has come to a standstill due to a dispute between the donor and the government.
Following the government decision to take action against construction companies who have delayed construction projects or have the history of subpar work, the Public Procurement Monitoring Office has started preparation to prosecute the contractor company, Raman JV, technical proposal of which were selected for the road construction in all four local levels. No financial proposal has been submitted for any projects.
The Office has moved forward with the process to put Raman JV in the blacklist. 
“The construction company cannot take part in the public procurement process as the case against the company is still under consideration,” the Office said. However, ADB has stressed that technical proposal submitted by Raman JV must be approved as the decision to blacklist the company is yet to be taken.

Process following the submission of technical proposal has been stopped owing to dispute between the two bodies, informed Engineer Shyam Chandra Budhathoki, source person at Project Implementation Unit.
“The process to move ahead with the construction is not in our hands,” engineer Budhathoki said while adding, “it will remain uncertain until the finalisation of the proceeding against Raman JV by the Public Procurement Monitoring Office.”
A proposal had been called last fiscal by the donor to construct 10.25-km road in Dhangadhi, 15.56-km in Godavari and 5-km in Shuklaphanta including the process to blacktop Dhangadi Traffic Chauraha-Kailali Nala road section, Sahid Gate-Campus road section, Gulma-Church road, Malpot road and Divot-Pipal Chautara road section. Raman JV had been selected for the same.

The project has allocated the budget of Rs 1.1 billion in Dhangadhi, Rs 770.3 million in Godawari and Rs 311.7 million in Shuklaphata.
Similarly, the technical proposal by Raman JV for the construction of road in Bhimdutta Municipality of Kanchanpur under the same project has already been evaluated and is awaiting the submission of financial proposal.

She visited the District Hospital, Bajura and various pharmaceuticals in the hope of finding a cure to her health problems, but to no avail. Recently, she visited the Ayurved Health Centre and underwent treatment there, following which she has started feeling better.
Nepali said, “I have started to feel well again after undergoing treatment at the Ayurved Centre for the first time. I feel much better than how I did before. I had to pay for the Out Patient Department (OPD) ticket at the hospital and also for the medicines. However, everything at the Centre is free of cost, which is an added benefit.”
Deepak Sunar, an employee at the Forest Division Office, Bajura has a similar story to tell. Sunar shared that he had been suffering from backache for which he visited medical shops and took medicines. Not feeling any improvement in his condition, he went to the Ayurved Centre and underwent treatment there. “I feel well after undergoing the ayurvedic treatment,” said Sunar.


There was a time when there were no patients at the Centre. Many were not even aware of the alternative treatment that the District Ayurved Health Centre carried out. Employees there would be seen basking in the sun in lack of patients and work.
However, the circumstance has changed now. Central member of the Federation of Non-government Organisations in the district, Kashi BK, said many people come to the Centre now seeking treatment of their conditions.
The Centre is giving health services to the locals free of cost. According to Dikshya Bhandari, acting chief at the Centre, in an average, 15 patients visit the Centre for treatment on a daily basis. “The number of patients have considerably increased, possibly owing to the fact that they feel improvement in their conditions post treatment here. Rise in the number of patients could also be attributed to promotion and improved management.”
Various kinds of health conditions are treated at the Centre such as arthritis, digestive problems including gastritis, pulmonary illnesses, cough and cold, sinusitis, piles, skin diseases, gynaecological problems, hypertension, among others, added Bhandari.
Additionally, the Centre is also providing ayurvedic supplements to lactating mothers to increase milk supply and mineral supplements to elderly citizens.
Deputy mayor of Badimalika Municipality Kabita Bista said that she has also been visiting the Ayurved Centre for treatment and has received good results.
There is a lack of awareness in the district regarding this form of treatment, and after much effort, people’s attention has been drawn towards it. Acting chief Bhandari stated that further steps would be taken to inform people at the local levels about Ayurvedic treatment and its benefits.

The government has completed the environment impact assessment of the proposed electricity-powered railway in Province 1.
The assessment of the Inaruwa-Kakadbhitta (106.59km) and Biratnagar-Itahari railways (20.16km) under the East-West Railways was carried out by Nepal Railway Department. The estimated cost of the railways stands somewhere at 90.0282 billion rupees.
As per the study, developing the railways would entail acquisition of some 635.77 hectare land. Of the total land thus needed, 512 hectare is arable land, while 19.60 hectare is forest land. Another 33 hectare is land occupied by human settlements.
Around 4,000 families will be affected by construction of the railways.
According to Rikesh Chitrakar, an expert involved in the EIA-related work of the railways, the Kakadbhitta-Inaruwa railway will start from Kakadbhitta and end at Janata Chowk of Inaruwa bazaar and run parallel to the East-West highway from 2km south. While there will be 10 stations between Inaruwa and Kakadbhitta, one such station will be built between Biratnagar and Itahari.
At present, construction of the railways from Bathanah to Katahari is under way with Indian assistance. The link railway to be constructed by Nepal will take over from Katahari and link the line to Itahari station through Hattimuda. The proposed railway touches three local bodies of Jhapa, nine of Morang and three of Sunsari.

A staffer in Rautahat District Administration Office, Ram Naresh Sah, said that notice had been issued requesting district dwellers not come out of their houses, to wear warm clothes and sit around the fire.
Chief District Officer Krishna Sah appealed to the people to stay warm. He said patients of pneumonia, asthma, cold, fever and high blood pressure have to be extra careful.
Shyam Kumar Mahato, a teacher  at Golbazaar Municipality said that less number of children had attended schools due to the cold. He said many parents and guardians did not send their wards to schools as small children could not take care of themselves.
Rudal Sadaya, a worker at Golbazaar said he could not go to the work due to the cold wave. “I could not go to work for the last five days due to thick fog since early morning,” he said. Sadaya said that it was very difficult to run the family.
According to Siraha District Health Office, patients suffering from common cold, diarrhoea, and asthma among other cold-related diseases had increased in the health facilities.

The government of Karnali Province has launched its ‘Bank Account for Daughters, Life-long Security’ programme from today.
Karnali Province Chief Minister Mahendra Bahadur Shahi unveiled the programme by handing over cheques bearing an amount of Rs 1000 to Darshana Damai’s four-month-old daughter Janaki and Ratana Sunar’s two-month-old daughter Jamuna to open bank accounts in their names, in Kalikot’s district headquarters Manma today.

Addressing the programme launch ceremony today, the chief minister described the programme as a special one geared towards ensuring social justice for daughters.
The programme, mentioned in the provincial government’s programmes and policies for this fiscal, has now been implemented in Kalikot after a procedure for the same was devised. It will be implemented in other districts in the province too gradually. The programme will be applicable for girls born from the start of the current fiscal.
Families wanting to join the programme will have to apply to the local bodies concerned for the same by submitting necessary documents.
The facility, however, will be applicable to two daughters tops borne to the same parents. In case of girls without parents and raised by others, there is no limit on how the number of girls entitled to the facility.
As per the programme, the provincial government will provide Rs 1000 as an initial fund to open an account and deposit an additional fund of Rs 500 every month thenceforth. The provincial government, however, can change the additional amounts to be thus deposited on a monthly basis as per necessity.
Such amount to be deposited will be released through local bodies and the total fund and the interest on it thus accumulated, estimated to be to the tune of 200,000 rupees in twenty years, cannot be withdrawn until the child is 20.
There are some conditions for claiming the facility. For one, only girls whose families can provide them education up to secondary level are entitled to the facility. Similarly, a girl wishing to claim the benefit of the programme cannot marry till the age of 20 years.
To claim the amount, the concerned family must apply to the local body concerned with documents vouching that the girl concerned has crossed 20 years of age and has completed secondary education.
At the programme today, Social Development Minister Dal Rawal conveyed the provincial government’s commitment to developing human capital and said, “Around 38.4 million rupees has been handed over to local bodies in the first instalment of the programme for girls born this fiscal,” he said.
Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister and provincial government Spokesperson Bimala KC said the launch of the programme had given most happiness to her in her life. “I’m confident that this programme will end the current trend of selective abortion, gender-based violence and child marriage,” she said.

A girl from Jajarkot, who had gone missing from her home, has been rescued after seven years.
Kalpana Thapa of Karuka, Barekot Rural Municipality-5, was rescued from New Delhi by Tamana Sister of Charity, an Indian organisation working in the field of service to humanity and serving as a shelter for missing women.
A team of the organisation brought Kalpana to Jajarkot district headquarters Khalanga and handed her over to her brother Mahendra Thapa today.
The rescued girl was handed over to her kin in the presence of the rural municipality Vice-chairperson Oma Kumari Shahi, acting Chief Administrative Officer Govind Bahadur Singh, among others.
“She was found in May 2017 at a hospital in Guragaun of New Delhi by police and handed over to an old age home. She approached us last year. Found in shaky mental condition, she was treated for a year or so at our shelter before she gained her mental health and has now been brought here,” said the leader of the team, Sister Manjusa.
Barekot-5 Ward Member Bhakta Bahadur Basnet said it’d been seven years since Kalpana had gone  missing. “Her real name is Devi Thapa. She used to leave her home earlier as well before she finally disappeared,” he said.
On the occasion today, the rural municipality Vice-chair Shahi extended her thanks to the Tamana Sister of Charity, Manager Janak Sharma of Caritas Nepal regional office, Nepalgunj and Youth Awareness Development Centre Nepal programme Coordinator Sahadev Basnet for bringing the missing girl home.

276,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/safety-issues-and-challenges-for-women-in-public-transport/,"KATHMANDU: Do men feel the same level of discomfort and awkwardness when they are mistakenly or intentionally touched by a stranger in a public space, especially during a public commute, as women do?
Many people living in a metropolitan city may have at least one story to tell about having gone through such discomfort in a closed public space. While some of such stories fade away with time and are eventually forgotten, others remain ingrained in a person’s memory- sometimes resurfacing, voluntarily suppressed the next moment.
People, mostly women, face various levels of sexual harassment in public transportation which are rarely expressed and even if they are little or nothing is done about it. Incidents involving a person violating another’s personal space and freedom to travel with peace of mind has become more frequent than it should.
Many such incidents ‘pass’ without much noise or notice given that public transports are crowded and with many unknown faces overfilling the cramped spaces. The discomfort and embarrassment, however, lingers on. The embarrassment which should have been felt by the perpetrator hits the wrong end. The withdrawal happens in a bid to avoid the attention of the crowd because we have for long been taught that even if we have been wronged, the shame is ours.
I was returning home from work one fine evening, standing by the bus window at the end space and the bus gradually became crowded. A while later, a girl quickly shifted towards me to stand by the window too. Behind her stood a man in a pale shirt. Only later did I realise that the man, who reeked of alcohol, had his eyes fixed on the girl and was advancing towards her.
I, with the girl, shifted away. However, that man who had every intention to sexually harass us shifted towards us. I told another passenger about what was going on. By then, the culprit had moved a bit further and shifted his gaze to another woman. The other guy that I sought help from asked this woman to stand in another corner and she shifted. All eyes were then on the harasser who then moved towards the bus door hesitantly.
Such perpetrators will act upon their needs, on their terms, without being at all concerned about anything else. And the victim in their hesitation will find themselves in a mental conflict about how to react. As witnesses, what we can at least try to do is consider what the victim would expect of us, or how we, if the roles were reversed, would expect others around us to act.
This is just one representative case and there are countless such cases. Such jarring incidents, which continue to occur frequently despite many debates and measures around the issue, make us question – when will a woman start feeling safe?
The aforementioned incident wherein people showed support to the intended-target of abuse may be viewed as one with a positive outcome. However, women do not always receive such support.
A woman, who wishes to remain unnamed, also a mother of two, shared how she had once witnessed harassment inside public transportation as a man laid his hands on her friend. She said her companion acted aggressively in response and the man spoke back indecently while no other passenger bothered to speak out in her favour.
Another woman, a regular traveller by bus, shared a similar story. “These things happen especially while you’re standing in a crowded bus when men standing behind you try to push you from behind while you can perceive their intention without an inch of doubt.” She added, “You ache to speak out or push back but instead end up doing nothing and wait for the congestion in the bus to loosen.”
Other common but not as widely discussed issue that women face while using public transport is manspreading.
Courtesy: Wikipedia
Manspreading, a term which was initially coined by women on online forums expressing dissent over a peculiar habit exhibited by men, has now been formalised by Oxford Dictionary.
The dictionary defines manspreading as the practice in which a man, especially on public transportation, takes a sitting position with his legs wide apart, in such a way as to encroach on an adjacent seat(s).
A man may not even realise the way he is seated or how it is bothering someone else. But a woman or any other passenger sitting next to a ‘manspreader’ will be discomforted by such clumsiness.
It is always best to speak out, react to inappropriate behaviour – whether molestation or manspreading – so that such behaviour doesn’t go unchecked.
However, that is easier said than done. A victim under such circumstances may find it difficult to react for various reasons, the most common reason being the fear of being misunderstood. In case a woman retaliates and demands some space, the other person takes it on their ego.
During one such incident where a woman asked for some space when a man got too close, things escalated to an extent where an elderly man came in defence of the fellow male passenger and pulled a satire that men and women should travel by different buses altogether.
The viability of such a scenario is certainly questionable on the ground of possibility. But shouldn’t there be a better way to tackle the situation where respect for fellow travellers comes naturally without being asked for?
Because basic civic sense is not so common, responsible state mechanisms could perhaps formulate regulations to protect commuters from sexual harassment in public transportation.
A decade or so ago, women and girls would not have spoken out for their reserved seat(s) in public transportation. But now, especially after the campaign to enforce the provision of reserved seats on public vehicles stated by the Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act, 2049 BS (1993 AD), the scenario has changed. It has to some extent safeguarded women and girls from the perpetrators of abuse.
There’s more that can be done. The solution lies inside the human mind and within human sensibility. The solution is multi-dimensional. Everyone has a role to play and a sentiment to understand. The main idea is to be open that it could happen to anyone and what we as individuals can do is speak out.

277,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/qr-code-payments-for-financial-inclusion/,"Having QR doesn’t just make payments simple, secure and affordable but also helps the government in generating more taxes, contributing to economic prosperity. To acquire QR code payments, a PAN number and bank account are required
With innovation in the payment systems in Nepal, people are shifting gears from cash to digital payments. Cash remains the king, as 97 per cent of the transactions are done through it; however, digital transactions are on the rise. Digital payments are faster and hassle-free. Digital payments are not just limited to card payments through Point of Sales (PoS) machines these days even in Nepal. People have started scanning QR through their smartphones, businesses have integrated the innovative payment system, and this is on the rise.

Quick Response (QR) code payments are an alternative to cash or debit/credit card payments. It is a contactless payment that is done by scanning the QR code using any mobile banking application, or digital wallet, which is part of the network. This avoids the use of expensive point of sale machines and cards. The customer can simply enter the required amount, remarks and PIN. In a few taps, the payment is done.
“I’ve been transacting through my mobile banking application and digital wallet in restaurants, department stores, and even petrol pumps. In less than 30 seconds my payment is done, and I don’t feel the need to carry loads of cash since these services have been introduced,” shares a customer. Moreover, with QR codes, there is no need to swipe a card as well. People have started saving money with its use as most QR merchants provide discounts and offers with every transaction.
Under the Fonepay network, there are 60,000 plus merchants throughout the nation, and 20,000 transactions take place every day. Around 300,000- 400,000 users are paying through the network daily. Restaurants in the city, such as Trishara, Dalle and Bota, provide attractive offers to customers who use QR systems to make payments. In businesses, such as Tranquility Spa, QR payments have surpassed the traditional card payments. QR payments offer up to 50 per cent discount.
“One in every four transactions is done through QR, and the customer flow has significantly increased after introducing QR payment offers,” says Rajesh Phaiju, administrator at Tranquility Spa.
QR code payments have reached across Nepal, covering the remote areas in the Himalaya, hills and Tarai. QR code payments have been acquired by small and medium-scale businesses in the nooks and crannies of the country. Okhaldhunga’s Gyan Katuwal, owner of Ganga Bijaya Wholesale Kirana Pasal, installed QR code payments a few months back. He shares that people are gradually shifting towards digital payments in the region. According to him, “QR code payments are quite easy to maintain and use. I do not have to install, maintain and operate a PoS machine.”
Similarly, Krishna Sharan Lama, the owner of White House View Point Restaurant, Dakshinkali has installed a QR payment system. “My restaurant is quite packed during the weekends, and many customers have inquired about QR payments,” he said. “So, I felt the urgency to integrate it into my business.” Since he started using these services, his customer’s needs for contactless payments have been met.
QR payments have also been accepted in social functions, such as weddings, and also at temples. When I recently visited Tal Barahi Temple in Pokhara, I observed that even it has started accepting QR payments, even Gods have started going digital in a way. I installed my QR code during my wedding reception, which made it possible for the guests to scan my QR and directly send cash to my account. This saved me from taking all the cash out of the envelope, counting them and depositing it into my account. Moreover, it is also a secure option as there is always a risk of losing cash during the rush of a traditional Nepali wedding.
However, acquisition of QR code payment systems doesn’t mean that people will use it right away. People have to be educated about how and why using QR payments are necessary. Having QR doesn’t just make payments simple, secure and affordable but also aids the government in generating more taxes. Now, this has a multiplier effect and contributes to economic prosperity. A Permanent Account Number (PAN) and bank account are required to acquire QR code payments for a business. This promotes financial inclusion, access and transparency. Our neighboring country, China, has adopted QR code payments religiously, even mom and pop stores, vegetable vendors, transport rental services use this technology to accept payments.
Moreover, even artists performing in the streets do not accept cash, instead they have their QR payment codes to accept payments. When someone makes payments using cash, they get odd stares in the streets of China. Some 92 per cent of people in China’s top cities used We Chat Pay or Alipay as their primary payment method as per Penguin Intelligence in 2017.
We can learn a lesson from the factory of the world, China, and promote digital payments through QR code payments in Nepal. Since we now have 8.4 million mobile banking subscribers, and it is increasing rapidly, this facilitates QR code payments. Moreover, digital wallets also facilitate these payments. The government must play a proactive role in enabling digital payments to enable transparency, financial inclusion, financial access and economic prosperity in the long run.

278,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-restore-services-soon/,"Removing the cables only after providing an alternative access to phone and internet services would have saved trouble for everyone
Bundles and bundles of wires and cables seen dangling from utility poles spaced every few metres in the streets of Kathmandu are an eyesore. They are a blot on the otherwise charming cityscape dotted with age-old temples and monuments framed against the snow-peaked mountains. In a bid to give the city a neater look, Kathmandu Metropolitan City is shaving off loops of wires and cables of landline telephone and internet services at different places of the capital. While the initiative to improve the city’s image is definitely welcome, one cannot rule out the disruption of telephone and internet services, which greatly inconveniences the locals. This is particularly so if the work is being carried out at a place where businesses are heavily concentrated, such as Thamel in the heart of the capital. The tourist hub is home to 6,000 businesses, ranging from hotels and restaurants to souvenir shops and massage parlours, and one can well imagine what any disruption in communication services does to their business.
It’s been more than four days since the Thamel Tourism Development Council (TTDC) launched the drive to make the tourist hub cleaner by removing the ugly wire and cable mesh. What it did not foresee was the problem this could cause to the local businesses. And the timing could not have been more inappropriate. The initiative was begun targeting the Visit Nepal Year 2020, which starts in less than two weeks, but Christmas and the New Year are also just round the corner when Thamel sees a lot of visitors, and the business volume goes up. Today’s tourists don’t carry much cash and all transactions are settled through digital payments, either with a debit and credit card or through Quick Response (QR) code payments. But to swipe the payment cards in a point of sales machine requires landline phone service. Hotels are  also having to face the wrath of their guests who are unable to communicate with their family members back home. The hotels as well as tour agencies are also unable to keep tab of online bookings and speak to their clients. With landline and internet service out of order already for days, the loss to businesses in Thamel could be staggering.
It is not known when the phone and internet services will be restored. There are speculations that it might take upto 10 days just to cut the wires. In today’s world, can any individual or business survive that long without communication services? The TTDC should have foreseen the problem and made arrangements so as not to disturb the local business environment. The TTDC has claimed it had held discussion with the stakeholders, including the businesses, Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the regulatory body, and internet service providers. However, the Internet Service Providers’ Association of Nepal has asserted it was not informed about the campaign, which shows lack of coordination among the different stakeholders. Removing the cables only after providing an alternative access to phone and internet services would have saved trouble for everyone. But the campaign to remove the dangling wires cannot be stopped midway now, and the only way to restore the communication links quickly is by speeding up the pace of work.

Rotavirus vaccine
The government is launching rotavirus vaccination for children below five years of age from June next year. Rotavirus is the most common cause of diarrhoea among children across the world. It is one of the most common illnesses among children and the major cause of childhood mortality in Nepal.
The vaccination prevents diarrhoea among children below five years of age. It will help reduce the death of children from diarrhoea, doctors at the Child Health and Immunisation Section at Family Welfare Division say. The government aims to vaccinate around 620,000 children against rotavirus in the first phase. The first dose of the vaccine should be given to a child when s/he is six months old and the next dose in ten months. It will be available in 16,000 health posts of the country. Prevalence of diarrhoea among children below five is eight per cent while six per cent below six months suffered from it. Nepal Health Sector Strategy 2016-21 targets are to reduce neonatal and under-five mortality to 17.5 and 28 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2021. The SDG targets related to neonatal and under-five mortality rate in Nepal are to reduce them to 12 and 20 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030.

279,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/message-of-south-asian-games/,"When nations are estranged from one another based on ideology, geography, nationality and religion, the magic power that brings this divided world together is international sports events, be they the World Cup, Olympics Games or South Asian Games. These events are usually organised for the purposes of maintaining fitness, enhancing relationships, humanity, brotherhood and equality among nations and people. While offering a platform for nations to display their skills, abilities and contributions in the field of sports, it also promotes unity, solidarity, cooperation, peace and harmony among nations.
Last week, the entire nation was in the grip of the thrilling 13th edition of the South Asian Games (SAG) held in Nepal. The 10-day SAG fair had created ample excitement, fun and enthusiasm among the people. Even though there were some grievances over the poor, incomplete and shoddy preparations, the entire event went on to become a grand success. With Nepal winning an unprecedented 206 medals, including a rich haul of 51 gold medals to finish second in the medal tally, the success was historic.
However, it is distressing to note that poor promotion of the SAG had kept many people away from the competitions; women footballers were forced to play at the Pokhara Stadium, which did not have a dressing room; and vital preparations were being carried out till the last minute in the capital. Although the authorities had three years to complete the preparations for the SAG, the sluggishness with which they were being carried out till the final hours sent a bad message. It is sad to learn that due to lack of proper sporting equipment and gear, some Nepali players had to compete by borrowing them from fellow competitors. The ability to bring together even countries having bitter relations onto the same platform was praiseworthy, but the failure to have them participate in all the games, especially major ones like football and cricket, was a major weakness.
The recent awards and cash incentives declared by the prime minister to the medal-winners in the SAG are really an encouraging and welcome step, but this alone will not develop sports in the long run. There must be a concrete vision, policies, enough budget and an effective implementation plan to assure the coveted progress in sports. The government should take steps to build stadiums and other sports facilities in each of the seven states.

280,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-saving-daughters/,"Karnali Province deserves praise for initiating the bold step to save daughters, an idea never thought out by the Centre
Just like what the government of Province-2 did last year to protect daughters through “Save Daughters, Educate Daughters” campaign, the government of Karnali Province has also taken a bold step to protect daughters through the “Bank Account for Daughters, Lifelong Security Programme,” which came into force from Tuesday. Karnali Province is the most backward mountainous region, where life expectancy is far below the national average of around 69 years, and the condition of women there is especially harsh. Karnali Province Chief Minister Mahendra Bahadur Shahi launched the programme by handing over cheques of Rs 1,000 each to four-month-old and two-month-old daughters born to two dalit women to open bank accounts in their names in Kalikot’s Khandachakra Municipality-1 and 2. Initiating the scheme, the chief minister said it was a ‘special one geared towards ensuring social justice for daughters’. Under the first tranche, the provincial government has handed over Rs 38.4 million to the local levels to open bank accounts in the names of newborn daughters. The social security programme was launched after completing the necessary procedures for opening the bank accounts for newborn daughters. It will be implemented in all the districts of the province.
According to the procedure, it will be applicable for baby girls born from the start of the current fiscal. Families wanting to join the scheme are required to apply to the concerned local levels by submitting necessary documents. It, however, will be applicable only for the first two daughters born to the same parents. In the case of girls without parents and raised by others, there is no limit about the number of girls entitled to the facility. Besides opening the bank accounts as an initial fund for newborn daughters, the provincial government will also contribute Rs 500 to their accounts every month. The local levels will release the fund into their accounts till they reach 20 years of age. The accumulated amount thus saved is expected to reach around Rs 200,000 in twenty years. The money provided by the government cannot be withdrawn until the girl attains 20 years of age.
However, there are some riders for withdrawing the money. The parents must provide up to secondary level education to their daughters, and they cannot marry till they cross 20 years of age to claim the fund. The main objectives behind launching this scheme are to bring an end to selective abortion, gender-based violence, child marriage and to encourage the parents to send their daughters to school. This will also help get rid of the old notion of the families that daughters are a social and financial liability. This programme will also help the provincial government develop its own human capital, an indigenous idea never thought out by the federal government. The impact of the scheme will be visible in society within the next couple of years. It will certainly help bring an end to the prevailing chhuapdi pratha that has disparaged the lives of menstruating women in the province. A new generation of women will come forward to do away with the age-old practice as they will become financially strong and educationally conscious. Karnali Province deserves praise for taking the bold step.

Cold wave
A cold thick fog has enveloped the eight Tarai districts of Province 2, pushing the mercury down and throwing life out of gear for the residents across the state. Schools have closed, visibility is down, people can’t go to work, and there are few people in the market place. The cold wave is actually a blanket of thick fog and smoke, and it affects everyone, young and old, students and workers. But children and the elderly tend to suffer more as they cannot take proper care of themselves. The health of the residents is of particular concern, with a sudden increase in the cases of common cold, pneumonia, diarrhoea and asthma. The best safeguard against the biting cold is to stay warm by staying indoors, wearing warm clothes or sitting around a fire.
Although a cold wave is expected in the Tarai around the middle of December and lasts for a month, it is necessary to remind the people to take all the necessary precautions to lessen its impact on their lives. In the last three years, the cold wave has claimed the lives of 46 people, mostly in the Tarai districts. With good preparation, human casualties could be avoided this time.

Two media posts were emotionally disturbing for me today. One was on Facebook: A photo of a little baby-girl who missed her parents (rather the whole family) in a terrible bus accident that took place in Sindhupalchowk. The other one was from an online news portal: Deadly statistics regarding recurring road traffic accidents (RTA) in Nepal. For example: 230 people have died due to the RTAs in just 28 days. Just two weeks ago (November 28), a bus accident in Arghakhanchi killed 19 people. Five days later (December 3), 14 died in a Jeep accident in Baglung. During the four-week period, 1,426 people were injured.
In just five months (mid-August to mid-December) this year, there have been 7,505 road accidents, killing 1,030 people, around 100 of them children.  If we go through last year’s statistics, on average, seven deaths and 40 injuries are taking place every day due to RTA alone. With the loss of so many productive lives, many more disabilities and massive burden on the dependent family members, I consider these RTAs a form of a recurring massacre.
Recent WHO data (2017) reveal that 3 per cent of all deaths in Nepal are due to RTA. Nepal ranks 79th in the world for RTA-related deaths. Among the SAARC countries, Nepal lies towards the higher side of RTA-related deaths. As per the 2017 data, RTA is the 11th leading cause of death in Nepal, following serious diseases related to the heart and lungs, TB, diarrhea, diabetes, pneumonia and the like. Is this not tragic? In the Kathmandu Valley alone, more than 5,500 RTAs happen every year, with more than 3 per cent leading to deaths.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Why are these tragedies recurring in our country? RTAs are multi-factorial in origin. We can divide the possible causative factors as: a) rider or driver-related; b) vehicle-related; c) environment and road-related; d) other factors like weather and pedestrians. Over-speeding, negligence, lack of rest, lack of proper training, alcohol or drug abuse, disabilities and diseases, lacking education are some of the driver-related issues. Most motorbike accidents in Kathmandu are due to adolescent riders with high thrill-seeking and low harm-avoidance traits. Such personality traits lead to rule avoidance or defiant tendencies. Aggression, hostility, negative attitude towards the government and laws, inappropriate social needs and unhealthy lifestyles may be additional psychosocial factors requiring consideration. These are very important aspects as 70-80 per cent of accidents are said to be associated with human factors, which are usually avoidable.
Mechanical or technical failures or deficiencies, old and poorly-maintained buses and trucks, overloading are some of the vehicle-associated factors. Lack of proper servicing of engines contributes to brake-failure or vehicular collapse. As per 2016 data, 2.5 million vehicles are registered in Nepal and ply on 26,900 km of roads. Half of those vehicles operate in the Kathmandu Valley alone.
Nepali roads are considered to be the most dangerous. Chances of RTAs on these roads are found to be 100 times more than in Japan, and 10 times more than in India. Steep terrain in the hills, snowy mountains and slippery roads after the rains make them accident-prone, particularly in winter and the monsoon. Poor condition of the roads, even in the capital city, with open manholes and rain-damaged structures are an additional nuisance. Lack of traffic lights and poor visibility in the evenings due to absence of street-lights when vehicular speed is uncontrollable make RTAs common during weekends and festival seasons, as reported in a study from western Nepal. Weather conditions are beyond human control. Other factors like unthinking pedestrians and wandering cattle and dogs are also contributory factors to the recurring RTAs.
As the cause is multi-factorial, so is the prevention strategy. There should be a holistic approach. A mass media campaign to change the public attitude on road-safety is necessary. Driving institutes should have an elaborate curriculum regarding traffic rules and road-safety. These institutes should be ranked according to the performance of the drivers trained by them. Safe drivers should be provided suitable incentives. Tax-exemption may be considered for them. Similarly, unsafe/ drunken drivers need proper punishment. Psychological evaluation of drivers (particularly those involved in public transport or night buses) should be made mandatory before providing them the license. Thorough records of their age, marital status and family details should be maintained.
We have examples of the positive effects of the anti-drunk driving rule (so-called mapase) in our country. School curriculum should also incorporate road-safety measures and traffic-injury prevention strategies. Hospitals should enforce trauma-registries. The government should have efficient programmes and sufficient budget not only for developing road networks, but also for road-maintenance, ro-ad-safety and disaster prevention. Unless proper policies are imposed, RTAs will continue to grow and recur, leading to more casualties, loss of life and disabilities among the survivors. Mental health consequences like grief reactions, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, cannot be overlooked in this situation.

282,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/baby-shower-in-nepali-culture/,"To my knowledge, a baby shower is a ceremony in which an expectant mother is showered with gifts that will be useful for the baby. Different cultures have different ways of marking it. This ceremony is widely celebrated in the western world.
Go back to the Vedic Ages, a similar event, known as Seemantha, existed, during which the mother-to-be was showered with dry fruits and various sweets for the well-being of the baby’s physical and mental development. Baby showers may have been a western norm for centuries. However, Seemantha has existed in our culture since time immemorial, but we are ignorant about how it might have flourished all over the world and may seem to us this is not something we have been celebrating in our society.
Last month, we had thrown a baby shower for the mom-to-be. We had invited dozens of people, and it was indeed a great time for everyone at our house at Macleod, Australia. To me, having to celebrate the aforementioned event looked like being a cultural copycat of the West, if I may say so. Therefore, I was thinking whether it would be rational to celebrate the baby shower at my residence. Honestly speaking, I did not celebrate it to be happy with myself, but, more conscientiously, I did not want my baby to remain an exception to the tradition when she grows up. To me, throwing a baby shower makes you feel as if you are making headway to becoming a responsible parent, who is always living up to the family’s expectations and desires. It certainly paves the road to parenthood and brings you to its preliminary stage of how you will go about dealing with the moral challenges when it comes to facing the ground reality of being a father in the first place.
This is the moment of my life when I try to tackle the moral dilemmas and the mixed feelings that are rampantly rooted in my mind’s cells. Life has always been tumultuous and choppy in its own right. We are the ones who need to smoothly sail through this arduous journey with an immense level
of patience and perseverance so as to be able to manage
the family’s needs and expectations.
I am beginning to learn to trim my time on social media and perhaps on other futile activities. It is always great to give quality time to your family, especially when you are having kids. Finally, I am making headway toward becoming a responsible father in the days to come.

283,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-ensure-privacy-right/,"It would be in the interest of the government not to push the bill through the Parliament on the strength of its near two-thirds majority
Like some of the previous bills registered in the Parliament, a new bill is likely to stir up a hornet’s nest as it runs counter to the people’s right to privacy. The Bill to Amend and Integrate Laws related to the Constitution and Operation of Nepal Special Service provides sweeping powers to the National Investigation Department (NID) to monitor the communications of any person or organisation that the government suspects is spying against the state or working against public interest. The bill was tabled by the government at the Federal Parliament recently for discussion. The Right to Privacy Act was enacted last year, and it allows an investigating agency to collect private data on individuals only with the permission of a court. What the bill under discussion in the Parliament does is it overrides the provisions mentioned in the Act and gives NID direct authority to monitor and intercept digital exchange of information of individuals without a court’s approval. Article 28 of the Constitution has declared the right to privacy and protection of information as a fundamental right, and no state institution has the right to encroach on it.
The Nepali Congress has come down heavily on the Operation of Special Service bill while drawing flak from human rights lawyers and the civil society. This points to the fact that the bill has been tabled without holding greater consultation with the stakeholders – the opposition, civil society and human rights activists. The NC Parliamentary Office says the provisions in the bill are aimed at squeezing the people’s fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution as it allows the leakage of information related to citizens, violating their privacy and freedom. Hence, it has demanded that the government immediately withdraw the bill. The bill requires service providers to provide information to the NID should it demand details of the communications that took place between individuals or organisations over the telephone, mobile phone or computer.
It is not understandable why the government has tabled the new bill so soon after the Right to Privacy Act was enacted in September last year, fully knowing that this would raise an uproar as the two are not in harmony. True the government has every right to defend the sovereignty of the country and protect it from any attempt to raise arms against the state, incite communal hatred and acts of espionage, sabotage and subversion. But while doing so, the government must see to it that it does not infringe upon the human rights of its citizens. As some rights activists note, the bill, if passed into law, could be used by the government to increase surveillance against its opponents, rights activists and civil society members or collect information of individuals even on flimsy ground. Hence, it would be in the interest of the government not to push the bill through the Parliament on the strength of its near two-thirds majority. It will be good to hold wide consultations with the stakeholders and amend the bill accordingly so that the fundamental right to data protection is ensured, together with six other privacy rights guaranteed in the new privacy law.

Avoid heaters in rooms
With the chilly winter season in full swing, doctors have advised people not to use heaters, firewood and charcoal inside a closed room. People have died of suffocation, or asphyxia, when asleep due to lack of oxygen in the closed room. Fire absorbs oxygen from the surrounding in the process of burning and releases harmful carbon dioxide that can be fatal to those sleeping in a poorly-ventilated room.
Inhaling carbon dioxide kills the brain tissue, making people unconscious and unable to react promptly. This could eventually take the life of those unconscious people if they are not rescued on time. One must see to it that the electric heater, gas heater, burning firewood or charcoal have been taken care of before going to bed, and windows of the room must be kept open to allow fresh air into the room. In the case of new mothers, pregnant women, infants or ailing people, chances of death are higher as their resistance power is less than that of normal people. Police said most people living in  shanty areas use firewood to keep their room warm, and they are unaware of the harmful impact of carbon dioxide on their health. The best way to stay safe from such incidents is to keep the room well-ventilated and avoid using heaters.

284,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/solar-power-plants-give-them-a-place-in-the-sun/,"Many countries around the world prefer not to depend on a single source of energy. An energy mix is considered to avoid complete blackout in case of failure, or deficiency, of one source of energy
A solar-powered power plant is proving to be a vital source of energy for many countries. In Nepal, too, solar power projects are gaining momentum. After hydropower projects, the second highest number of survey licenses have been issued for solar power projects.
There are many reasons for promoting solar power plants in Nepal. One of the major factors could be the minimal civil structures involved in solar power plants as compared to hydropower plants, which possess higher risk of damage during an earthquake. So during natural disasters, such as an earthquake, flooding or landslide, solar power plants could be a lifesaving source of energy. Due to its minimal civil structures, it could be revamped within a few months. Another concern is the depletion of water in snow-fed rivers due to global warming, which affects the energy production of hydropower plants.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
In May 2018, the government released a white paper, with a target to produce 15,000 MW of electricity in 10 years. To achieve such an ambitious goal, large-scale solar power plants need to be developed as they can be commissioned in 2-3 years whereas a hydropower plant normally takes 7-8 years. Hence, the government should not underestimate the capacity of solar power plants. With increasing innovation, economy of scale and growing popularity, solar panels could see positive outcomes in terms of efficiency, capacity, characteristics and price.
For example, bifacial panels are gaining popularity, and recent research has shown that their efficiency could reach up to 30 per cent. One of the leading consulting firms, namely “Wood Mackenzie”, forecasts that spot prices for modules could fall from $0.30 per watt-DC in 2018 to $0.18 per watt-DC in the next five years, a 40 per cent drop.
Recently, a group of economists and mathematicians at Oxford University found convincing evidence of learning-curve effects across different products, including photovoltaic cells, whereas in the case of PV cells, it’s quite steep: for every doubling of output, cost falls by over 20 per cent. It is certain that the cost per MW of solar power plant will decrease rapidly.
Another reason to opt for solar energy is energy mix. Many countries around the world prefer not to depend on a single source of energy. An energy mix is considered to avoid complete blackout in case of failure, or deficiency, of one source of energy. For example, in the case of Germany, the share of energy sources in gross German power production in 2018 was: renewables (34.9%), lignite (22.5%), hard coal (12.9%), natural gas (12.9%) and nuclear (11.8%), which clearly shows the dependency of the nation on different sources of energy. Similarly, in India, coal, lignite, gas and diesel comprise 63.2 per cent, followed by renewables (including small hydro projects, biomass gasifiers, biomass power, urban and industrial waste power, solar and wind energy), which is 22.7 per cent, and 12.6 per cent for hydropower.
The above examples clearly depict that energy mix is practised in many countries around the world. The government in its white paper targeted a 5-10 per cent energy mix with alternative sources of energy other than hydro. Apparently, the second largest potential source of energy is solar, which is a relatively newcomer: only 1.68 MW of solar power is connected to the national grid. To close the gap between the massive need for solar energy and the current supply, many solar power plants should be constructed and connected to the national grid. Let’s say, 5 per cent of energy mix of the total targeted 15000 MW of electricity would be 750 MW and 10 per cent would be 1500 MW. So, within 10 years, Nepal needs some large solar farms on a MW scale, which will assist the government to reach its target.
Grid connected solar power projects with battery storage could act in a manner similar to that of peaking run-of-the river hydropower projects, specifically during the evening peak hours. This kind of system enhances the effectiveness of solar power plants especially during the dry season and peak hours. Currently, Nepal is importing electricity during the energy-deficient season. There is also an advantage to the developer as far as the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) rate is concerned as such battery storage solar power plant could claim a PPA similar to the peaking run-of-the river hydropower projects. Thus, developing solar farms will also be cost-effective.
Large-scale solar power plants would be more preferable to the traditional means of power generation, such as coal power plants, and considering wildlife and land use impacts. The impact is less compared to a storage type hydropower project, as there could be devastating impact in case of dam failure, either by a natural disaster or design failure.
The only issue is the massive use of land for large-scale solar power projects, which is only unjustifiable in case of land use in forested regions and agricultural land. It could be anticipated that solar panels have low reflectivity and convert a large fraction of insolation into heat, which could lead to concerns that they may affect the global or local climate. To sum up, solar farms should be given a serious consideration. The omnipresent bright sun would surely enlighten the path to a prosperous Nepal.

285,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/human-resource-and-employee-satisfaction/,"Human resource is used to describe both the people who work for an organisation and the department responsible for managing resources related to employees. Here, I shall focus on people who work for the organisation rather than the department as a whole. The earlier one is also termed as ‘human capital’.
In today’s world, it is easy for organisations to invest in different directions. But before doing so, it is important to question ourselves where the investment will be the wisest to stand ahead of the competitors. Should we expand our business by investing aggressively on marketing? Should we open a new branch? Should we acquire some other business? One of the most important investments overlooked and sometimes ignored by most of the organisations is investing in human capital – their people.
The statement that human capital is the most important capital of a company is not new. This statement has been used time and again by CEOs, consultants, human resource management advisers and other stakeholders in a company. However, when they are asked, why “human capital” is not a part of the company’s financial balance sheet as such, then the question is not understood, and they say that the cost of the staff is in the exploitation account of the company it belongs to.
This is a major bottleneck: Personnel are considered a cost item for the company. However, this is not the case as employee satisfaction leads to ultimate increase in profitability of an organisation. Working condition and resources, work relationships, compensation and benefits and employee recognition are the four key attributes of employee satisfaction.
Further, if an organisation takes these things into consideration positively, favouring investment in the employees rather than seeing them as a mere expense to the company, the outcome would be exciting. Employee satisfaction leads to employee commitment and engagement, thereby driving business results.
Lastly, my request is to focus on employee satisfaction in their organisation. In the short run, it would look like a mere expense to an organisation, but in the long run, it will give returns just as an investment. Employees will be advocates of your firm, increasing the client base and quality of work. Some of the best companies of the world take employee satisfaction as one of the major factors for what they are today.

286,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-tough-law-needed/,"Road accidents can be minimised to some extent provided the bus owners and drivers are held accountable for the passengers’ safety
Fifteen persons were killed and 18 others injured, most of them critically, when a reserved bus met with a road accident at Six Kilo in Sunkoshi Rural Municipality, Sindhupalchowk Sunday morning. The police said the accident occurred when the bus en route to Bhaktapur from Kalinchowk, Dolakha fell about 500 metres below the road along the Lamosanghu-Jiri road. Nine women, five men and one child lost their lives while 18 others injured in the fatal accident were rushed to various hospitals for treatment. Police said the condition of most of the injured was critical. Those who survived the accident said they had reserved the bus for a pilgrimage to Kalinchowk, and they had stayed overnight at Mude. They said the bus met with the accident after the driver lost control at a sharp bend. Around 35 people were travelling in the ill-fated bus. The bus driver fled the scene immediately after the accident, and the police have launched a manhunt to nab him. The way the bus met with the accident shows that the driver was not familiar with the condition of the serpentine hilly road, where accidents occur quite often. In the past several months, Araniko Highway has seen many fatal bus accidents due to drivers’ negligence and poor maintenance of the public buses.
Nationwide, as many as 230 people have lost their lives in the past 28 days, majority of them in fatal road accidents. Nineteen people were killed on November 28 when a bus fell from the road at Narapani, Arghakhanchi, and 14 people were killed in a jeep accident in Baglung’s Badigad Rural Municipality on December 3. According to the Traffic Police, as many as 1,426 people were injured in road accidents within one month, while as many as 1,030 people have lost their lives in 7,505 road accidents in the last five months. A total of 7,961 persons were injured in road accidents during this fiscal. The figures for the road accidents reveal the utter negligence on the part of the concerned bodies, particularly the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, Department of Transport Management (DoTM) and Traffic Police, who are mostly concentrated in the cities.
The saddest part is that the government has not formed a probe panel even after 1,030 people were killed in the road accidents in the last five months. Nor have the ministry, DoTM and Traffic Police discussed ways to minimise road accidents. The government has also not initiated discussion on a draft bill on transport to hold the bus owner and driver accountable for passengers’ safety. Road accidents in Nepal are the highest in South Asia. On an average, seven people are killed in road accidents every day. Bus drivers are issued driving license without proper training. States in neighbouring India sharing similar topography see minimum road accidents because of the tough licensing system. Ten years of driving experience is required to drive a vehicle in the mountains in some of these states. This approach could be highly useful in Nepal’s hilly terrain, too. Besides the poor condition of the roads and carelessness of the drivers, bad maintenance of a vehicle and overloading are also contributing to tragic road accidents. Road accidents can be minimised if these problems are duly addressed by the concerned authorities.

Congested jails
With crime growing in the country by leaps and bounds, it is putting undue pressure on the limited capacity of jails across Nepal. The 74 jails spread across 72 of the country’s 77 districts have a capacity for just 15,466 prisoners, but there are 23,775 jailbirds in them. Some of the prisons are bursting at their seams, and this has had telling effect on the health of the prisoners, space to sleep, overall sanitation and food quality. The jails have not only Nepali prisoners, but also foreigners, who are there for overstaying their visa, drug smuggling, cyber crime and pedophilia, among others. They must find the conditions in Nepal’s prisons really appalling.
It is good to learn that space for as many as 4,166 prisoners was added during the past one year. And quite a few jails are under construction, including Nepal’s biggest – meant for 7,000 inmates – at Nuwakot, to the west of Kathmandu. Hopefully, they will not only ease the congestion seen in Nepal’s jails at present but also provide better living conditions, such as more space, recreation facilities and a library and educational opportunities, to the prisoners. Prisons should be more of a correction centre than a place for punishing inmates.

287,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/teachers-and-learner-autonomy-possibilities-and-challenges/,"A learner autonomous pedagogy has such attributes as resource centres in the classroom or even outside the classroom like a library and a computer lab, where students can have uninhibited access to what they need or want to learn
Anyone with a non-rebellious inclination and schooled predominantly under a teacher-centred system of education expects learning and knowledge to trickle down from the teachers.
This writer is amongst that anyone, and it probably wouldn’t have mattered much had he gone on to pursue any profession other than teaching.
The pedagogical spirit of today is clearly in favour of promoting learner autonomy as opposed to heteronomy, which, by numerous scholarly definitions of the word, he was surely subject to.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Staying with scholarly definitions, the term, learner autonomy, was first coined in 1981 by Henric Holec, who defined it as the “ability to take charge of one’s own learning”. This implies that learners take ownership and make decisions for their learning themselves.
Heteronomy, by contrast, is seen to be lying at the opposite end of this continuum, a top down pedagogy, and heavily teacher-centred.
All these exposures have had an unavoidable implication in his classroom, and he might well be a representative character here of teachers who oscillate between heteronomy and autonomy, but clearly favouring the latter nonetheless.
A combination of various approaches have been adopted in order to promote learner autonomy. Workshops and trainings, to the extent that this writer has attended and is familiar with, are geared towards the objective of making students lifelong learners and much less reliant on outside agency, or teachers. The newly formulated national educational framework enshrines this idea and urges the concerned stakeholders to strive for it.
If this were to be called a paradigm shift, it indeed may have happened in terms of policy documents and at the theoretical level, but the shift in practical terms may not be as swift. They take place piecemeal, with teachers indeed trying out new or the newly suggested ways while reverting time and again to the familiar and known practices.
As long as they have been trying – this teacher for one has consistently been trying – it could be taken as a sign of progress.
A major dilemma that a teacher faces though is the question of how much autonomy is good autonomy. And what is he/she to do of a scenario where what a learner needs to learn is already predetermined by the curriculum?
Promoting learner autonomy becomes even more challenging for teachers in the backdrop of time-bound examinations, which the students must compulsorily take.
Ergo, the torn teacher, who despite the knowledge of the known benefits of learner autonomy, cannot put it into practice all the time. In whatsoever proportion it does happen though, if the teachers are making it happen, they might have been doing a good job.
A learner autonomous pedagogy has such attributes as resource centres in the classroom or even outside the classroom like a library and a computer lab, where they can have uninhibited access to what they need or want to learn.
Encouraging portfolio-based learning, coupled with a lot of self-reflection and journals about one’s process of learning, is another approach towards that goal.
Any teacher who has upwards of 25 students and a 45-minute time slot per day, without a co-teacher, can well relate the amount of patience and flexibility required for such modes of learning.
In a recently held weekly speakers’ club of Kathmandu University, Prof. Zakia Sarwar, founding member and Hon. Executive Director of Society of Pakistan English Language Teachers (SPELT), observed that the teachers’ mindset is the biggest hurdle to learner autonomy.
It surely is, especially if still in this day and age, where a plethora of other means are at the disposal of the students to learn, teachers hold fast to ‘I teach, you learn’ position.
However, even the ones with an open mindset face a different kind of challenge – the challenge resulting much less from their own conviction of the expected fruits of learner-centredness than from the constraints posed by the system under which both the teachers and learners must operate.
Reading of the available literature on learner autonomy makes this writer feel, in his capacity as a teacher, that perhaps it is too idealistic to implement and expect learner autonomy in its entirety.
That actually may be too high and an unrealistic goal to set in the first place. Besides the various institutional constraints, there is also skepticism that arises in the teachers out of the contradictions between the real classroom learning outcomes and various such theoretical claims.
The best that this writer has been able to do as a teacher is make efforts towards promoting learner autonomy whenever possible and feasible.
Students collaborate, make use of learning centres, work on self-chosen projects – all of which fits the bill of learner autonomy. On other days, it is not uncommon to find their teachers holding forth, explaining if not lecturing and demanding certain answers to be written in a certain way while still trying to keep their minds open. It might still be possible to make the students independent and responsible towards the path of life-long learning amidst just the right bit of teacher intervention.

288,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/relevance-of-education/,"When I first embarked on my career, we had a co-worker, a rich man, a scion of industry. He had returned from Canada with an MBA degree. Those days an MBA degree was as valuable as a medical or engineering degree if not more. An MBA degree meant entry as a manager. I joined as a trainee and was still a couple of steps away from climbing to that post. The MBA chap made me feel lacking even though I was already holding a weighty responsibility. I, too, harboured a dream to do my MBA after garnering a few years of work experience. As destiny will have it, the company ‘sacked’ the MBA chap before he could even complete his probation period. And this forced me to give up my MBA dream and instead focussed on working diligently to become a manager. I soon realised that one requires a lot more qualities and skills, not necessarily negative ones, other than an MBA degree to become successful in a country like Nepal. One did not even require a higher degree to be successful in business.
A banker and ‘industrialist’ often claims in the social media that although he studied up to 8 or 10 standards, he employs master degree and PhDs in his companies. I have an acquaintance who ran an airline even though he had not completed his school education. On the other hand, a PhD from JNU in Peace and Conflict Management is doing odd jobs to survive. While teaching part-time in a Plus Two factory, I asked a student who would come to class once in a blue moon not to bother coming to school. He could not even write his name in Nepali, let alone English. During my classes, I would urge the students to take up a part-time job or learn a manual skill. I would tell the students that the waiter’s job could teach many skills.
Unbeknownst to me, the delinquent student started working as a waiter. He then started coming to school once in a couple of months. A year or so after I quit teaching, the student greeted me in the street. At first, I did not recognise him. The lout had transformed into a smart man. He started working in a restaurant and had become a skilled bartender.
A few months later he sent a message on messenger saying he was working at the VIP lounge in Doha Airport. Some of his bright classmates are still looking for jobs in Kathmandu. Unless people go for technical education like medical, engineering or flying, formal education might not guarantee success in the job market.

289,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-bring-culprits-to-book/,"It is best the police stay away from situations they were not trained for and allow competent agencies to handle them
Three persons, including a police inspector, were killed in a bomb explosion in Chhireswornath Municipality in Dhanusha district Friday night, an incident that could have been largely avoided if only common sense had prevailed. According to reports, the police inspector, Amir Dahal, had set off the pressure cooker bomb planted at the gate of the house belonging to a local, Rajesh Sah, with a stick instead of waiting for a bomb disposal unit of the Nepal Army to arrive on the scene. There are speculations that the inspector might have thought the bomb hanging from the door handle was a hoax, but his foolhardiness not only took the lives of the house owner and his son but also injured three other members of Sah’s family and a policeman. The father and son duo had died on the spot while the inspector died on the way to hospital. What is particularly sad is that the very person who had called the police to report about the bomb should die in the explosion. There is little doubt that carelessness on the part of Inspector Dahal led to the tragic accident.
As per reports, an unidentified person had informed Rajesh about the IED (improvised explosive device) by telephone, but it is not known who could possibly have planted it in his house. But the police have made some arrests on suspicion that the IED might have been planted by cadres of the outlawed Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), led by Netra Bikram Chand. The party’s cadres have been involved in such nefarious activities in the past – setting off bombs in communication giant Ncell’s offices and towers and in extorting money from teachers and civil servants in the countryside – but the CPN has not owned up to the incident. The deceased, Rajesh, owned a pharmacy and is said to have been lending money to locals at exorbitant interest rates, of upto 36 per cent. Could this have been a reason for targeting Rajesh? Whatever the reason, planting a bomb in someone’s house with the intention of destroying life and property, if need be, is a condemnable act.
The Dhanusha incident should be an eye opener to the police force about how not to deal with sensitive safety matters. Many a times, police folly or highhandedness has only aggravated a situation, as was the case last week in Kohalpur in mid-west Nepal, after a truck hit an 11-year-old girl about to enter school, crushing both her legs. The police need better training to enhance their skills in dealing with different circumstances. It is best they stay away from situations they were not trained for – in this case disposal of bombs – and allow competent agencies to handle them. Minister for Home Affairs Ram Bahadur Thapa has vowed to act tough and bring the culprits involved in planting the bomb to book. The people will be watching how soon he does this. Although there has been an improvement in the law and order situation over the years with the writing of the new constitution in 2015, there are some political groups that have refused to join mainstream politics, instead resorting to intimidating tactics to push their agenda through. It is time the Home Ministry acted tough against them so that people feel safe and secure in the society.

Bicycle lanes
Cycling is a good exercise. An hour of cycling a day keeps a person physically fit and healthy. However, the Kathmandu Valley does not have dedicated lanes for cyclists along the major thoroughfares. During the local level elections, all the political parties had promised to make all the municipalities of the Valley bicycle-friendly. However, they have failed to keep their promises. Some sections of the city areas have seen declared bicycle-friendly, but they are unsafe for the bicycle users.
Marking the 25th anniversary of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) on Saturday, the city mayor, Bidhya Sundar Shakya, vowed to introduce cycle lanes in major parts of the city in the near future.
In 2014, the government had declared both sides of the Maitighar-Tinkune road segment as dedicated cycle lanes. But they are now used as footpaths. The KMC must coordinate with the Department of Roads (DoR) if it wants to develop cycle lanes in the city areas as DoR is the sole agency to take care of them. Once some sections of the roads are dedicated to cycle lanes, none else should be allowed to use them. The traffic police must make sure that the cycle lanes are used only by the cyclists, not by motorcyclists and others.

290,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/women-deliver-let-them-handle-gender-based-violence/,"Although the mere presence of women in political positions does not guarantee any particular policy outcome, their greater representation in the legislature is linked to increased legislative focus on health and other social services
The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (GBV), an annual international campaign, came to an end on December 10. Amid the campaign, the world has witnessed many cases of GBV. Priyanka Reddy, a 26-year-old veterinary doctor in Hyderabad, India was gang raped and murdered, which sparked outrage across India and even the world. Similarly in Nepal, Parwati Budha Rawat was found dead while staying in a “menstruation hut” in Achham district, Sudurpaschim Province. Likewise, a few months ago, Aarti Chaudhary, had filed a complaint at the District Police Office in Dhanusha after her husband, Indrajit, and in-laws physically abused her for failing to bring enough dowry.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
One question regarding this issue is, why did the girl’s side not file a complaint against Indrajit when dowry was demanded in the initial phase? When someone files a case against demand for ‘enough dowry’, does it not indicate that dowry is legal? Dowry is related to the mindset of the people and is an anti-social practice.
The above incidents of GBV are only representative cases. However, violence against women is being endured even in the 21st century. Despite the feminist movement, GBV exists in Nepal and throughout the globe. In Nepal, in particular, such a scenario is related to the level of women’s empowerment and their level of domination in leadership positions. Since women’s presence in the state apparatuses is very low, GBV cases are not being handled aggressively.
There had been a political deadlock in Nepal for decades. After completion of three elections and the constitutional obligation in the aftermath in favour of gender and social inclusion, the political impasse has ended. Full participation of women in political life is not only a guarantee of their human rights, but also an essential requirement in building peaceful societies. The veteran human rights activist, Michelle Bachelet, once said, “When one woman is a leader, it changes her. When more women are leaders, it changes politics and policies.”
Regarding the status of Nepali women’s representation, there is a need to shed some light on it. Nepali women’s representation in the legislative body was dramatically increased to 32.8 per cent through the Constituent Assembly (CA) election held in 2008. In the election, 191 women leaders (33.2 per cent) were elected out of 575 seats, and the Cabinet nominated six women out of 26 seats, resulting in 197 women members (32.8 per cent) in the legislative parliament. As a result, Nepal stands 14th globally in sending women leaders to the legislature parliament. The reason behind the dramatic change in women’s representation is the reservation of seats provided through the Interim Constitution of Nepal, 2007. This gradual constitutional obligation also gave the first woman president in Nepal.
With the first woman president, there is some hope that people will see positive change in terms of empowering women through education and developing their leadership capacity. Beyond its intrinsic value, greater gender equality in politics and public life will bring distinct orientations and behaviours to office. Indeed, among citizens and legislators, women and men often have different political interests and priorities, issue positions, party preferences and legislative behaviours. Although the mere presence of women in political positions does not guarantee any particular policy outcome, their greater representation in the legislature has been linked to increased legislative focus on health and family policy, more spending on social services and less on defense.
Currently the Federal Parliament has 32.7 per cent women. But very few women are seen vocal in raising concerns on national issues with rationality. So they need to be provided leadership training to sharpen their capacity. If we look at the political parties, constitutionally, all four parties—the Nepal Communist Party, Nepali Congress, Samajwadi Party Nepal and Rastriya Janta Party Nepal—are illegitimate in that they have failed to ensure the constitutionally-mandated minimum 33 per cent of women in the party structures. The status of women in the Nepali bureaucracy is just as pathetic.
In Nepal, due to the constitutional obligations, women have been able to hold political positions as mere representatives. But there is a vast difference between representation and leadership. The time has come to think why the representatives cannot be ‘leaders’. The feminist critique of patriarchy is founded on the arguments that all social structures and systems, and all political systems, are patriarchal. According to feminist arguments, the division of power between men and women that has persisted throughout human history systematically oppresses and disadvantages women. It operates throughout society, in politics, work, the family, legal and judicial systems.
Last but not the least, women should be posted at law enforcing positions. There is a need to eliminate the patriarchal mindset from society, only after which a level of change will be seen in the society. The anti dowry and chhaupadi law must be implemented brutally to discourage such anti-social practices.

291,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/the-under-utilised-resource/,"Many agencies, conventions and organisations are working to make gender an issue of priority. But is that enough? What about the patriarchal mindset of the people? Of course, more and more women are gradually participating in decision-making in society. Still women are an under-utilised resource.
I was privileged to attend school and pursue higher studies without having to fight for the minimum right to education. Still, there are a great number of women whose contribution to the different sectors is hardly recognised.
There are many women in Nepal who possess impressive qualifications. Parents these days invest in their daughter’s education unlike in the past when money was saved for her marriage. It is good to see women intellects with creative ideas and potential. But after marriage, they fail to add value to that qualification, as women are often asked not to work outside and remain within the private domain. The daughter-in-law has no role in decision-making even if it is about her career and her independence. Because of this, Nepal is losing out on potential thinkers, producers and innovators. Additionally, it also leads to diminishing self-respect and dignity of a woman.
The aspiration to work or accomplish one’s goals makes women self-confident, independent and secure. Anyone would be content and proud if the skills and potential are recognised and utilised. Unfortunately, there still exists the notion that an ideal daughter-in-law is supposed to be a home-maker while it is the husband’s responsibility to earn the living for his family and to maintain the family dignity.
Every human being evolves according to society, and yes, when you are part of it you have to be responsible. But does that mean compromising on one’s self-respect and dignity? There is always criticism and rigidity when you first try to step up against the conservative patriarchal traditions. Without change there is no scope for development. With time, society, traditions and culture change gradually, which leads to evolution and development. A change in perspective requires a radical shift in the core beliefs, but it is very difficult to change these core beliefs. Hence, women themselves must transform their mindset in the first place so as to start looking at the problem differently.
As a quote goes, “If you don’t like being a doormat then get off the floor.”

292,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-online-lottery-scam/,"People should stay away from online lottery schemes, while banks must overhaul their software system as per the NRB directives
With the advancement in information technology and easy access to the Internet, smart mobile phones and social networking sites, transnational rackets are misusing them to dupe unsuspecting Nepalis in the guise of online lottery. This is a recent phenomenon, making it difficult for the law enforcement agency to deal with such a racket. No sooner had an international racket stolen millions of rupees from the Lahan-based branch of Nepal Agriculture Development Bank by feeding malware into its computer system and Panos Remit in the capital a few months ago than another racket, in connivance with Nepali accomplices, has duped 34 people of Rs 146.7 million through banking channels. Police have arrested three Nepali members of an organised international racket for duping people of millions of rupees through an online lottery scam and hacking the banking system to remit money abroad. According to the Metropolitan Police Crime Division (MPCD), Nigerian, British and Indian nationals were operating their racket using their Nepali agents from outside the country to swindle gullible users of such a huge amount of money through online lottery and on the pretext of sending valuable parcels via social media. It has come to light that a Nigerian national and a Briton are the ringleaders.
The police have learnt about the existence of 14 bank accounts held by Nepali agents, who duped unwary people through the online lottery scam. Fifteen of those duped have already lodged complaints with the MPCD. They had deposited cash in the said bank accounts when asked to do so by the scammers. The racketeers allowed the Nepali agents to keep 15-20 per cent of the amount collected through the scams and hacking the banking system as commission for the work done. The agents would transfer the remaining amount to India via several channels, including hundi. Nepali agents were found to be operating more than six bank accounts each.
The way Nepal’s banking system has been hacked time and again over the last four years shows that something is wrong within it, which needs an overhaul to deal with the emerging threat. It would also be impossible to hack the banking system without some kind of hint or help from the employee(s) of the concerned banks. Nepal Rastra Bank had issued circulars to the banks to upgrade their software systems to make them foolproof. But they have failed to heed its directives. People will lose confidence in the banking system if such incidents continue unabated. Duping people of millions of rupees through online lottery scams is a serious case, which the law enforcement agency and the banks cannot take lightly. Most of those cheated by the international racketeers are from the rural areas, little educated, illiterate about information technology or unemployed, who want to earn easy money overnight. This could be the main reason why they fall prey to transnational rackets. One must be aware of the fact that nobody will offer cash or a lucrative prize to anyone for no reason. The only way to stay free from such scams is to avoid entertaining such messages and also to educate others about such acts.

New education policy
The government has introduced the National Education Policy-2019, which is structured in line with the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. While compulsory and free basic education is a salient feature of the new policy, it has given emphasis to science and technology in a bid to produce technical manpower at all levels.
Nepal’s education system was in need of a major overhaul, given the falling education standards at all levels, indiscipline and growing unemployment in the country. A good education policy if implemented well can help produce the necessary manpower in the country itself and save billions of rupees that go to train our human resource in foreign universities. At the heart of any education policy, however, lies the training of good teachers who can mould students into future nation builders. Unfortunately, Nepal’s education system has been marred by politics, both of the teachers and students. Unless the parties show the will to dismantle politics in education altogether, it is going to be an uphill task to realise the ideals of the new policy, namely that of producing educated, civilised, healthy and capable human resource and bringing prosperity to the nation.

293,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/on-bitcoin-seek-help-of-experts/,"The law made during the Nineties is the base of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, being illegal in Nepal. The government must be open to adapting new technology. Innovation needs to drive policies not the other way around
Soon after Tootle and Pathao took over the transportation market in Nepal, the Department of Transport Management shared a notice announcing ride-sharing as illegal. Similarly, the government attempted to charge a high licensing fee when Wifi became mainstream in 2006. The driving force behind cases like these is the lack of research and reluctance in proactive policy making, which in turn discourages innovation and new technology. The illegality of ride sharing applications can be compared to how Bitcoin is now being banned in Nepal. On August 13, 2017, Nepal Rastra Bank issued a notice banning Bitcoin. Two acts: Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 2019 BS and Nepal Rastra Bank Act 2058 BS have been given as the reasons behind this ban. However, what is more baffling is that the ban has not been followed up by research, nor was the ban based on research. In both scenarios, policymaking is reactive and fearful of new changes rather than adapting itself to them.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Ever since the emergence of Bitcoin in 2009, it has started a global debate on cryptocurrency. A key question on this ongoing debate is: “Does cryptocurrency fall under the definition of money?” In theory, cryptocurrency follows all the rules of money, such as it being a medium of exchange. However, practically, Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will not replace local currencies (at least for the next ten years) as every country needs to establish their own monetary policy to manage factors such as inflation. Cryptocurrencies are not stable enough to make price comparisons and transactions. For example, it doesn’t make sense to pay $3 one day and pay $57 on another day for the same cup of coffee. Globally, many countries have defined cryptocurrency as an asset and is taxed accordingly.
As the technological world is intrigued by Bitcoin, they are equally fascinated by the promises of blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin.
Blockchain Foundation Nepal in support of World Vision International and Paluwa Pleaders organised a Blockchain Symposium 2019 in November. Five research papers were presented including the legality of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in Nepal, how Sustainable Development Goals can be addressed through blockchain, a survey to understand the mentality of Nepali towards blockchain and agile project management in blockchain.
While presenting on the legality of cryptocurrency, Shishir Subedi, a director of Paluwa Pleaders, stated that advocates from the government side and judges do not even know the basic concept of Bitcoin in order to make rational decisions in court. He was specifically referring to the case of involving Bitsewa, which is still ongoing in Kathmandu District Court. This has been one of the biggest hurdles for the Nepali technological advancement scene, where the lawmakers and practitioners are reluctant to do research, bring relevant experts and act proactively.
As digital and physical realities are merging to form a single integrated form of modern living, the argument that policymakers should be reactive and let the previous laws define the current innovation is obsolete. Santosh Shrestha, the co-founder of Rumsan Tech, says, “New technologies and innovation cry for new regulations and laws. But while we wait for regulations to catch up with the speed of development of these new technologies, people who use these technologies usually will need to “break” the old law.”
While the Electronic Transaction Act 2063 BS (2008) has not even defined online payment system properly, it is ambitious to relate this to address blockchain and cryptocurrency. However, we can introduce the minimum regulations scheme, which allows the innovation to flourish without disrupting the current order massively. We can curb on the trading part whereas being lenient on the development aspect.
Saujanya Acharya, project lead of ‘Sikka’, a digital asset transfer network that transfers digital credits to beneficiaries especially used for aid distribution, expressed his frustration at the ambiguity of these laws as Sikka had to back out from using Ethereum (uses cryptocurrency) because of the law of Nepal. They later switched from Ethereum to Hyperledger because there’s no crypto involved in hyperledger. A comparable example would be if vending machines give out cocaine, the vending machine itself should not be made illegal. The ambiguous regulations should not slow down the innovation process. In the current scenario, where majority of the policymakers and law practitioners are not aware of blockchain technology, providing legality to cryptocurrency may not seem like a wise move at a glance. But this cries for the need of bringing in experts to adapt and understand the need of a newer technology rather than outrightly avoiding it. In order to comply with the foreign currency regulations, as well as continue to encourage innovative technology in Nepal, we should develop our own national cryptocurrency backed by the Nepali rupee.
The lawmakers need to focus on progressive and proactive policymaking. The government needs to be open to adapting new technology, and they need to bring in outside experts to help them create laws – there should be a wider public debate about Bitcoin and ride sharing apps and other similar controversies, unless Nepal wants to continue living in the 20th century.

294,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/its-all-in-the-gut/,"It’s all in the gut is a commonplace precept. It narrates the possibility construct within and outside of our intuitive compass. This isn’t gawking at our star-signs—in simple terms, our gut is the contextual junction between us and our world. To picture a case in point — the earthworm scuttles ever so unobtrusively through the soil, ingesting a tiny part — a fraction of which travels through its pint-sized body and transforms into a casting.
This is a remarkable natural enterprise. It extracts and adds rich value to the soil. You and I network in much the same way, the variance being of degree.
The food we all eat is integrated into our tissues— the surplus is ousted. You get the point— our digestive tract corresponds to a temporary transit point for building blocks of energy, which may be used or stored for use. It reflects our temperament, too — including our larger personality that represents us. It showcases our own fertile ‘soil’, a complex web of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Such microorganisms, like everything that happens in our world, fight for territorial rights — including individual hegemony. They allude to the famed Darwinian maxim — survival of the fittest.
Our life is a complete stage-show; it is complex and mutually dependent. You cannot, for instance, stub out a species to benefit the other. This holds good for our gut, too. If we promote just fungal forms in our gut, it hampers the presence of good bacteria at the cost of our well-being.
Do you know that bacteria — good and bad — are absolutely essential for the proper functioning of our gut? Just think of it — our digestive function could go erratic in the absence of such microbes. This, in turn, could affect normal assimilation of food and its nutrients.
There is yet another dimension to our gut — that it is all-embracing, also ahead, of our ‘gut feelings’. When we don’t take good care of our gut, no food can make us feel cheerful. Our palate leisurely goes into a state of bad taste.
This muddles our sense of what is right, or may not agree with our gut. We may gradually tend to forget what our gut, the seat of observation, knows best — more so, when it has moved into a state of confusion. Our ancients were wise. They not only espoused the harmonious foundation of eating right — or eating with meditative simplicity — but also amplified their wellness quotient and conscious awareness, while leading a gutsy life.

295,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-ending-inequalities/,"Most of the countries in South Asia are way ahead of Nepal, making it more and more difficult to catch up with them
Nepal has improved its standing in the Human Development Index (HDI) 2019 by two spots compared to last year, but it is of little solace when juxtaposed with the other countries of South Asia. Nepal is now ranked at 147 out of 189 countries in the HDI, according to a report published by the United Nations Development Programme Tuesday. Nepal has been placed in the medium human development category, having acquired a HDI rating of 0.579 in 2018. In the region, only Pakistan and war-torn Afghanistan fall behind in the HDI. The review shows that Nepal has made progress in terms of every indicator. But this has not translated into better ranking for Nepal because other countries have performed much better. In South Asia, India, Bhutan and Bangladesh are way ahead – at 129, 134 and 135, making it more and more difficult for Nepal to catch up with them. As for Sri Lanka (71) and the Maldives (104), they have always fared very well in the HDI rankings.
The HDI assesses long-term progress in three basic dimensions of human development—a long and healthy life, education and a decent standard of living. As per the report, between 1990 and 2018, Nepal’s HDI value increased from 0.380 to 0.579, an increase of 52.6 per cent. Although Nepal’s life expectancy and expected years of schooling are relatively higher than the average score for South Asia, the country tends to lag behind in the mean years of education among the adult population and per capita income. Nepal’s life expectancy at birth is 70.5 years (69.7 years for south Asia) while the mean years of schooling is 4.9 years against 6.5 years for South Asia. As for gross national income (GNI) per capita, as per purchasing power parity, it stands at $2,748, trailing far behind the South Asian average of $6,794.  In fact, in terms of per capita income, Nepal is just ahead of Afghanistan ($1,746). Nepal’s 2018 HDI value is below the average of 0.634 for countries grouped in the medium human
development category and also below the average of 0.642 for countries in South Asia. Nepal literally lies on the edge of the medium human development group, and a major natural disaster, like the big earthquake witnessed in 2015, could push Nepal’s ranking really down.
The 2019 HDI has also explored inequalities in human development, not limiting itself to disparities in income and wealth, but going beyond income, beyond averages and beyond today. If Nepal’s HDI value of 0.579 is discounted for inequality in the distribution of the HDI dimension indices, then the value would come down to 0.430, a loss of 25.8 per cent. What inequalities in human development do is they give rise to frustration in society, destroying social cohesion and people’s trust in the government.
As the UNDP report notes, they make it harder for political decisions to reflect the aspirations of
the whole society and to protect our planet. The HDI report should be an eye opener for the government to introduce policies that will end inequalities in human development in the country instead of shaping decisions that serve the interest of a few. There are plenty of lessons to learn from Nepal’s neighbours on this score.

Compensate fairly
The government has not been able to set a principle of compensation for the land to be acquired for development projects. This is the reason why the local people often resort to bandhs demanding fair compensation for their land. This problem has once again surfaced in the proposed 1,200-MW Budhigandaki Hydel Project, being built in Dhading and Gorkha districts, because of the government’s unscientific approach in dealing with the locals when it comes to providing compensation for the land the project needs.
As the earlier compensation plan worked out by the local administration did not work, the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation and the locals have now reached a four-point deal in which the government will review the earlier compensation arrangement and make a master plan to relocate the project-affected people to the nearest areas. A national pride project, which helps give a boost to the national economy, should not make the locals poorer than they were after their relocation. A development project rather should help uplift the people’s condition of living. It is meaningless to build a project that displaces a large number of people from their ancestral areas with an uncertain future.

296,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/fiscal-commission-issues-at-stake/,"It rests on the Fiscal Commission to ensure that the country’s fiscal governance is set on the right track to warrant that the multi-level federation, envisaged according to the new constitutional arrangement, delivers effectively
The arrangement related to distribution of fiscal resources is the mainstay of federal polity. In fact, no federal institution can function effectively unless adequate financial resources are provisioned. Principally, it is affirmed that economic stabilisation and income redistribution functions should be performed at the national level. But the functions related to provision of public goods and service delivery should be carried out at the sub-national level. According to Anwar Shah, renowned fiscal federalism expert, when governmental decisions are made closer to the citizenry rather than in the national capital, the public is likely to keep track of the decision about government services and taxes to finance them.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
In fact, the way taxes and spending decisions is made and inter-governmental transfers are structured determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal governance system. However, in many countries, assignment of tax and expenditure between the national government and sub-national levels is not equitably instituted and established. And sub-national governments have at their disposal diminished volume of resources that do not match their needs and requirements. In several cases, local governments are endowed with enlarged and broad-based set of unfunded functions. As a consequence, they cannot discharge their functions and responsibilities in an effective way.
Article 228 of the constitution mentions about the taxing authority of the local government. It provides that the local governments can generate their income through taxes and loans from fiscal institutions subject to the provision of the law. The provision further empowers the local government to levy tax on the subjects of competencies as prescribed without having an adverse effect on the national fiscal policy, free movement of goods and services, capital and labour market and fiscal policies of the neighbouring provinces.
Article 229 of the constitution provides for a consolidated fund in the Gaunpalika (village government) and Nagarpalika (municipal government). In the consolidated fund, all income receipts like grant transfers from the federal and provincial government, own source of revenue, loans and income from other sources should be deposited. The expenditures from the consolidated fund should be allocated according to the procedure prescribed by the local government law. There are three major sources of revenue of the local government, which are their own tax sources, shared taxes and revenues, and inter-governmental transfers.
A local government budget is a document that makes disclosures of the anticipated income for
the financial year from each income source, plan and non-plan expenditures, and actual income and expenditure for the financial year before the current budget year. Like all government budgets, local government budgets consist of two sides, namely an operating/recurring budget, which covers the running cost, and capital cost, which covers the cost for infrastructure development and purchasing new equipment. Local governments are not generally allowed to plan deficit financing unless they have a definite source of income that compensates for the deficit and shortfalls.
Most importantly, the constitution provides for the creation of a National Fiscal and Natural Resource Commission to devise a methodology and mechanism for distribution of financial resources and natural resources among the three levels of the government. The commission determines the system and structure of intergovernmental fiscal relations.
Article 251 of the constitution enumerates a list of roles and functions of the commission. The major functions, as stipulated in the constitution and the act, include review of the finances of the government in accordance with the functional responsibilities; prepare an elaborate basis and design for sharing the revenue of the divisible pool in the federal consolidated fund; recommend a formula and process for sharing and distribution of equalisation grants to the provinces and local government; create the basis for sharing the tied and conditional grants among the provinces and local governments though proper evaluation on the basis of national policies and programmes.
The commission is also mandated to analyse the overall economic indicators to recommend the upper limit on internal borrowing for the federal, provincial and local government and review the basis of revenue sharing and suggest measures for improvement. The commission works out the modality for the distribution of natural resources and suggests ways and means to resolve disputes arising out of natural resources benefit sharing and distribution between the federal and provinces, among the provinces, provinces and local governments, and among the local governments.
The commission has thus extensive roles and responsibilities. However, the commission is yet to be fully constituted and made competent enough to function effectively. The chief of the commission has been appointed, but other members are yet to be filled in. It rests on the commission to ensure that the country’s fiscal governance is set on the right track to warrant that the multi-level federation, envisaged according to the new constitutional arrangement, delivers effectively.

297,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/beauty-hurts/,"When I was a child, I was given children’s books, especially Barbie storybooks. Some of them were colouring books where I could colour the dresses of the princess and prince as I fancied while others were mostly storybooks, which showed how the prince and the princess met and eventually got married happily ever after.
Nepali children books were similar in nature, especially the ones that had stories of a prince and princess. My parents used to buy me Barbie dolls as I was obsessed with them. I would look at them and wonder when I would ever be like them – flawless and beautiful.
As I grew up, my teachers, friends and people around me became the role model regarding beauty. I was in grade seven, and one of the teachers used to wear pretty sandals, and when she walked they made a noise. I began walking heavily too so that my shoes or sandals would make a noise. I saw that she used to match her nail polish with the colour of her clothes, and so I decided to match the colour of my earrings and hairband with that of my clothes.
When I entered adolescence, I was obsessed with the idea of looking pretty. Now my role models were actresses. I used to look at them and just be in awe. After high school, I got my first phone, and I remember taking hundreds of selfies. Soon beauty cameras came into vogue, even cameras where there were makeup filters.
So even if you didn’t wear any makeup, the app would put makeup on you. I would look at my flawless pictures and feel happy that I looked pretty. Not only that, the idea of being slim and having a zero figure became popular. I used to see actresses with hourglass figures and would exercise day and night to look like them.
All this time, I never took a moment to think why I was doing what I was doing. Why did looking beautiful become so important to me? Why was I wasting my time trying to be someone I was not? Due to heavy exercise, I began getting stretch marks on my body. I wanted my skin to look flawless and hence avoided oily foods and spices and would even cut down on my rice portions. I pushed myself to the limit, and my body started becoming weak.
I then saw one of my favourite makeup artists without any makeup on social media. I was shocked by the freckles she had. I then began thinking how delusive this world is. I began thinking how becoming beautiful hurts, not only to me but to thousands of girls out there.

298,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-sag-and-beyond/,"Nepal must use the SAG as a starting point to show better performance in the Asian Games and Olympics by keeping politics at bay
The 13th South Asian Games (SAG) concluded on Tuesday, with Nepal ranking second in the medal tally, riding on its best performance in all the games held to date. Pakistan will now host the 14th SAG. Nepal won a record number of medals – 51 golds, 60 silvers and 95 bronzes – in the SAG, including a gold in men’s football, a big achievement in itself. Nepal began on a winning streak with a haul of 15 golds on a single day, 14 of them in martial arts. What followed proved that Nepal’s forte lay in individual events, athletics and swimming included. Seventeen-year-old Gaurika Singh was the darling of the swimming events, bagging four gold medals, two silvers and three bronzes in different categories, equaling the overall record of Deepak Bista who had bagged four golds in taekwondo from as many SAG games. Gaurika is now eyeing the Olympics, which will be held in nine months. There were more favourable outcomes to make Nepal proud. Kiran Singh Bogati won the marathon gold held on Saturday while Santoshi Shrestha won the women’s 10,000m race, becoming the first Nepali woman athlete to win a gold medal. Gopi Chandra Parki bagged the men’s 5,000m gold. Baikuntha Manandhar is the first Nepali athlete to have performed a hat-trick in marathon in three consecutive editions of the SAG. Minu Gurung also became the first Nepali female boxer to win a gold in the 54kg category.
For the Nepali sports fraternity, the 13th edition of SAG will be something to remember for ages to come, thanks to the excellent performance, especially in individual events. A record number of medals were won by women while new records were also set in some events. One of the features of the game was that it was also held in the Lake City of Pokhara and the religious city of Janakpur to show that a regional level sports event could also be organised outside the capital. The National Sports Council (NSC) left no stone unturned to make it a grand success with people from all walks of life cooperating with great fervour, even though the necessary infrastructure was undergoing renovation till the last minute.
The SAG has concluded successfully, but the NSC cannot afford to rest on its laurels. This is a regional sporting event, which must be capitalised as a launching pad to now win medals in the Asian Games and the Olympics. The concerned ministry, in tandem with other sporting agencies, must rigorously train our sportspersons and start hunting for budding talents in areas where Nepal can perform fairly well in international events. While making adequate investment in sports, we must keep politics away from it, as the tendency has been to use the different sports bodies to serve the interests of the parties in power. Unlike other regions of the world, sports is not a priority of governments in South Asia, in general, and Nepal, in particular. This edition has, however, shown that Nepal holds huge potential, especially in individual sports. Despite the many hiccups, including delay in rebuilding the Dasharath Stadium and failure to provide the needed sports gear and equipment, Nepal has once again proved its ability to host the regional extravaganza within a limited time. All deserve praise for making it a grand success.
Children’s safety
Police have arrested an American citizen on the charge of sexually abusing minors in Kathmandu. Jason Lloyd Moody, 40, of Illinois, was arrested Monday from a hotel near the airport for sexually abusing three girls below 11 and also on the charge of abusing four underage boys. This, however, is not the first time a foreigner has been arrested for sexually abusing minors. The frequency with which reports about paedophiles are appearing in the media means that it could be a matter of serious concern, demanding immediate attention of the government, parents and the society at large.
Poverty makes it easy for paedophiles to prey on children, as was the case in the above incident, where all three girls came from squatter settlements. Entering Nepal is easy with visas readily available on arrival for anyone. As Nepal embarks on a mission to bring in two million tourists during the Visit Nepal Year 2020, one must see to it that such unwanted elements are rounded up before they do any harm. Hotels must be made to report on any suspicious presence of minors there. The authorities and the society must also keep close watch of shelter homes and such places where children are likely to be abused.

About nine centuries ago, a monk meditating at the base of Zeborong Mountain—in Bhijer, current day upper Dolpa—found himself on foot, retracing snow leopard pugmarks. He had lost his mandala and assumed that the animal’s signs would lead him to his valuable. He ended up in Jumla, ruled by a distraught king, whose queen had been suffering from a seemingly incurable illness. The monk was not a medical practitioner, but upon the king’s insistence, he prayed for three days, and the queen was saved. As a reward, Nasar Gumba was established in Bhijer, as the local belief goes. Even at the dawn of the 21st century, snow leopards continue to be protected by their cultural entrenchments in our country. But in today’s anthropocentric society, snow leopards face many threats that demand urgent attention. With population estimates at 4,000-6,000, distributed across just 12 countries in the world, the future of this species hangs on a precarious balance. Efforts to save the species continue globally, and Nepal is a frontrunner.

This urgency brought us to Shey-Phoksundo National Park (SPNP) last month on the government’s mission to collar two snow leopards with satellite telemetry devices. Our research mission, led by the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC), involved a team of around 20-25 individuals – local citizen scientists, SPNP staff, members of National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC) as well as WWF researchers.
Our selection of Samling Gumba—an 834-year-old monastery, located towards the south of Bhijer—as our expedition base camp was a product of periodical automated camera trap surveys. In May 2018, camera traps placed over 300 sq. km around Bhijer village had confirmed the presence of at least 14 individual snow leopards, indicating this region as a hotspot. Camera trapping was also conducted in September 2019 to identify current movement patterns of snow leopards before the team set out in mid-October. Given the pre-assumed density of the species in the area, we were enthused by the prospect of fulfilling our mission but dreaded disappointment—given the elusive nature of the species.
We arrived in Samling Gumba with a mixed bag of emotions and equipment, following ten days of travel and preparation. Operations ensued following a prayer ceremony, led by the head monk. We then oriented citizen scientists and SPNP game scouts on the objectives and methodology. From them, we learned about the landscape and movement patterns of snow leopards. But we were faced with a ‘needle-in-a-haystack’ situation: we had a total of 24 traps (less than 2 sq. feet each) distributed across 50 sq. kilometres.
Nonetheless, we leveraged our strategic advantage – combining existing knowledge on snow leopard ecology and movement with information from camera traps, we planned and placed the traps. Each of these traps was remotely monitored using radio transmitters at hourly-intervals.
The trap monitoring team mostly reported ‘all normal’, relaying that none of the traps had been activated. Occasionally, they reported changes in transmitter signals, triggering excited frenzies at our base camp, as a team prepared for visual verification of the activated trap site only to be greeted by disappointment. Most activations were caused by the abundant livestock that form a major livelihood source for the community or from non-subject wildlife. This cycle of wait, monitor, hope, false triggers and trap resetting persisted for about 15 days. Then, on the 16th morning, the farthest trap from our base was activated. A team sent for visual confirmation reported in loud whispers from the trap site, “A snow leopard has been captured, come quickly,” evoking a camp-wide cheer.
Everything moved really fast then. The entire team left from the camp, and trekked towards Bhijer village, descending further into and walking up the river valley, reaching the capture site. The animal was sedated, freed from the trap, examined for necessary data collection, collared, and released back into the wild. Before the release, our citizen scientist named the animal Zeborong, after the local Snow Leopard Conservation Committee in the region. The second animal, Samling Gumba, was trapped just two nights later.
Over the coming months, we will be monitoring the two animals and building an invaluable database on their home range, movement patterns, among other critical information that will aid in species conservation planning. Such research, although resource-intensive, is an important element in conservation. Similar research in Kanchenjunga Conservation Area and other parts of Nepal had earlier provided critical inputs to the country’s Snow Leopard Conservation Action Plan and the world’s first climate-smart Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Management Plan – Eastern Himalayan Landscape.
The traditions of various mountain communities continue to help snow leopards thrive in Nepal. With advanced science, increased understanding and concern of local communities towards the environment and informed leadership of the government, Nepal promises to be a global stronghold for the survival of snow leopards, in perpetuity.

300,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/a-girl-in-the-wild/,"Very few girls in our country get to work “in the wild”, but I did get an opportunity to involve in a Snow Leopard monitoring project in Shey-Phoksundo National Park, Dolpa. It was organised by the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund, and I have learnt so much from this journey.
Many people think that this kind of work is too challenging for a woman. And challenging it is! But I believe it is as hard for a man as it is for a woman. But in spite of the hardships, there are some invaluable things “in the wild”. The environment is so overwhelming: the air is fresh, the sky is clean, and the peacefulness of the surroundings brings you inner peace of mind, to the point where the negativity doesn’t affect you.
One of the thrilling experiences was walking not only off road but along steep cliffs and ridgelines. At first I felt very dizzy looking down and had to slow down my pace. But after a while, I lost that fear completely and even started to enjoy walking on the ridgelines.
I am convinced that a major source of motivation to stand strong in moments like these was what I learnt at the Vipassana Meditation Centre – Anichhya, or the lesson of impermanence. Though we are going through pleasant or unpleasant moments, we should keep in mind that everything is Anichiyaa. So our mind should always remain equanimous.
This lesson really helped me when I was walking uphill, or when we had to walk 12 hours a day for a few days in a row. I would tell myself: “If I keep walking, even very small steps, I will not remain in the same place.” I found this thought very practical. Whenever I saw a steep hill or mountain, I would think: “Okay! It needs to be crossed, so start walking and keep going.”
Another source of motivation during this expedition was my supportive colleagues, especially the men. When I was in the field with my fellow citizen scientists, I found them to be very attentive and supportive towards me and other colleagues.
From this, I understood that to support and respect women, no deep knowledge of gender equity and social inclusion (GESI) is required. Ultimately, it’s about humanity, humility and kindness. From this journey, one thing I can state with confidence is that instead of underestimating us, women, give us the opportunities, be supportive, and we will pay you back with success.

301,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-chapter-of-accidents/,"Heavy penalties are a must to strictly enforce the traffic rules for the safety of both passengers and pedestrians
Vehicular accidents are routine in Nepal, almost an everyday incident, and they fail to raise much concern except when a mishap involves many deaths or when the locals’ reaction to it spirals out of control, as in the case of Kohalpur on Sunday. Locals resorted to vandalism after a truck knocked down a girl while trying to cross the road to enter her school. The girl, a seventh grader, had to be flown in to Kathmandu after both her legs suffered severe injury and could not be treated in nearby Nepalgunj. After the demonstrations took a nasty turn, police forces had to be trucked in to quell the agitation and bring the situation under control. An indefinite prohibitory order has been put in place after irate students and locals set the truck involved in the accident on fire and vandalised hundreds of other vehicles on the Kohalpur-Nepalgunj road. At least 24 persons, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police and eight cops, were injured in clashes, three of them critically.
There are many reasons why accidents take place in Nepal. It’s all too easy to blame the mountain roads that are usually in tatters. Not only highways, even the streets of the capital are in need of major repairs. Even by the government’s account, it needs about Rs 88 billion to repair the country’s roads annually. But it has earmarked only one-tenth that amount for this fiscal. Add to the bad condition of the roads the poorly-maintained vehicles, overloading and drivers with poor driving skills, and you have a perfect recipe for a disaster. With vehicular accidents said to kill about 2,000 people annually in the country, the government must have a plan of action to rein in on the growing number of accidents in the country. With the increase in the number of vehicles year after year, the number of accidents as well as that of deaths and injuries will only increase if the concerned authorities do not act now.
Can something be done? The government could begin by making license issuance stricter. It is common knowledge that licenses can be bought in Nepal. Only recently, senior officials of the licensing department and traffic police officers were arrested by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority for having distributed 1200 licenses to those who had failed the trial or had not even appeared for it within a period of three months in 2012. Imagine the number of people who are driving vehicles in Nepal without deserving a license. The number of accidents would come down drastically if only everyone – both drivers and pedestrians – were to follow the traffic rules earnestly. Everyone is witness to public buses and micro-vans cramming as many passengers as possible to make some extra money for the driver and the helper. And one can see them speeding in the cities or on the highways to be the first to collect passengers. This greed to make a fast buck at the expense of the commuters is making travel unsafe for everyone.  The one thing drivers fear is heavy penalties. This will have to be strictly enforced to implement the traffic rules for the safety of both passengers and pedestrians.

Act prudently
Nepal’s constitution, which paved the way for the transition from a unitary to the federal system of government, has clearly laid out the framework for fiscal federalism. This framework allows provincial and local governments to prepare annual income and expenditure plans, providing sub-national governments the mandate to pursue development works. But local governments have lately been misusing their authority by getting involved in irregularities, according to a report prepared by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). The corruption watchdog’s report said local governments released payments to contractors prior to completion of the work and prepared project completion reports before completing the projects. The local governments also colluded with consumer committee members to haphazardly award contracts. These practices must stop.
Local governments are nascent. But that does not give them the leeway to engage in corruption. The CIAA has already asked them to refer to the Public Procurement Act before awarding contracts and releasing payments. It has also directed them to immediately terminate the contracts that were illegally awarded and start a fresh bidding process. Local governments should heed these calls, act prudently from now onwards and follow good governance practices.

The country’s oldest educational institution, Tri-Chandra Campus (TC), recently witnessed a strange event. Students physically assaulted the campus chief, Professor Pradeep Neupane. The incident happened when a mob, led by the ANNSFU (All Nepal National Free Students’ Union) that was protesting against the 100% fee hike in the Science and Humanities faculties, got enraged. ANNSFU is the student wing of the ruling party.
According to eye-witnesses and staff of Tri-Chandra Campus, the mob pulled Prof Neupane out of the building and on to the street, assaulting him several times on the way. As seen on the CCTV footages, Prof Neupane was thrown on to the floor, kicked and also walked over. At present, Prof Neupane’s office is padlocked, he is in a hospital bed, and nobody knows what is upcoming.
The government, human rights activists and Tribhuvan University (TU), the parent institution of TC, all are silent, but why? Will Prof Neupane be able to safely return to his workplace? Furthermore, will the ruling party take responsibility for the incident? These questions remain unanswered.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
TC has been growing as a hub of some ill-minded people in the name of student politics since the past couple of years. Students indulging in narcotics and drunkenness can be seen on the shabby side of TC. This is a threat to the genuine students.
This college is the first choice of students representing all social classes because of its nominal tuition fees and prime location. Because students coming from a higher social status have made it a transit point for abroad studies, the drop-out rate at TC is quite alarming.
It is more than 60% between the first and fourth year at the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.).
Professor Neupane has initiated some improvements at TC. Laboratories have been renovated with funds received from the University Grants Commission. The college, even though the oldest centre for higher education in Nepal, has been profoundly lacking in scientific equipment, requiring instruments worth more than Rs 10 billion.
Sadly enough, the student leaders seldom speak about the condition of the college, and what they have ever said about the state of the college is nothing but porkies. Nevertheless, the main problem is student politics at Tri-Chandra.
Constituent campuses of TU have the right to set up their own tuition fees after taking approval from the university. Prithvi Narayan Campus, Pokhara has set the annual fees at Rs 11,000 for General B.Sc. and Rs 24, 000 for B.Sc in Microbiology, whereas for B.Sc in Geology, one has to pay about Rs 33,000.
Another constituent campus of TU, Birendra Multiple Campus, Chitwan charges Rs 24,000 for B.Sc in Microbiology and Rs 36,000 for B.Sc in Geology, or B.Sc. in Meteorology. Private and community colleges, on the other hand, charge annual tuition fees of more than Rs 50,000, even for regular B.Sc General Science.
At Tri-Chandra, for the bachelor’s programme in Science, students had been paying Rs 7,000.
However, the fee has been raised to Rs 14,000 with the 100% hike mentioned earlier. This increment in fees is well-founded as the operational costs of the science programmes are incomparable to other disciplines.
Besides, the increment in fees does not affect the current students; it is only applicable for the next batch of first years.
Currently, there are more than 14,000 students studying at Tri-Chandra Campus, making it the largest campus in terms of enrollment.
Last year, this campus suffered a deficit of Rs 17 million because fees had not been adjusted for a long time. Most of the fees collected are spent on the payment of contract-based as well as part-time teachers, who unlike permanent faculties, are paid by TC itself rather than by TU.
As noticed by everyone, part-time faculties are a severe burden on the college, as they number very high. In physics, there are 46 part-timers; in microbiology, 36 part-timers; and in chemistry, 60 part-timers. The condition is quite similar in other departments as well.
Tribhuvan University has set a quota of 2,500 students for the B.Sc. programme, but TC is incapable of hosting such a mass. The campus has launched 18 different science combination programmes at the undergraduate level, which is probably the highest in all of South Asia.
No one has paid attention to addressing the shortage of classrooms on the campus. According to the students, some teachers do not attend practical classes. The college library severely lacks books. Such issues are not correctly handled by the college administration due to political polarisation and other reasons.
Currently, 40 per cent of the students enrolled in the Science and Technology programmes under the banner of TU have taken admission in TC. TU has five constituent campuses in the Kathmandu Valley, but students prefer to join TC, but this is not to be understood that education in TC is good. In reality TC is not able to deliver quality education.
This year, 343 students have given entrance examinations to join Amrit Campus, 62 to join Padmakanya Campus, 36 to join Bhaktapur, 118 to join Patan and 2,704 to join TC.
Because of the overflow of students, about 200 students attend the basic science laboratories, such as physics and chemistry, but their capacity is less than 40. Tribhuvan University has neither diverted the students to another college, nor has it managed the problems of TC.

Love has many colours and contours. And once I was also enveloped with the amorous version of love for one of my classmates in the university. It was otherwise a usual insipid day in the class, although our erudite professor was in his intellectual trance and was raining on us his blitzkrieg of unheard English words. A gentle knock on the door instantly drew my intention as I was sitting on the first desk quite close to the door.
A maiden bestowed with divine beauty and peerless grace elegantly sought the permission of the professor to come in. It was her first day in the class as she told me after the professor stopped droning on. Nidhi was somewhat late in taking admission, and thus she sought my assistance in managing with her backlog.
Over the months, we both became the best of friends and while studying together we would grab all the fun by bunking classes and watching the recently released movies. Now a close friendship was on the brink of blossoming into love. When we both were exactly on the same mantle wave length, I rolled out my feelings to her. In no time my love was reciprocated.
Cupid had now blessed me with my Muse. Like most of the lovers we also began to meet furtively outside the university and thereon decided to get spliced with each other for the life time.
But the much needed consent of her family could only translate our amorous dream into reality.
One day my Muse mustered up her courage and introduced me to her parents. But our destinies had different designs for us.
Her parents sternly disapproved our would-be love marriage, and tied her nuptial knot with someone else against her wishes. I was back to my home town with the degree of MA but without my Muse.
Twenty years have rolled by since I saw my love for the last time. After parting with her, I could not gel with any other girl. Having no malice against his Muse, this 46-years-old confirmed bachelor has now a vast treasure of memories of that elevating love.

304,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-cut-smoke-and-dust/,"The introduction of new technologies in Nepal could save both the ecology and economy while reducing the health hazards
Runaway urbanisation in the Kathmandu Valley has fueled a demand for construction materials, and bricks are the primary building material in the capital as they are in other parts of the country. One has only to take a stroll on the outskirts of the city, and you see dozens of brick kilns belching out thick stacks of smoke into the atmosphere. The pollutants not only impact the air quality and visibility of the surroundings, but also adversely affect the health of the workers and the local population. Brick kiln workers, who are directly exposed to dust and smoke day in, day out, are particularly prone to a host of respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, pneumonia, chronic cough, bronchitis and wheezing. However, a recent research done on 20 brick kilns of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur shows that majority of the brick kiln workers are unaware about the impact of dust and smoke on their health. Resource Centre for Primary Health Care had conducted the study to learn about the health status of the brick kiln workers and also about the occupational safety at the work place. The serious health risks posed to the brick kiln workers should be of concern to the government as well as the owners, and efforts must be made to reduce their exposure to smoke and dust.
The government has tried to ban the Fixed Bull Trench Kiln that is in vogue as it uses old and inefficient technology, which requires large quantities of coal to fire the bricks. The method is inefficient and poses a big threat to health and the environment as it releases large amounts of particulate matter, black carbon, sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Asthma and bronchitis apart, long-term exposure to such particles and smoke makes brick kiln workers susceptible to hypertension, cardiac problems and cancer. The brick kiln workers make up mostly migrants, who come to work for just six months, from December to June. The industry is largely unregulated, with the workers having no links to the local government or community organisations. This perhaps explains why the plight of the workers has gone largely unnoticed, except for occasional studies on health and pollution carried out by non-governmental organisations.
The emission of particulate matters and smoke could be drastically cut down by the use of improved technology in brick making. New technologies such as the Vertical Shift Brick Kiln (VSBK), Tunnel Kiln and Hybrid Hoffman Kiln are substantially cleaner than the Fixed Bull Trench Kilns. The brick sector is one of the most energy-intensive industrial sectors in Nepal. In the Fixed Bull Trench Kilns, energy cost is almost 32 per cent of product value whereas in a Vertical Shift Brick Kiln, it is 14 per cent. The introduction of new technologies in Nepal could save both the ecology and economy while reducing the health hazards. In February last year, the Ministry of Population and Environment issued standards for brick kiln emission and chimney height in a bid to limit air pollutants emitted by the brick factories. It is the government’s duty to follow up on them and see to it that the brick kilns abide by the rules so that everyone can enjoy the right to a clean environment.

‘Occupy Tundikhel’
Occupy Tundikhel campaign has entered its fifth week. During the campaign, scores of social activists have been organising various programmes daily to exert pressure on the government to stop the illegal encroachment at Tundikhel. According to historians, before 1950, Tundikhel covered the area from the Dashrath Stadium to the south to Rani Pokhari to the north. At present, its area has shrunk to the Nepal Army’s Pavilion adjoining Khula Manch, which is not open for the public. More than two-thirds of the area is occupied by construction materials meant for different construction projects around the Tundikhel area. The remaining area is used as a bus park, leaving no space for the public.
Tundikhel holds cultural significance and is part of the identity of Kathmandu. Tundikhel is an important community space that needs to be protected. Elsewhere, uncontrolled and unguided urbanisation has taken a toll of fertile lands that are inappropriate for construction. Government and community land has also been encroached and sold. The various guthi ponds in the Valley have been destroyed by the construction of shopping malls. A systematic and strictly enforced land use planning is essential for Nepal.

The inflow of remittances is an old topic in the study of migration, but one that has stimulated renewed policy focus in recent years. As global remittances are taking an upward trend to a degree that is on par with global development assistance and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the developing world, it is not surprising that this subject is of interest to policymakers.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Many reasons have been cited as to why migrants send money home. These include explanations of remittance behavior, such as ‘altruism’, which indicates that remittances go up when the economic requirements of families back home rise; the notion of ‘exchange’ which suggests that migrants are effectively repaying family and relatives for investments in the education or travel of the migrant; and the notion of ‘co-insurance’ where both migrants and family provide monetary and in-kind transfers to safeguard the other against short-lived shocks. It is generally agreed that remittances are likely to be higher in conditions where the migrant leaves the country due to economic rather than social or political factors, where they have temporary rather than permanent resident status, and where they have a family left behind.
The 2019 United Nations Report on the world’s progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) divulges that personal inflows of remittances from migrant workers are the largest source of external financing for low and middle-income countries (LMICs). According to the World Bank’s latest Migration and Development Brief, remittance flows to LMICs grew by 9.6 per cent in 2018 (up from the 8.8 percent rise in 2017), to reach a record $529 billion. They represent more than three times the size of official development assistance. Moreover, as FDI has been taking a downward trend in recent years, remittances stood close to the level of FDI flows in 2018. Further, in 2018, remittances represented more than 30 per cent of GDP in countries such as Tonga (35.2 %), Kyrgyz Republic (33.6 %), Tajikistan (31.0 %), and Haiti (30.7 %).
Remittance flows have a direct impact on recipient households by lowering poverty and inequality and increasing consumption and social well-being. They also have a positive impact on financial sector developments, such as increasing the access and use of financial intermediaries. They support in improving credit ratings of countries and help raise external financing.
Although remittances have a host of advantages, the remittance market, to a large extent, has not been exploited for prospective financial services. Furthermore, remittances are often not directed into productive investments  due to a) dearth of investment knowledge of the remittance clients, b) inconsistency in remittance transactions, and c) inappropriate investment-friendly climate. Again, remittances can produce currency appreciation, causing export prices to surge and import prices to be cheaper. Thus, there is a drop in export levels, and rise in import levels, which can impact the production markets by reducing employment.
An important disadvantage is that it can also encourage more migration of labour as family members obtaining remittances realise that they would be better off moving to other destinations and earn more money rather than staying back in their home country. Another drawback is that the country’s dependence on remittances increases. And, this could be alarming as an abrupt stop in these financial inflows could lead to a financial debacle.
In Nepal’s case, migrant remittances from abroad are a crucial source of income for the economy. They represented 2 per cent of GDP in FY2000, 22 per cent in 2010 and 28 per cent in FY2018. Though remittances have been generally used to finance consumption in the country rather than being channeled to raise productive capacity, spending remittances on consumption has, to some degree, led to improved private and public welfare.
However, there are also detrimental outcomes of being over-dependent on remittances. Too much dependence opens up Nepal to exposure to external shocks linked to remittance-sending countries. Likewise, remittance inflows have had a knock-on effect on imports. With exports dwindling, trade deficit has expanded.
Still, the overall impact of remittances in comparison to other types of international financial transfers has been encouraging and should be fortified more with appropriate policies without creating a dependency syndrome.
Remittances to Nepal have been generally observed as an important tool to reduce poverty and inequality, to impart social benefits, to act as buffers against economic shocks, and to produce other positive impacts. Still, their full developmental potential has not been realised so far.
The successful mobilisation of remittances for productive purposes basically hinges on the capacity of the government to build a ‘development-centred’ macroeconomic environment along with supporting the establishment of a viable and inclusive financial sector. Likewise, joint and intensive efforts must be aimed at establishing and improving the mechanisms through which the principal actors, especially the individual remittance senders and recipients, can leverage these flows for developmental purposes.

PARIS: France’s competition authority fined Google 150 million euros ($167 million) for anti-competitive behaviour and for having unclear advertising on the Google Ads page.
The fine comes as France and other European countries maintain high levels of scrutiny on major US tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, which are often criticised for having relatively low tax payments.
In September, Google agreed to pay close to 1 billion euros to French authorities to settle a fiscal fraud probe that began four years ago.
Google, which is the world’s biggest internet search engine, has also faced growing regulatory scrutiny about the content it promotes in search results and ads.
Isabelle de Silva, head of the French competition authority, told news conference that Google’s dominance in the online advertising business was “extraordinary”, with the US company having a market share of around 90% in that field.
Google said it would appeal the fine.
In January, France’s data protection watchdog had fined Google 50 million euros for breaching European Union online privacy rules.
The French watchdog stated in that January ruling that Google lacked transparency and clarity in the way it informed users about its handling of personal data, and had failed to properly obtain their consent for personalised ads.

307,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/scientists-narrow-age-estimate-for-fossils-of-human-ancestor/,"NEW YORK: Scientists say they have finally calculated the age of the youngest known remains of Homo erectus, which is generally considered an ancestor of our species.
The fossilised skull fragments and other bones were uncovered on the Indonesian island of Java in the 1930s. Determining their age has been a scientific challenge, and a wide range has been proposed by numerous studies.


In a report released Wednesday by the journal Nature, scientists conclude the remains are between 108,000 and 117,000 years old. Researchers used five dating techniques on sediments and fossil animal bones from the area, combining 52 age estimates for the analysis. The project took 13 years to complete.
“I don’t see any way to date this site more thoroughly,” said paleoanthropologist Russell Ciochon of the University of Iowa, an author of the study.
H. erectus arose in Africa about 2 million years ago and spread widely there and in Asia, and possibly into Europe. It reached Java more than 1.5 million years ago, and the new dates suggest it died out at least 35,000 years before the arrival there of our own species, Homo sapiens.
H. erectus may have been doomed on Java by climate change that turned its open woodland environment into rain forest, Ciochon said. Still, it evidently existed longer on Earth than any other species on our “Homo” branch of the evolutionary tree.
Susan Anton, a New York University anthropologist who did not participate in the work, called the dating effort “heroic.” But she said she considered the reported age range to be too narrow. She said she preferred a span of less than 550,000 years old to more than 100,000 years old.
That’s roughly what she and co-authors proposed in a paper published in 2011. The younger end of the range in that paper was as recent as 120,000 years, which she said is virtually the same as the new result.

Danish scientists have managed to extract a complete human DNA sample from a piece of birch pitch more than 5,000 years old, used as a kind of chewing gum, a study revealed yesterday.
The Stone-Age sample yielded enough information to determine the source’s sex, what she had last eaten and the germs in her mouth. It also told them she probably had dark hair, dark skin and blue eyes.

And genetically, she was more closely related to hunter-gatherers from the mainland Europe than to those living in central Scandinavia at the time, they concluded.
“It is the first time that an entire ancient human genome has been extracted from anything other than human bones,” Hannes Schroeder of the University of Copenhagen, told AFP.
Schroeder is co-author of the study, which was published in the review Nature Communications.
They found the sample during an archaeological dig at Syltholm, in southern Denmark, said Tehis Jensen, one of the other authors.
“Syltholm is completely unique,” he said.
“Almost everything is sealed in mud, which means that the preservation of organic remains is absolutely phenomenal.”
The researchers also recovered traces of plant and animal DNA — hazelnut and duck — confirming what archaeologists already know about the people who lived there at the time.
But they were not sure why their subject chose to chew the bark: whether to turn it into a kind of glue, to clean her teeth, to stave off hunger — or simply as chewing gum.

309,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/in-new-york-lab-centuries-old-corals-hold-clues-to-climate-shifts/,"PALISADES, NEW YORK: Some 20 miles north of New York City, a team of scientists is searching for clues about how the environment is changing by studying organisms not usually found in the woods around here: corals.

In the labs of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a research unit of Columbia University overlooking the Hudson River, the scientists led by Professor Braddock Linsley pore over feet-long coral cores they extracted from far-away reefs.
For Linsley and his colleagues, corals are a precious repository of clues about the past that may help predict future climate trends. They can also reveal how much and how fast environmental conditions have changed during a certain period of time.
Cores are the hard, stony part of a coral underneath the top of the colony – its skeleton. Much like trees, corals produce growth rings that record climatic conditions like seawater temperatures and rainfall as they grow.
In a lab room packed with boxes of coral samples, Linsley and a small team of colleagues cut the cores into slabs and then X-ray the slabs to reveal the annual growth bands.
Using dentist drills, they pulverize small pieces and run geochemical analyses of the coral dust to reconstruct changes in the temperature, salinity and acidity of the water around the coral on a monthly basis going back hundreds of years.
“It is years of lab work and a lot of frustration but once you get to that point, the final product is just so exciting because you’ve got this long dataset,” Linsley said.
Coral reefs develop over thousands of years and are vital to the survival and prosperity of countless marine species. They also curtail flood damage from storms and support human activities like fisheries.
As humans burn more fossil fuel – the biggest contributor to global warming – oceans absorb growing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2).
Some of Linsley’s recent research on corals from the South Pacific island of Tonga suggests that increased seawater acidification caused by excess CO2 could lead to a decline in coral growth rates, endangering the wellbeing of entire reefs.

LOVE AT FIRST CHANCE
Linsley, a tall and soft-spoken 60-year-old, grew up on the Connecticut coast, making dams in the sand and observing erosion on the beaches near the town of Guilford. He loved water and began his career studying ocean sediments and fossils.
His work on corals began after a chance encounter with a colleague who was visiting his girlfriend at the University of New Mexico – where Linsley was studying to get his PhD in the late 1980s – led to a collaboration.
“I was fascinated by the fact that the corals had these annual bands in them and you could potentially extract annual resolve records back several hundred years,” he said at his office in the leafy campus, papers and books scattered on his desk and photos of diving expeditions on the wall.
Corals also brought him closer to the water and he had to learn how to dive, a perk of the job for Linsley.
By studying the environmental records derived from corals, the scientist is hoping to be able to shine a light on issues like the rate of surface ocean warming, ocean acidification and the impact on coral reef ecosystems worldwide.
But one thing is already evident, he said. Environmental changes are happening much more rapidly than in the last several thousand years and they are “clearly linked” to human activity.
Linsley’s childhood home in Connecticut – which he said now regularly battles encroaching waters – stood as a stark reminder.
“My children are 11 and 13. I think about in 50 years from now when I’m not here, what’s it going to be like,” he said.

310,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/remote-island-off-east-timor-turns-sunlight-air-into-drinking-water/,"KUALA LUMPUR: Villagers on a tiny island off the coast of East Timor who have long struggled with water shortages have secured regular fresh supplies, using just air and the power of the sun.
The innovative scheme uses solar power to suck water out of the air and make it drinkable, with the aim of reducing plastic waste and providing the small community on the wildlife-rich island of Atauro with a renewable supply of drinking water.
“The people living on Atauro have not had the opportunity to drink clean water that is not packaged in plastic,” said Rob Bartrop, chief revenue officer at Zero Mass Water the US technology firm behind the scheme.
“For the first time … they have a renewable source of water they can rely on,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Population growth and climate change are putting increasingly intense pressure on the planet’s limited water supplies, with worsening shortages emerging from the Middle East to Asia and Latin America, researchers said last month.
Like many similar islands in the region, Atauro lacks water infrastructure, leaving its 10,000 inhabitants reliant on rainwater and bottled supplies shipped in to meet their needs.
The new project, run with the US non-profit Conservation International, began operating in June and uses a material to absorb or suck water out of the air which is then turned into clean water.
In addition to reducing Atauro’s plastic water bottle waste, the project produces 12,000 litres of drinking water per month.
Zero Mass Water’s technology is now being used in schools, homes and businesses more than 35 countries, but the Atauro project is one of the first to be designed to serve an entire community’s drinking needs.
“We hope that there is a lot of scope to replicate and expand in surrounding parts of the region,” said Bartrop.

311,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/holidays-bring-phishing-scam-surge-aimed-at-small-business/,"NEW YORK: The email looked legitimate, so Danielle Radin clicked on the link it contained, expecting to have her products included in a holiday gift guide.
“I instantly regretted it,” says Radin, owner of Mantra Magnets, a website that sells wellness products. “It took me to some random website that looked like those pop-ups telling you that you’ve won the lottery.”
Within days of that click three weeks ago, Radin began getting notifications that people in Ecuador, China and elsewhere were trying to access her email account. She wasn’t surprised; she knew her San Diego-based small business had been the target of a phishing scam.
While cybercriminals strike at any time of the year, they’re particularly active during the holiday and income tax filing seasons when computer users expect to see more emails — and scammers are increasingly targeting individual small businesses with phishing scams, sending messages that look legitimate but do harm instead. An unsuspecting owner or employee clicks on a link or attachment and like Radin finds that malicious software has invaded their PCs.
Cybersecurity experts find that criminals who used to blanket thousands of computer users in hopes of fooling a handful have refined their methods. Scammers find small businesses through websites, social media sites and by combing email address books. They also mine personal data from breaches at retailers and other large companies. Then, using a process called social engineering, they construct emails that increasingly look realistic, as if they truly come from a boss, colleague, friend, potential client or vendor, a bank and even the IRS.
“In the last year or two they’ve been running more professional campaigns,” says Perry Toone, owner of Thexyz, an email service provider based in Toronto. “It can take a couple of minutes for me to determine that they’re phishing scams. That tells me they’re doing a very good job.”
Radin believes the scammers found her through her website or a blog. Like many small businesses, she has an email address on her site, and the scammers figured out that she might be interested in selling via a holiday gift guide. But finding a target is one thing; the scam won’t work unless it tricks an email recipient into clicking. Even those who are tech savvy can sometimes let their guard down. Radin was duped even though she’s the author of “Everyone’s Been Hacked,” a book sold online.
Often a scam succeeds because there’s just a shred of doubt in a computer user — the email is realistic enough that an owner or employee feels they need to read it. Sometimes a staffer clicks out of fear or a sense of responsibility, says Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College.
“It might not sound very personal, but you have an idea that you should go ahead — you feel like the email is coming from the boss,” he says.
Computer users may not be looking as closely as they should at an email — there can be subtle signs that a message is trouble. Terry Cole, owner of Cole Informatics, a company whose work includes cybersecurity, recalls getting an email that truly seemed to be from a colleague. He was one of several people in the industry to receive it.
“It said that this colleague had sent me a secure private message that was ready for me to read and included a link to click. This was absolutely consistent with my normal experiences communicating with him,” says Cole, whose company is located in Parsons, Tennessee.
Cole didn’t do in that instance what he usually does and advises everyone to do: check the email address to be sure it’s completely correct. When he clicked on the link, it took him to a bogus website claiming to be connected with Microsoft and asking him for his ID and password. He went no further and suffered no damage to his PC.
The holidays provide scammers with extra opportunities: emailed greeting cards, package shipment notices, offers of discounts — all of them false. Cybercriminals also seek personal information from owners and employees under the guise of needing them to create a W-2 or 1099 tax form; at this time of year, business owners’ thoughts are turning to taxes.
“Something that claims to know you, your name, where you work and wants you to take some action is harder to spot,” says Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company based in Sunnyvale, California.
A common scam at holiday time is an email purportedly from the boss telling a staffer to go buy gift cards and email the numbers back, DeGrippo says.
“When it appears to come from a boss or CEO, I think there is that tendency among employees to follow those directions. They’re playing on their emotions,” she says.
Often, a scam succeeds in getting an employee to click on a personal email while on a company PC — many workers check their personal email while at work. Even though the email came through on a personal message, it’s the company’s machine that can be infected.
Companies can protect themselves in part by restricting employees’ access to personal email sites, Telang says. He also suggests seminars to help staffers understand the risks that even legitimate-looking emails can present.
Some of the scams aim at monitoring a user’s keystrokes. So anyone accessing a company or personal account of any sort can be giving a criminal access to their money or sensitive personal data. One tool to prevent a bank account from being emptied or a credit card maxed out is to have accounts with multifactor authentication; that requires a password and a separate code sent to a different device and that is different for each login.

312,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-co-founders-step-aside-as-pichai-takes-helm-of-parent-alphabet/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google co–founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping aside as leaders of the Internet behemoth they founded 21 years ago, ending an extraordinary run that saw them build one of the world’s most valuable and influential companies.
Trusted lieutenant Sundar Pichai, who has run the core Google search business since 2015, will immediately take the reins as CEO of parent Alphabet Inc.
“While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it’s time to assume the role of proud parents — offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!” Page and Brin wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.
Page, Brin and Pichai have shared an emphasis on developing artificial intelligence software to make web searching faster and more personalised, while expanding the range of information and services available from a simple text query.
But their vision faces unprecedented scrutiny, with governments on five continents demanding better safeguards, an end to what many view as anticompetitive conduct, and more taxes from the world’s largest online advertising company. Thousands of employees have protested, and some have even resigned, over ongoing concern that Google‘s famous “don’t be evil” mantra – once embraced by Page and Brin – may be cracking.
Streamlining Alphabet‘s unorthodox management structure could help the company better respond to the challenges and focus on growing profits, investors said.
“This signals a shift away from the more fringy efforts … and more towards a company focused on technology that makes money,” said Kim Caughey Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
Alphabet, which owns more than a dozen companies including self-driving car business Waymo and health care software company Verily, was created in 2015 as part of a restructuring. The Google unit retained control of major businesses including video giant YouTube, the Android smartphone software and hardware operations, and cloud computing.
Page had wanted to focus on developing the newer businesses, which collectively lose money. He left Google, by far the biggest and most profitable part of Alphabet, to Pichai, who in turn delegates a lot of authority to deputies who manage the various product lines. Brin had stayed on as Alphabet‘s president, spending time on robotics, health ventures and other research projects.
But Page and Brin, once regular sights at public events and at Google headquarters, had become much less visible in recent years. Page’s retreat into the background drew increasing criticism from employees and US lawmakers, who demanded answers from him rather than Pichai about controversial projects such as an experimental search app for Chinese users.
Page and Brin, both 46, remain directors of the parent company but will cede their respective CEO and president titles immediately, Alphabet said. The president role will not be filled, it said, describing the changes as long discussed.
Page’s voice has been impaired for years because of a chronic condition, but his health did not play a role in the decision to step aside, Alphabet said.
“With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it’s the natural time to simplify our management structure,” the co–founders said. “We are deeply committed to Google and Alphabet for the long term.”
The co–founders still control the company through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26.1% of Alphabet‘s total voting power, Brin 25.25% and Pichai less than 1%. Alphabet shares rose 0.56% following the after-hours announcement to $1,302.
‘MOONSHOTS’ AND REGULATORS
Page and Brin developed the core Google search technology while they were still graduate students at Stanford, and it quickly proved far superior to competing search engines of the early Internet era.
By the time it went public in 2004, Google dominated Web search and was on its way to becoming a household name and the most powerful force in the global advertising business. The young co–founders also nurtured a free-wheeling, engineering-driven culture that became a model in Silicon Valley, which is littered with startups launched by Google veterans.
Pichai, 47, who has spent 15 years at Google, rose to prominence while leading the development of Google‘s Chrome browser. He later led product development and engineering across all of Google‘s services for a year before gaining the CEO title.
Page and Brin are active in a range of non-Google ventures. Page funded a company attempting to develop flying cars, and Brin at a conference last year discussed a budding interest in cryptocurrency. The Alphabet structure was designed in part to let them pursue new “moonshot” projects.
Investors and regulators, however, were never completely sold.
Alphabet had used the separation between Page’s and Pichai‘s roles to defend its limited financial disclosures about YouTube and other large Google businesses when the practice was questioned by US securities regulators in 2017.
It contended that publicly reported financial results were in line with what Page reviewed as Alphabet CEO. Regulators did not take further action, but the company’s stance has frustrated investors trying to evaluate its performance.
Alphabet declined to comment on whether public financial reporting would change with Pichai assuming both CEO positions.

313,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/for-babies-born-with-hiv-start-treatment-right-away-study/,"WASHINGTON: When babies are born with HIV, starting treatment within hours to days is better than waiting even the few weeks to months that’s the norm in many countries, researchers reported Wednesday.
The findings, from a small but unique study in Botswana, could influence care in Africa and other regions hit hard by the virus. They also might offer a clue in scientists’ quest for a cure.
The Harvard-led team found super early treatment limits how HIV takes root in a newborn’s body, shrinking the “reservoir” of virus that hides out, ready to rebound if those youngsters ever stop their medications.
“We don’t think the current intervention is itself curative, but it sets the stage” for future attempts, said Dr Daniel Kuritzkes of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who co-authored the study.
Giving pregnant women a cocktail of anti-HIV drugs can prevent them from spreading the virus to their unborn children, a step that has dramatically reduced the number of babies born with the virus worldwide. Still, some 300 to 500 infants are estimated to be infected every day in sub-Saharan Africa.
Doctors have long known that treating babies in the first weeks to months of life is important, because their developing immune systems are especially vulnerable to HIV. But an infant dubbed the “Mississippi baby” raised a critical question: Should treatment start even earlier? The girl received a three-drug combination within 30 hours of her birth in July 2010, highly unusual for the time. Her family quit treatment when she was a toddler — yet her HIV remained in remission for a remarkable 27 months before she relapsed and restarted therapy.
The Botswana study was one of several funded by the US National Institutes of Health after doctors learned of the Mississippi baby, to further explore very early treatment.
The findings are encouraging, said Dr Deborah Persaud, a pediatric HIV specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the Botswana study but helped evaluate the Mississippi baby.
“The study showed what we hypothesized happened in the Mississippi baby, that very early treatment really prevents establishment of these long-lived reservoir cells that currently are the barrier to HIV eradication,” Persaud said.
She cautioned: “Very early treatment is important, but prevention should still be our top priority.”
In Botswana, researchers tested at-risk newborns, enrolling 40 born with HIV, treating them within hours to a few days, and tracking them for two years. On Wednesday, they reported results from the first 10 patients, comparing them with 10 infants getting regular care — treatment beginning when they were a few months old.
Medication brought HIV under control in both groups. But the children treated earliest had a much smaller reservoir of HIV in their blood, starting about six months into treatment, the researchers reported in Science Translational Medicine.
The earliest-treated children also got another benefit: more normal functioning of some key parts of the immune system.
One big question: Did the HIV reservoir shrink enough to make a long-term difference? To find out, next year the researchers will give these children experimental antibodies designed to help keep HIV in check, and test how they fare with a temporary stop to their anti-HIV drugs.
In the US, Europe and South Africa, it’s becoming common to test at-risk infants at birth. But in most lower-income countries, babies aren’t tested until they’re 4 to 6 weeks old, said study co-author Dr. Roger Shapiro, a Harvard infectious disease specialist.

314,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/web-inventor-has-an-ambitious-plan-to-take-back-the-net/,"World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee released an ambitious rule book for online governance — a bill of rights and obligations for the internet — designed to counteract the growing prevalence of such anti-democratic poisons as misinformation, mass surveillance and censorship.
The product of a year’s work by the World Wide Web Foundation where Berners-Lee is a founding director, the “ Contract for the Web ” seeks commitments from governments and industry to make and keep knowledge freely available — a digital policy agenda true to the design vision of the 30-year-old web.
The contract is non-binding, however. And funders and partners in the endeavour include Google and Facebook, whose data-collecting business models and sensation-rewarding algorithms have been blamed for exacerbating online toxicity.
“We haven’t had a fairly complex, fairly complete plan of action for the web going forward,” Berners-Lee said in an interview. “This is the first time we’ve had a rule book in which responsibility is being shared.”
For instance, the contract proposes a framework for protecting online privacy and personal data with clearly defined national laws that give individuals greater control over the data collected about them. Independent, well-resourced regulators would offer the public effective means for redress. Current laws and institutions don’t measure up to that standard.
Amnesty International just released a report charging that Google and Facebook’s business models are predicated on the abuse of human rights.
Berners-Lee nevertheless says that “having them in the room is really important.” He said both companies had approached the foundation seeking participation.
“We feel that companies and governments deserve equal seats at the table and understanding where they’re coming from is equally valuable,” he said. “To have this conversation around a table without the tech companies, it just wouldn’t have the clout and we wouldn’t have ended up with the insights.”
The nonprofit foundation’s top donors include the Swedish, Canadian and US governments and the Ford and Omidyar foundations.
One of its biggest challenges is the growing balkanization of the internet, with national governments led by China, Russia and Iran exerting increasing technical control over their domestic networks, tightening censorship and surveillance.
“The trend for balkanization is really worrying and it’s extreme at the moment in Iran,” said Berners-Lee. A strong government exhibits tolerance, the computer scientist added, for “other voices, opposition voices, foreign voices to be heard by its citizens.”
So how to prevent governments from restricting internet access at their borders?
One approach, said Berners-Lee, could be financial pressure. Multinational lenders could condition lower interest rates, for example, on a nation’s willingness to let information flow freely on its domestic network.

315,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-reins-in-political-advertising/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google is making it harder for political advertisers to target specific types of people.
The company said that as of January, advertisers will only be able to target US political ads based on broad categories such as gender, age and postal code. Currently, ads can be tailored for more specific groups — for instance, using information gleaned from public voter logs, such as political affiliation.
The change will take effect in the UK in the next week, before the general election, and in the European Union before the end of 2019. It will apply everywhere else in early January.
Google reiterated that ads making false claims are prohibited, adding that so-called deepfakes — realistic but false video clips — are not allowed. Neither are “demonstrably false” claims that could affect voter trust in an election.
But in a blog post announcing the news, Google Ads vice president Scott Spencer noted that political dialogue is important and “no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim and insinuation.”
“So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited — but we will continue to do so for clear violations,” he wrote.
Like all Google ads, political advertisers can also use the broader practice of “contextual targeting,” which involves placing ads about, say, climate change on articles about the environment.
The company is also requiring advertiser verification for a broader range of political messages. Previously, only ads mentioning candidates or officeholders for federal positions required verification. Now that will also include ads touching on state officials and candidates as well as ballot measures.
The move follows Twitter’s ban on political ads, which goes into effect on Friday.
Twitter also placed restrictions on ads related to social causes such as climate change or abortion.
In these instances, advertisers won’t be able to target those ads down to a user’s ZIP code or use political categories such as “conservative” or “liberal.” Rather, targeting must be kept broad, based on a user’s state or province, for instance.
Facebook has not made sweeping changes to any of its ads policies, but thrust the issue into public discussion this fall when it confirmed it would not remove false or misleading ads by politicians.
Critics have harshly condemned Facebook’s decision. Twitter also faced a backlash from those who found its ban too far-reaching.
Google has taken a more middling stance, but it’s unlikely to please everyone. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s campaign staff took issue with reports that Facebook might consider limiting its targeting practices.
“Facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020,” the campaign tweeted from its official account. “Tools that help us reach more great Americans & lift voices the media & big tech choose to ignore!”
Even Google’s limited targeting could receive backlash.
Critics and civil rights groups have said targeting specific zip codes or other small geographic zones can allow advertisers to discriminate or sway elections.
The expansion to Google’s verification process will take effect December 3.

316,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/amazon-says-its-considered-face-scanning-in-ring-doorbells/,"Amazon has considered adding facial recognition technology to its Ring doorbell cameras, according to a letter to a US senator defending its video-sharing partnerships with police.
The company told Senator Ed Markey that facial recognition is a “contemplated, but unreleased feature” of its home security cameras but that there are no plans to coordinate that feature with its law enforcement partnerships.
Markey wrote to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in September raising privacy and civil liberty concerns about Ring’s video-sharing agreements with police departments across the country. The company encourages police to tap into Ring’s Neighbors app, a forum for residents to share videos of suspicious activity captured by their home security cameras.
FILE – In this July 16, 2019, file photo, Ernie Field pushes the doorbell on his Ring doorbell camera at his home in Wolcott, Conn. Amazon says it has considered adding facial recognition technology to its Ring doorbell cameras. Photo: AP
The Massachusetts Democrat also expressed alarm that Ring may be pursuing face-scanning technology after a patent application showed the company is exploring a system that could flag certain people as suspicious and automatically alert police.
Markey released Amazon’s responses Tuesday.
Amazon’s initial response to Markey said Ring doesn’t currently offer facial recognition. Then Markey sent another letter to Bezos asking why it’s mentioned in Ring’s privacy policy. In a Nov. 1 follow-up, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, Brian Huseman, said that the company frequently innovates based on customer demand and that facial recognition is an increasingly common feature in cameras made by competitors such as Google’s Nest division.
“If our customers want these features in Ring security cameras, we will only release these features with thoughtful design including privacy, security, and user control,” Huseman wrote.
Markey’s questions about facial recognition were part of broader concerns that some lawmakers and civil liberties advocates have about Ring and its police partnerships. Amazon sought to address those concerns in its letters to Markey, emphasizing that camera owners have a choice about whether to share videos. The company noted that police aren’t allowed to seek recordings that are longer than 12 hours in duration or that cover a geographical area that is too specific or broad.
But Amazon also said it doesn’t require law enforcement to delete a user’s video footage after a certain period. Nor would it entertain Markey’s request that it commit to never selling users’ biometric information, saying only that it doesn’t do so now.
Markey said Tuesday that Amazon is not doing enough to ensure that its products don’t run afoul of civil liberties.
“Connected doorbells are well on their way to becoming a mainstay of American households, and the lack of privacy and civil rights protections for innocent residents is nothing short of chilling,” he said in a statement.
“If you’re an adult walking your dog or a child playing on the sidewalk, you shouldn’t have to worry that Ring’s products are amassing footage of you and that law enforcement may hold that footage indefinitely or share that footage with any third parties,” he added.
More than 600 police departments have signed up to Ring’s network since last year and many say it is becoming a useful crime-fighting tool. Among them is the police chief of Markey’s hometown of Malden, Massachusetts. Chief Kevin Molis said he is Markey’s neighbor and has known him since the 1970s but disagrees with him about Ring.
“We consider it a valuable tool for public safety,” Molis said in an interview. “Is it a bad thing that private citizens, in order to make their streets safer, are investing their own money in a product that’s allowing crimes to be solved and crimes to be prevented?”
But staff attorney Mohammad Tajsar of the ACLU of Southern California said Amazon’s responses to Markey raise grave privacy concerns. Amazon told Markey it has no way of knowing if its cameras are collecting personal data from children or positioned in such a way that they’re intruding on a neighbor’s privacy.
“Even if you don’t sell data, or provide data to law enforcement, you’re creating a mechanism whereby people can express latent biases and racism and classism in a portal that encourages it,” Tajsar said.

317,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/china-tests-mars-lander-in-international-cooperation-push/,"HUAILAI: China invited international observers to a Thursday test of its Mars lander as it pushes for inclusion in more global space projects.
The demonstration of hovering, obstacle avoidance and deceleration capabilities was conducted at a site outside Beijing simulating conditions on the Red Planet, where the pull of gravity is about one-third that of Earth.
China plans to launch a lander and rover to Mars next year to explore parts of the planet in detail.
China’s burgeoning space program achieved a lunar milestone earlier this year by landing a probe on the mysterious far side of the moon.

It has developed rapidly, especially since it conducted its first crewed mission in 2003 and has sought cooperation with space agencies from Europe and elsewhere.
The US, however, has banned most space cooperation with China out of national security concerns, keeping China from participating in the International Space Station.
Despite that, China’s ambitions continue to grow as it seeks to rival the US, Russia and Europe in space and cement its position as a regional and global power.
Guests at Thursday’s event came from 19 countries and included the ambassadors of Brazil, France and Italy.
“This event is the first public appearance of China’s Mars exploration mission, also an important measure for China to pragmatically carry out space international exchanges and cooperation,” the China National Space Administration said in a news release.

318,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/should-people-be-paid-for-sharing-their-personal-data-online/,"
LONDON: From tagging photos on Facebook to driving with Google Maps, people should join forces in “data unions” to demand payment for letting online tools collect their data, according to an economist advocating for radical reforms to improve society.
Glen Weyl, a principal researcher at the research arm of US tech giant Microsoft, said people have been “fooled” into handing over data that is then used in artificial intelligence (AI) to copy human behaviour and possibly eliminate some jobs.
“Humans are doing all this work and then we are being told that we are doing nothing, that we play no role, and that these systems are just going to automate us away. This is profoundly dishonest,” Weyl told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“We need to respect the fact that those data are actually being created by the very people who these companies are claiming are no longer relevant. And we need to acknowledge that by compensating them.”
While getting paid for tagging photos on Instagram or uploading to YouTube might sound way off, the idea has been gaining some traction in the United States as tech giants from Google, to Facebook and Twitter, face increased scrutiny over the way they handle personal information.
Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang has said people should receive a share of the economic value generated from their data, while the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, recently proposed companies should pay a “data dividend”.
Weyl said the amount people would get is a matter of debate but it would, in general, depend on the size of the economy that becomes automated, with people getting more money the more jobs are taken over by artificial intelligence thanks to their data.
Estimates vary from $500 a year in a present-day scenario, to $20,000 some 15 years down the line, when some projections say a third of all jobs will be done by computers, he said.
Yet, single users are unlikely to get a penny unless they organise in “data unions” similarly to what workers did during the industrial revolution, said Weyl, a speaker at the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s annual Trust Conference on Thursday.
“People get paid for completing surveys, or putting television boxes in their home that monitor how they watch television,” he said.
“The problem is that the ability of people to receive reasonable and fair compensation for what they do online is undermined by the fact that all these other people are consenting to do it for free.”
Unions could bring together users with specific sets of data, like on travel or shopping habits, and bargain a better price for it, said Weyl, who co-authored the 2018 book “Radical Markets” with legal scholar Eric Posner.
They could also help address privacy concerns by restricting what information is collected and how it is used, he added.
Some early versions of data unions already exist.
US start-up Datacoup offers users a platform to monetise their data, while Dutch group ‘Datavakbond’, or “data labour union”, was set up in 2018 with the aim of negotiating directly with Facebook and Google over data use.
But Weyl said more people needed to get involved or become vocal about the need for a more equitable system otherwise things could slide in the opposite direction, with a few powerful companies and central states controlling most data.
“We can build alternatives to the worst scenarios but those alternatives are not going to come unless we do it together,” he said.

That means “sky” in the language of the Native American Powhatan people, NASA said Tuesday.

NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew past the snowman-shaped Arrokoth on New Year’s Day, 3 ½ years after exploring Pluto. At the time, this small icy world 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometres) beyond Pluto was nicknamed Ultima Thule given its vast distance from us.
“The name ‘Arrokoth’ reflects the inspiration of looking to the skies,” lead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said in a statement, “and wondering about the stars and worlds beyond our own.”
The name was picked because of the Powhatan’s ties to the Chesapeake Bay region.
New Horizons is operated from Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland. The Hubble Space Telescope — which discovered Arrokoth in 2014 — has its science operations in Baltimore.
The New Horizons team got consent for the name from Powhatan Tribal elders and representatives, according to NASA. The International Astronomical Union and its Minor Planet Center approved the choice.
Arrokoth is among countless objects in the so-called Kuiper Belt, or vast Twilight Zone beyond the orbit of Neptune. New Horizons will observe some of these objects from afar as it makes it’s way deeper into space.

Stargazers used solar-filtered binoculars and telescopes to spot Mercury — a tiny black dot — as it passed directly between Earth and the sun on Monday.
The eastern US and Canada got the whole 5 ½-hour show, weather permitting, along with Central and South America. The rest of the world, except for Asia and Australia, got just a sampling.

Mercury is the solar system’s smallest, innermost planet. The next transit isn’t until 2032, and North America won’t get another shot until 2049.
In Maryland, clouds prevented NASA solar astrophysicist Alex Young from getting a clear peek. Live coverage was provided by observatories including NASA’s orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory.
“It’s a bummer, but the whole event was still great,” Young wrote in an email. “Both getting to see it from space and sharing it with people all over the country and world.”
At Cape Canaveral, space buffs got a two-for-one. As Mercury’s silhouette graced the morning sun, SpaceX launched 60 small satellites for global internet service, part of the company’s growing Starlink constellation in orbit.

322,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/one-big-step-google-buys-fitbit-for-2-1-billion/,"Google, the company that helped make it fun to just sit around surfing the web, is jumping into the fitness-tracker business with both feet, buying Fitbit for about $2.1 billion.
The deal could put Google in direct competition with Apple and Samsung in the highly competitive market for smartwatches and other wearable electronics. But it also raises questions about privacy and Google’s dominance in the tech industry.

The company’s announcement Friday came with a promise that it won’t sell ads using the intimate health data that Fitbit devices collect.
Fitbit is a pioneer in wearable fitness technology, making a range of devices that have become pop-culture accessories, from basic trackers that count how many steps you take each day to smartwatches that display messages and notifications from phones.
They can track activities such as running, cycling and swimming and record heart rates and sleep patterns. Fitbit typically asks for date of birth, gender, height and weight to help with such things as estimating calories burned. Some people use Fitbit’s app to record what they eat and how much water they drink. Women can track their periods.
Fitbit has 28 million active users worldwide and has sold more than 100 million devices.
Google, meanwhile, makes software for use in other manufacturers’ wearable devices, but those products haven’t gained much traction in the face of competition from Fitbit, Apple, Samsung and others. And Google doesn’t sell a device of its own.
The deal to buy Fitbit could give Google a needed boost.
“Google doesn’t want to be left out of the party,” said analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. “If you look at what Apple has done with wearables, it’s a missing piece of the puzzle for Google.”
Google’s pledge that it won’t sell ads using Fitbit health data is a continuation of promises previously made by Fitbit.
Privacy experts, though, were sceptical.
Consumer Reports health privacy expert Dena Mendelsohn said she is concerned that people enrolled in wellness programs through their employers that use Fitbit devices could lose control over their data.
“While a person may not have had concerns about Fitbit holding their data, they may have concerns over Google holding their data,” Mendelsohn said.
Google’s promise is also unlikely to stop it from gathering other information from Fitbit devices.
For example, Fitbit has GPS models that could track users’ locations. That could help Google know that a runner stopped at a coffee shop on the way home. Google could then display ads for rival coffee shops.
More important, having a Google device on the wrist could drive wearers to use Google services, even more, giving the company more ways to sell ads.
The deal is likely to face scrutiny from state and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust authorities, who are already investigating Google and other big tech companies over whether they have abused their market power.
“Why should Google be permitted to acquire even more companies while they’re under DOJ antitrust investigation?” Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, tweeted.
Still, analysts at equity research firm Cowen said they believe regulators are unlikely to block the deal because of Fitbit’s relatively small size and its focus on hardware.
While Fitbit all but created the field, it has been shredded by the competition. It was worth nearly $10 billion after it went public in 2015. But its value this week is well below $2 billion.
When rumours of a potential buyout by Google surfaced earlier this week, Fitbit stock soared almost 30%. It jumped nearly 16% more Friday.
Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet, will pay $7.35 per share. Alphabet stock gained about 1%.
“With Google’s resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone,” Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park said in a statement.
Fitbit has been expanding its partnerships with major health care companies such as Humana to encourage healthier living.
John Hancock announced incentives last year on its insurance policies for people willing to share data gathered by health-monitoring devices. It offers free Fitbits to participants.
Last year, Fitbit acquired a health coaching business that helps people manage conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.
Fitbit ranks fourth in global shipments of digital watches, fitness trackers and other wrist-worn devices, according to research firm IDC. Chinese companies Xiaomi and Huawei were No. 1 and No. 3, Apple was No. 2, and Samsung came in fifth.

323,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/dubai-displays-tech-reputation-with-global-robotics-contest/,"DUBAI: Seeking to bolster its image as a forward-looking metropolis, Dubai hosted the largest-ever international robotics contest this week, challenging young people from 190 countries to find solutions to global ocean pollution.

Event organisers say their selection of Dubai as host reflects a vote of confidence that this oil-rich Emirati sheikhdom can be a global hub for innovation. They also expressed hope that bringing together tomorrow’s scientists and engineers will help develop technologies to solve the world’s most pressing issues, particularly those related to the environment.
Dean Kamen, founder of first Global Challenge, said the Middle East represents a part of the world where “the adults have not learned how to play nice with each other” and it was up to young people to fix humanity’s self-inflicted wounds.
“We are in an accelerating race toward catastrophe, whether it’s global warning, melting of the (polar ice) caps, bird flu, terrorism — you name it, we’re worried about it. The solution to most of the world’s grand challenges depends on better technologies than we have today,” he said.
“This globe of ours is on life support, so the thought is we get every kid in every country to focus on learning how to use technology, but focus on using it as a tool and not a weapon,” he explained.
The unofficial “Robotics Olympics” seeks to encourage young people to pursue subjects known as STEM — science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Teams of four to five students, aged 14-18, each received a kit of rods, wheels, wires and other raw materials with which to assemble their roving robots. Their task: Collect orange balls of various sizes from a playing field, which represented human-created pollutants in the ocean. Some devised robots for scooping, while others snatched up and fired the balls through the air into the receptacles.
The teams then formed “alliances,” each with up of four nations, to battle their way to the final round. Overall, 1,500 students took part.
A team captained by Belarus, and including Syrian refugees, eventually won the gold medal, edging out a team captained by Israel in a dramatic final match. But organisers stressed a message of unity, not conflict.
“The kids get it. To them this isn’t a competition; this is a ‘coop-etition.’ This is a celebration of technology,” said Kamen.
Previous events tackled challenges related to clean water access and sustainable energy.
Robotics is a natural fit for Dubai, a city that’s already testing driverless cars and taxis. It’s become a magnet for international entrepreneurs, with an entire zone called “Internet City” that’s packed with high-tech startups. Next October, Dubai will host the Expo 2020, welcoming technological breakthroughs from around the world.
“If we are to become the city of the future, we need to have the right talent from around the world,” said Omar Al-Olama, the 29-year-old Emirati Minister of Artificial Intelligence, the world’s first such minister. “Artificial intelligence is based on data. Data is what drives all these new technologies. We have the holy grail of data. We have 200 nationalities represented in this country.”
FedEx recently announced Dubai would become the first city outside the US to test Roxo, an autonomous delivery device that can travel on sidewalks and even unpaved surfaces.
Roxo made its debut international appearance at this week’s robotics contest, drawing the interest of the tech-savvy teens hailing from places as diverse as Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. They mingled in Dubai’s Festival City, exchanging experiences and forming friendships while talking shop about their gadgets.
“We didn’t do so well in the matches because we had a lot of trouble with the control hub, but it doesn’t matter, we had a lot of fun,” said Stefan Sijbesma, 17, from the Netherlands. “For me, robotics is really important because it really helped me choose what I want to study and what I want to do with my life.”
The three-day tournament had a festival-like atmosphere to it, with announcers and commentators analysing the action in sports-broadcast style and fans waving flags and banners supporting their teams. The pavilion floor was filled with facts about the millions of tons of pollutants threatening the world’s oceans, and featured slogans such as “united by land, connected by oceans” and “together we turn the tide on pollution.”
As the nail-biting results were being announced, the Israelis huddled with their Ugandan teammates before embracing the winning team in a feel-good ending.
“I can’t believe it, it’s a miracle,” said Yamen Najjar, manager of Team Hope, which represents the Syrian refugees and was part of the winning alliance. “It was a very difficult competition for us, we faced a lot of problems, but we didn’t lose hope.”
Outgoing US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who’d made the original announcement that Dubai would host the event earlier this year in a surprise visit to the World Government Summit, was on hand. Perry said he’s followed the robotics tournaments since 2002 when, as governor of Texas, he attended one of the regional competitions in Houston and was “blown away” by the passions and abilities of the young contestants.
But he said he found their camaraderie even more impressive.
“It is stunning what these young people are doing,” Perry said. “Where the adults may have failed in the standpoint of international diplomacy, these young people may accomplish, and if that’s the case maybe that is the most important thing that comes out of this.”

The 25-year-old university dropout Boyan Slat founded The Ocean Cleanup to develop and deploy a system he invented when he was 18 that catches plastic waste floating in the ocean.
On Saturday he unveiled the next step in his fight: A floating solar-powered device that he calls the “Interceptor” that scoops plastic out of rivers as it drifts past.
“We need to close the tap, which means preventing more plastic from reaching the ocean in the first place,” he said, calling rivers “the arteries that carry the trash from land to sea.”
Slat’s organisation has in the past drawn criticism for focusing only on the plastic trash already floating in the world’s oceans. Experts say 9 million tons (8 million metric tons) of plastic waste, including plastic bottles, bags, toys and other items, flows annually into the ocean from beaches, rivers and creeks, endangering marine life in the oceans, including whales.
Three of the machines have already been deployed to Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam — and a fourth is heading to the Dominican Republic, he said.
Izham Hashim from the government of Selangor state in Malaysia was present at the launch and said he was happy with the machine.
“It has been used for 1 1/2 months in the river and it’s doing very well, collecting the plastic bottles and all the rubbish,” he said.
Slat said he believes 1,000 rivers are responsible for some 80% of plastic pouring into the world’s oceans and he wants to tackle them all in the next five years.
“This is not going to be easy, but imagine if we do get this done,” he told his audience of enthusiastic supporters, who whooped, clapped and cheered his announcements. “We could truly make our oceans clean again.”
Slat used his live-streamed unveiling to appeal for support from countries committing to clean up their rivers and businesses prepared to inject funding and help with the operation of the devices.
The vessel is designed to be moored in rivers and has a shaped nose to deflect away larger floating debris like tree trunks. The interceptors work by guiding plastic waste into an opening in its bow, a conveyor belt then carries the trash into the guts of the machine where it is dropped into dumpsters. The interceptor sends a text message to local operators that can come and empty it when it’s full.
Slat showed off how it worked by dumping hundreds of yellow rubber ducks into the water at the launch event in Rotterdam’s port. The interceptor caught nearly all of them.
The machines currently cost about 700,000 euros ($775,600), but Slat said the cost will likely drop as production increases.
Jan van Franeker of the Wageningen Marine Research Institute has been critical of The Ocean Cleanup in the past, but said the new device looks promising.
“I am really happy they finally moved toward the source of the litter,” he said in a telephone interview. “The design, from what I can see, looks pretty good.”
Slat argued that the economic impact of not picking plastic out of rivers is higher than the cost of buying and using the machines.
“Deploying interceptors is even cheaper than deploying nothing at all,” he said.

325,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-plans-to-send-water-hunting-robot-to-moon-surface-in-2022/,"WASHINGTON: NASA will send a golf cart-sized robot to the moon in 2022 to search for deposits of water below the surface, an effort to evaluate the vital resource ahead of a planned human return to the moon in 2024 to possibly use it for astronauts to drink and to make rocket fuel, the US space agency said on Friday.
The VIPER robot will drive for miles (km) on the dusty lunar surface to get a closer look at what NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine has touted for months: underground pockets of “hundreds of millions of tons of water ice” that could help turn the moon into a jumping-off point to Mars.
“VIPER is going to assess where the water ice is. We’re going to be able to characterize the water ice, and ultimately drill,” Bridenstine said on Friday at the International Astronautical Congress in Washington. “Why is this important? Because water ice represents something significant. Life support.”
VIPER stands for Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover.
The rover is expected to arrive on the moon‘s south polar region in December 2022, carrying four instruments to sample lunar soil for traces of hydrogen and oxygen – the basic components of water that can be separated and synthesized into fuel for a planned fleet of commercial lunar launch vehicles.
In development at NASA‘s Ames Research Center in California, the VIPER robot will log “about 100 days of data that will be used to inform the first global water resource maps of the moon,” NASA said in announcing the plans.
NASA is in the process of kickstarting its Artemis program, an accelerated mission to put people back on the moon for the first time since the 1970s to train and prove technologies that would later be sent on a Mars mission.
Scientists have eyed lunar water as a key resource for enabling long-duration astronaut missions on the moon, though its form and exact amount are unknown. VIPER will aim to find out.
NASA crashed a rocket onto the moon‘s south pole in 2009 to confirm traces of lunar water ice in the plume of dust kicked up upon impact.

326,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/facebook-launches-a-news-section/,"
Over the course of its 15 year history, Facebook has variously ignored news organisations while eating their advertising revenue, courted them for video projects it subsequently abandoned, and then largely cut their stories out of its newsfeeds.
Now it plans to pay them for news headlines — reportedly millions of dollars in some cases.
Enter the “News Tab,” a new section in the Facebook mobile app that will display headlines — and nothing else — from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, Business Insider, NBC, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times, among others. Local stories from several of the largest US cities will also make the grade; headlines from smaller towns are on their way, Facebook says.
Tapping on those headlines will take you directly to publisher websites or apps, if you have any installed. Which is more or less what publishers have been requesting from Facebook for years.
It’s potentially a big step for a platform that has long struggled with both stamping out misinformation and making nice with struggling purveyors of news. Though media watchers remain skeptical that Facebook is really committed to helping sustain the news industry.
Facebook declined to say who is getting paid and how much, saying only that it will be paying “a range of publishers for access to all of their content.” Just last year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wasn’t sure it “makes sense ” to pay news outlets for their material.
But now, as Zuckerberg told The Associated Press in an interview, “there’s an opportunity to set up new long term, stable financial relationships with publishers.”
News executives have long been unhappy about the extent to which digital giants like Facebook make use of their stories — mostly by displaying headlines and short summaries when users post news links. A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress this year would grant an antitrust exemption to news companies, letting them band together to negotiate payments from the big tech platforms.
“It’s a good direction that they’re willing for the first time to value and pay for news content,” said David Chavern, head of the News Media Alliance, a publisher trade group. “The trouble is that most publishers aren’t included.”
Zuckerberg said Facebook aims to set up partnerships with a “wide range” of publishers.
“We think that this is an opportunity to build something quite meaningful here,” he said. “We’re going to have journalists curating this, we are really focused on provenance and branding and where the stories come from.”
In a statement, the Los Angeles Times said it expects the Facebook effort will help expand its readership and digital subscribers.
Facebook killed its previous effort to curate news, the ill-fated Trending topics, in 2018. Conservatives complained about political bias, leading Facebook to fire its human editors and automate the section until it began recycling false stories, after which the social giant shut it down entirely.
But what happens when the sprawling social network plays news editor? An approach that sends people news based on what they’ve liked before could over time elevate stories with greater “emotional resonance” over news that “allows public discourse to take place,” said Edward Wasserman, dean of the graduate journalism program at the University of California-Berkeley.
“It deepens my concern that they’ll be applying Facebook logic to news judgment,” he added.
The social network has come under criticism for its news judgment recently. In September, it removed a fact-check from Science Feedback that called out an anti-abortion activist’s video for claiming that abortion is never medically necessary. Republican senators had complained about the fact check.
Facebook says a small team of “seasoned” journalists it employs will choose the headlines for the “Today’s Story” section of the tab, designed to “catch you up” on the day’s news. The rest of the news section will be populated with stories algorithmically based on users’ interests.
That sounds similar to the approach taken by Apple News , a free iPhone app. But Apple’s effort to contract with news organisations has been slow to take off. Apple News Plus, a $10-a-month paid version, remains primarily a hub for magazines; other news publishers have largely sat it out.
Apple’s service reportedly offered publishers only half the revenue it pulled in from subscriptions, divided according to how popular publishers were with readers.

327,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/fossil-trove-shows-lifes-fast-recovery-after-big-extinction/,"NEW YORK: A remarkable trove of fossils from Colorado has revealed details of how mammals grew larger and plants evolved after the cataclysm that killed the dinosaurs.
The thousands of specimens let scientists trace that history over a span of 1 million years, a mere eyeblink in Earth’s lifespan.
Sixty-six million years ago, a large meteorite smashed into what is now the Yucatan Peninsula of southeastern Mexico. It unleashed broiling waves of heat and filled the sky with aerosols that blotted out the sun for months, killing off plants and the animals that depended on them.
More than three-quarters of species on Earth died out.
But life came back, and land mammals began to expand from being small creatures into the wide array of forms we see today — including us.
So the new find taps into “the origin of the modern world,” said Tyler Lyson, an author of a paper reporting the fossil finds Thursday in the journal Science.
The fossils were recovered from an area of steep bluffs covering about 10 square miles (17 square kilometres) near Colorado Springs, starting three years ago.
Lyson, of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, found little in that area when he followed the standard practice of scanning for bits of bone. But that changed when he began looking instead for rocks that can form around bone. When the rocks were broken open, skulls and other fossils within were revealed.
Lyson said it’s not clear how wide a geographic region the fossils’ story of recovery applies to, but that he thinks they show what happened over North America.
“We just know so little about this everywhere on the globe,” he said. “At least now we have at one spot a fantastic record.”

Experts not connected to the study were enthusiastic.
It’s “an unparalleled documentary of how life on land recovered” after the asteroid impact, said P. David Polly of Indiana University in Bloomington. “The sheer number of fossil specimens and the quality of their preservation are exceptional” for this time period, he said.
The fossils’ story certainly represents what happened in central North America and perhaps more broadly, he wrote in an email.
Stephanie Smith of the Field Museum in Chicago said the study’s detailed focus on a single area can help scientists understand the complexity of recovery when combined with results from elsewhere.
Scientists have previously found little evidence about what happened in the aftermath of the meteorite crash, especially on land, said Jin Meng of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The new work, he said in an email, appears to provide “the best record on Earth to date.”
The study reports on hundreds of mammal fossils representing 16 species and more than 6,000 plant fossils. Researchers also analyzed thousands of pollen grains to see what plants were alive at various times. Analysis of leaves indicated several warming periods during the period.
Here’s the recovery story the fossils tell:
The area had been a forest before the meteorite hit, home to dinosaurs like T. rex and mammals no bigger than about 17 pounds (8 kilograms).
Soon after the disaster, the environment was blanketed with ferns and the biggest mammal around was about as heavy as a rat. The world was in a warming period, as documented in previous studies.
By about 100,000 years after the meteorite impact, the forest was dominated by palm trees and mammals had grown to the weight of raccoons, almost as big as before the meteorite crash. “That’s a pretty rapid recovery, or at least one aspect of recovery,” Lyson said.
By 300,000 years, the walnut tree family had diversified, and the biggest mammals were plant eaters about as heavy as a large beaver. Based on other studies of their diet, they may have evolved along with those trees, Lyson said.
By 700,000 years, the fossil record shows the first known appearance of legume plants, the family that includes peas and beans. And it reveals the two largest mammals found in the study, with the larger one weighing about 100 pounds (50 kilograms), roughly like a wolf. That is about 100 times heavier than the mammals that survived the extinction, “which I think is pretty fast” for growth, Lyson said.
What drove mammals to get bigger? The main factor was the disappearance of the dinosaurs, leaving an ecological niche to be filled, he said. But the quality and types of food on the landscape probably also played a role, he said. The simultaneous appearance of legume plants and bigger mammals suggests the plants may have provided a “protein bar moment,” Lyson said.
He said the mammals were creatures that evolved from animals that had survived extinction or those that immigrated from elsewhere.
Zhe-Xi Luo of the University of Chicago, who did not participate in the work, said the report is remarkable for tying together records for plants, mammals and temperature, giving a “holistic picture.”
Scientists expected mammals to recover after the dinosaur extinctions, he said, and the new work “is a huge step forward in getting a firm understanding about just how it happened.”

Able to crack random number problem in minutes
Breakthrough compared to first manned flight
IBM : Google hypes achievement, risks misleading public

BERLIN/SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Wednesday it had achieved a breakthrough in computing research by using a quantum computer to solve in minutes a complex problem that would take today’s most powerful supercomputer thousands of years to crack.

Google researchers expect that quantum computers within a few years will fuel advancements in fields such as artificial intelligence, materials science, and chemistry. The company is racing rivals including IBM Corp and Microsoft Corp to be the first to commercialize the technology and sell it through its cloud computing business.
“We’re hoping that when people start using this and looking at performance stability and cloud interface, they’ll get really excited about what we have to offer at Google,” John Martinis, the company’s chief scientist for quantum hardware, told reporters.
The breakthrough was described in a paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5#Sec4 published in science journal Nature. It followed weeks of controversy since a draft leaked over whether Google‘s claim of “quantum supremacy” was valid.
IBM said a supercomputer employing a different set-up could solve the same challenge in under three days, while chipmaker Intel said “quantum practicality” remained years away.
Google defended its position, but did not dispute rivals’ contentions. It has manufactured a handful of chips with 54 ‘qubits’, vastly more powerful than the standard 64-bit chip in many consumer devices. However, for the technology to be useful to customers it would need to make chips with thousands of qubits.
Martinis said Google sees “a pathway” to a computer with 1,000 qubits and expressed confidence that it had a reliable process to make its new chip, dubbed Sycamore.
The US and Chinese governments have led in the burgeoning quantum technology field, pledging billions of dollars in funding to corporate and state researchers to fast-track quantum development and mitigate possible issues, including the tech’s expected ability to break digital encryption.
Google has been among the beneficiaries of the American support. “The United States has taken a great leap forward in quantum computing,” said U.S. chief technology officer Michael Kratsios on Wednesday.

Long-held dream

For decades, computer scientists have sought to harness quantum physics, laws governing the behavior of particles that are smaller than atoms and can simultaneously exist in different states.
Quantum bits, or qubits, can be set to one and zero at the same time, unlike today’s computer bits that are either ones or zeros. This superposition property multiplies exponentially as qubits become entangled with each other, meaning the more qubits connected, the vastly more powerful a quantum computer becomes.
But there is a catch: Quantum researchers need to cool qubits to about absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius or -460 degrees Fahrenheit) to limit vibration – or “noise” – that causes errors in calculations. It is in this challenging task that Google, which has designed much of its own electronics and used liquid helium for cooling, has made significant progress.
CEO Sundar Pichai compared the achievement to building the first rocket to leave Earth’s atmosphere and touch the edge of space, an advance that brought interplanetary travel into the realm of the possible.
“For those of us working in science and technology, it’s the ‘hello world’ moment we’ve been waiting for – the most meaningful milestone to date in the quest to make quantum computing a reality,” Pichai wrote in a blog https://blog.google/perspectives/sundar-pichai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means.
Sycamore, measuring about 10 mm (0.39 inch) across, is made using aluminum and indium parts sandwiched between two silicon wafers. In their experiment this year, the researchers were able to get 53 of Sycamore’s qubits to interact in a quantum state.
They then had the quantum computer detect patterns in a series of seemingly random numbers, and it succeeded in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. They estimated that the same problem would take 10,000 years for a Summit supercomputer – the most powerful in the world today – to solve.

Hold on a qubit
While the peer-reviewed research has drawn plaudits, with MIT’s William D. Oliver comparing it to the Wright brothers’ first flights, skeptics say Google is over-selling its achievement.
IBM said a supercomputer with additional disk storage can solve the random number problem in at most 2-1/2 days and with greater accuracy. It also said Google risked misleading the public by implying the new-style computers would replace existing ones.
“Quantum computers will never reign ‘supreme’ over classical computers, but will rather work in concert with them, since each have their unique strengths,” Dario Gil, director of research at IBM, wrote in a blog https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy.
Torsten Siebert, manager of the quantum computing research program at Germany’s Fraunhofer Society, agreed that “progress was likely to be achieved through such hybrid combinations.”
Researchers also have expressed concern about quantum computers being used, for example, to unseal secure data and passwords or enable new forms of surveillance.
But before quantum computers can break codes, security experts have plenty of time to adapt, Martinis said.
“We’re pretty confident we’ll all stay safe and secure in the future,” he said.

329,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/is-the-stethoscope-dying-high-tech-rivals-pose-a-threat/,"
CHICAGO: Two centuries after its invention, the stethoscope — the very symbol of the medical profession — is facing an uncertain prognosis.

It is threatened by hand-held devices that are also pressed against the chest but rely on ultrasound technology, artificial intelligence and smartphone apps instead of doctors’ ears to help detect leaks, murmurs, abnormal rhythms and other problems in the heart, lungs and elsewhere. Some of these instruments can yield images of the beating heart or create electrocardiogram graphs.
Dr Eric Topol, a world-renowned cardiologist, considers the stethoscope obsolete, nothing more than a pair of “rubber tubes.”
It “was OK for 200 years,” Topol said. But “we need to go beyond that. We can do better.”
In a longstanding tradition, nearly every US medical school presents incoming students with a white coat and stethoscope to launch their careers. It’s more than symbolic — stethoscope skills are still taught, and proficiency is required for doctors to get their licenses.
Over the last decade, though, the tech industry has downsized ultrasound scanners into devices resembling TV remotes. It has also created digital stethoscopes that can be paired with smartphones to create moving pictures and readouts.

Proponents say these devices are nearly as easy to use as stethoscopes and allow doctors to watch the body in motion and actually see things such as leaky valves. “There’s no reason you would listen to sounds when you can see everything,” Topol said.
At many medical schools, it’s the newer devices that really get students’ hearts pumping.
“Wow!” ”Whoa!” ”This is awesome,” Indiana University medical students exclaimed in a recent class as they learned how to use a hand-held ultrasound device on a classmate, watching images of his lub-dubbing heart on a tablet screen.
The Butterfly iQ device, made by based by Guilford, Connecticut-based Butterfly Network Inc, went on the market last year. An update will include artificial intelligence to help users position the probe and interpret the images.
Students at the Indianapolis-based medical school, one of the nation’s largest, learn stethoscope skills but also get training in hand-held ultrasound in a programme launched there last year by Dr Paul Wallach, an executive associate dean. He created a similar programme five years ago at the Medical College of Georgia and predicts that within the next decade, hand-held ultrasound devices will become part of the routine physical exam, just like the reflex hammer.
The devices advance “our ability to take peek under the skin into the body,” he said. But Wallach added that, unlike some of his colleagues, he isn’t ready to declare the stethoscope dead. He envisions the next generation of physicians wearing “a stethoscope around the neck and an ultrasound in the pocket.”
Modern-day stethoscopes bear little resemblance to the first stethoscope, invented in the early 1800s by Frenchman Rene Laennec, but they work essentially the same way.
Laennec’s creation was a hollow tube of wood, almost a foot long, that made it easier to hear heart and lung sounds than pressing an ear against the chest. Rubber tubes, earpieces and the often cold metal attachment that is placed against the chest came later, helping to amplify the sounds.
When the stethoscope is pressed against the body, sound waves make the diaphragm — the flat metal disc part of the device — and the bell-shaped underside vibrate. That channels the sound waves up through the tubes to the ears. Conventional stethoscopes typically cost under $200, compared with at least a few thousand dollars for some of the high-tech devices.
But picking up and interpreting body sounds is subjective and requires a sensitive ear — and a trained one.
With medical advances and competing devices over the past few decades, “the old stethoscope is kind of falling on hard times in terms of rigorous training,” said Dr James Thomas, a cardiologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. “Some recent studies have shown that graduates in internal medicine and emergency medicine may miss as many of half of murmurs using a stethoscope.”
Northwestern is involved in testing new technology created by Eko, a Berkeley, California-based maker of smart stethoscopes. To improve detection of heart murmurs, Eko is developing artificial intelligence algorithms for its devices, using recordings of thousands of heartbeats. The devices produce a screen message telling the doctor whether the heart sounds are normal or if murmurs are present.
Dennis Callinan, a retired Chicago city employee with heart disease, is among the study participants. At age 70, he has had plenty of stethoscope exams but said he feels no nostalgia for the devices.
“If they can get a better reading using the new technology, great,” Callinan said.
Chicago paediatrician Dr Dave Drelicharz has been in practice for just over a decade and knows the allure of newer devices. But until the price comes down, the old stalwart “is still your best tool,” Drelicharz said. Once you learn to use the stethoscope, he said, it “becomes second nature.”
“During my work hours in my office, if I don’t have it around my shoulders,” he said, “it’s as though I was feeling almost naked.”

330,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/first-all-female-spacewalking-team-makes-history/,"CAPE CANAVERAL: The world’s first all-female spacewalking team made history high above Earth on Friday, replacing a broken part of the International Space Station’s power grid.
As NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir successfully completed the job with wrenches, screwdrivers and power-grip tools, it marked the first time in a half-century of spacewalking that men weren’t part of the action. They insisted they were just doing their job after years of training, following in the footsteps of women who paved the way.

America’s first female spacewalker from 35 years ago, Kathy Sullivan, was delighted. She said it’s good to finally have enough women in the astronaut corps and trained for spacewalking for this to happen.
“We’ve got qualified women running the control, running space centres, commanding the station, commanding spaceships and doing spacewalks,” Sullivan told The Associated Press earlier this week. “And golly, gee whiz, every now and then there’s more than one woman in the same place.”
President Donald Trump put in a congratulatory call from the White House to mark “this historic event … truly historic.”
“What you do is incredible. You’re very brave people,” Trump told them as they wrapped up their spacewalk.
Replied Meir: “We don’t want to take too much credit because there have been many others — female spacewalkers — before us. This is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time … For us, this is really just us doing our job.”
NASA leaders, Girl Scouts and others also cheered Koch and Meir on. Parents also sent in messages of thanks and encouragement via social media. NASA included some in its TV coverage. “Go girls go,” two young sisters wrote on a sign in crayon. A group of middle schoolers held a long sign reading “The sky is not the limit!!”
At the same time, many expressed hope this will become routine in the future.
Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a three-time spacewalker who looked on from Mission Control in Houston, added: “Hopefully, this will now be considered normal.”
NASA originally wanted to conduct an all-female spacewalk last spring but did not have enough medium-size suits ready to go until summer. Koch and Meir were supposed to install more new batteries in a spacewalk next week but ventured out three days earlier to deal with an equipment failure that occurred over the weekend. It was the second such failure of a battery charger this year, puzzling engineers and putting a hold on future battery installations for the solar power system.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine watched the big event unfold from Washington headquarters.
“We have the right people doing the right job at the right time,” he said. “They are an inspiration to people all over the world including me. And we’re very excited to get this mission underway.”
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sent congratulations to Koch and Meir “for leaving their mark on history” and tweeted that they’re an inspiration to women and girls across America.
The spacewalkers’ main job was to replace the faulty 19-year-old old charge-regulating device — the size of a big, bulky box — for one of the three new batteries that were installed last week by Koch and Andrew Morgan. As the seven-hour spacewalk drew to a close, Mission Control declared success, informing the astronauts that the new charger seemed to be working and the space station was back to full power. The women dragged in the broken unit so it can be returned to Earth early next year for analysis.
“Jessica and Christina, we are so proud of you,” said Morgan, one of four astronauts inside. He called them his “astrosisters.”
Spacewalking is widely considered the most dangerous assignment in orbit. Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, who operated the station’s robot arm from inside during Friday’s spacewalk, almost drowned in 2013 when his helmet flooded with water from his suit’s cooling system.
“Everyone ought to be sending some positive vibes by way of airwaves to space for these two top-notch spacewalkers,” Dyson said early in the spacewalk.
Meir, a marine biologist making her spacewalking debut, became the 228th person in the world to conduct a spacewalk and the 15th woman. It was the fourth spacewalk for Koch, an electrical engineer who is seven months into an 11-month mission that will be the longest ever by a woman. Both are members of NASA’s Astronaut Class of 2013, the only one equally split between women and men.
Pairing up for a spacewalk was especially meaningful for Koch and Meir; they’re close friends. They’re also both former Girl Scouts.
It took two decades for women to catch up with men in the spacewalking arena.
The world’s first spacewalker on March 18, 1965, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, died last week. NASA astronaut Ed White became the first US spacewalker less than three months after Leonov’s feat. Women did not follow out the hatch until 1984. The first was Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya. Sullivan followed three months later.
Friday’s milestone spacewalk was the 421st for team Earth.

331,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/us-astronauts-embark-on-the-first-all-female-spacewalk/,"US astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir made history on Friday when they stepped outside the International Space Station (ISS) on the first all-female spacewalk.
The much-anticipated milestone for NASA was achieved during a relatively routine mission to swap faulty batteries on the station’s exterior.
Koch and Meir, clad in white spacesuits and tethered by cords to the station some 254 miles (408 km) above Earth, stepped into outer space at 7:38 am Eastern time (1138 GMT) to replace a faulty power unit designed to help condition energy stored from the station’s solar panels, NASA announced online as it showed live video of the action.
The mission, expected to last nearly five hours, follows a first attempt at an all-female spacewalk in March. It was called off because one of the astronaut’s medium-sized spacesuits was not configured and ready for the journey.
Astronauts on the space station, which became operational in 2000, have tallied 221 maintenance spacewalks, 43 of which included women astronauts, according to NASA.
Friday’s spacewalk, formally called extravehicular activities, is in line with the US space agency’s aim to ramp up inclusivity in space.
Koch is scheduled set to complete the longest single space flight by a woman by remaining in orbit aboard the station until February 2020. She said gender milestones such as the spacewalk are significant.
“There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories from people who look like them, and I think that it’s an important aspect of the story to tell,” she said at a NASA briefing in Houston this month.
Sandra Magnus, a former NASA astronaut who spent 136 days on the International Space Station, told Reuters she did not want events like Friday’s spacewalk to become gimmicks.
“We want them to happen because people have the skill sets and they’re available to do the job,” said Magnus.
“On the other hand, it’s important for young women to see women role models doing extraordinary things,” she said. “So there’s two sides of the coin. You want it to be normal but yet you want it to be special.”

332,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/facebook-ceo-defends-refusal-to-take-down-some-content/,"WASHINGTON: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday defended the social media platform’s refusal to take down content it considers newsworthy “even if it goes against our standards.” But while he promoted free expression, limitations were place on coverage of his remarks at Georgetown University.
Reporters were not allowed to ask questions — only students were given that chance, filtered by a moderator. Facebook and Georgetown barred news organizations from filming. Instead organizers provided a livestream on Georgetown’s social media site and made available video shot by Facebook.
“It’s quite ironic,” said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute and a former state prosecutor. More generally, she said of Facebook, “The key to free expression is to not have one company control the flow of speech to more than 2 billion people, using algorithms that amplify disinformation in order to maximize profits.”
Facebook, Google, Twitter and other companies are trying to oversee internet content while also avoiding infringing on First Amendment rights. The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence. The shift follows mass shootings in which the suspects have posted racist screeds online or otherwise expressed hateful views or streamed images of attacks.
Facebook also has come under criticism for not doing enough to filter out phoney political ads.
“Right now, we’re doing a very good job at getting everyone mad at us,” Zuckerberg told the packed hall at Georgetown.
He said serious threats to expression are coming from places such as China, where social media platforms used by protesters are censored, and from court decisions restricting the location of internet users’ data in certain countries.
“I’m here today because I believe that we must continue to stand for free expression,” he said. People of varied political beliefs are trying to define expansive speech as dangerous because it could bring results they don’t accept, Zuckerberg said. “I personally believe this is more dangerous to democracy in the long term than almost any speech.”
Taking note of mounting criticism of the market dominance of Facebook and other tech giants, Zuckerberg acknowledged the companies’ centralized power but said it’s also “decentralized by putting it directly into people’s hands. … Giving people a voice and broader inclusion go hand in hand.”
John Stanton, a former fellow at Georgetown who heads a group called the “Save Journalism Project,” called the CEO’s appearance “a joke.”
Zuckerberg “is the antithesis of free expression,” Stanton said in a statement. “He’s thrown free speech, public education and democracy to the wayside in his thirst for power and profit.”
The social media giant, with nearly 2.5 billion users around the globe, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of data privacy scandals, including lapses in opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump’s 2016 campaign.
Facebook and other social media platforms have drawn accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that their platforms are steeped in anti-conservative bias.
Zuckerberg recently fell into a tiff with Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, who ran a fake political ad on Facebook taking aim at the CEO. Warren has proposed breaking up big tech companies. With the phoney ad, she was protesting Facebook’s policy of not fact-checking politicians’ speech or ads in the same way it enlists outside parties to fact-check news stories and other posts.
“We think people should be able to see for themselves,” Zuckerberg responded Thursday on the fact-checking issue. “If content is newsworthy, we don’t take it down even if it goes against our standards.”
The social media network also rebuffed requests that it remove a misleading video ad from Trump’s re-election campaign targeting Democrat Joe Biden.
A spokesman for Biden said Zuckerberg’s speech was an effort “to cloak Facebook’s policy in a feigned concern for free expression.”
“Facebook has chosen to sell Americans’ personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans,” campaign spokesman Bill Russo said in a statement.
Several of the students’ questions to Zuckerberg at Georgetown pointed up the conflict. One asked, if Facebook supports free speech, “why is conservative content disproportionately censored?” But another asserted that the policy of not fact-checking political ads is pro-conservative.
“I think it would be hard to be biased against both sides,” Zuckerberg replied, smiling.
Asked about the handling of questions, Facebook spokeswoman Ruchika Budhjara said, “They were submitted by students as they walked into the room. And they’re being picked at random by Georgetown.”

333,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-unveils-new-spacesuit-prototypes-for-missions/,"
WASHINGTON: NASA on Tuesday showed off two new spacesuits tailored for future moonwalking astronauts, signalling the development of a crucial component to the space agency’s accelerated drive to return to the moon by 2024.
Two NASA engineers strutted on a stage inside the agency’s Washington, DC headquarters, donning the new spacesuits, modelling and doing squats and crunches in front of a crowd of students and reporters to reveal what the first zero-gravity space-wear under NASA’s Artemis moon program would look like.

“This is the first suit we’ve designed in about 40 years,” Chris Hansen, a manager at NASA’s spacesuit design office, said.
“What you saw today was a prototype of the pressure garment. The life support system is back in a lab in Houston,” he said. “We want systems that allow our astronauts to be scientists on the surface of the moon”
The Trump administration in March directed NASA to land humans on the moon by 2024, accelerating a goal to colonize the moon as a staging ground for eventual missions to Mars.
One suit of orange fabric will be worn by astronauts when inside the spacecraft. Astronauts will wear a much bigger mostly white suit on the lunar surface.
The new suits make it much easier to walk, bend and squat when walking on the lunar surface, Amy Ross, NASA’s lead spacesuit engineer, said.
“Basically, my job is to take a basketball, shape it like a human, keep them alive in a harsh environment, and give them the mobility to do their job,” she said.
The new suits come as a much-needed upgrade to NASA’s astronaut wardrobe. Astronauts Christina Koch and Anne McClain were slated in March to conduct the first-ever all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station, but the mission was called off because there weren’t enough spacesuits available on the station for both of them.
Another attempt for the first all-female spacewalk, a roughly six-hour crawl on the exterior of the space station to install new batteries, is back on for Thursday, NASA said in a news release on Tuesday.

334,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/despite-defections-facebook-officially-launches-libra/,"NEW YORK: Facebook officially moved forward with its plans Monday to create a new digital currency called Libra, despite several high-profile defections from the project and intense criticism from US regulators and politicians.
The Libra Association, the nonprofit that will govern the currency, officially signed on 21 charter members on Monday at the organization’s inaugural meeting in Geneva. Originally the Libra Association had 27 potential members, but several companies dropped out in recent days, including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal.
Most of the remaining members of the Libra Association consist of venture capital firms, who often have an eye on emerging technologies and align with Facebook’s interests, as well as nonprofits. But some larger companies who are now members of the association include Uber, Lyft, Spotify and European telecommunications company Vodafone. The association said in a statement that an unnamed additional 180 entities have expressed interest and have met the initial requirements to join.
Facebook has faced criticism since the summer when it unveiled plans to create a separate, private currency system to allow users to make cross-border payments more easily. Politicians have said they believe Facebook’s struggles with protecting users’ privacy would spill over into Libra, despite it being a separate organization.
The Menlo Park, California-based company tried to answer those criticisms by creating Libra as a legally separate entity through the Libra Association, and by not owning Libra itself. But Facebook is still involved, even at an arm’s length. The association elected David Marcus, a Facebook executive and co-creator of Libra, as one of the association’s five directors. Katie Haun with Andreessen Horowitz, one of the VC firms that invested in Facebook before it went public, was elected to the board as well.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear in front of the House Financial Services Committee later this month to discuss Libra. That committee is chaired by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, who has been an ardent critic of Libra from its onset.
Facebook and the Libra Association have said they would not start trading or accepting deposits for Libra until they satisfy US regulators concerns. Dante Disparte, Libra’s head of policy and communications, said that the association is now in active talks with regulators to get approval. Facebook has also hired several Washington lobbyists to help alieve regulator and political concerns over Libra.
The other three directors elected to the association’s board were Matthew Davie of Kiva Microfunds, Patrick Ellis with PayU and Wences Casares of Xapo Holdings Ltd.

335,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-launches-satellite-to-explore-where-air-meets-space/,"CAPE CANAVERAL: NASA launched a satellite on Thursday night to explore the mysterious, dynamic region where air meets space.
The satellite — called Icon, short for Ionospheric Connection Explorer — rocketed into orbit following a two-year delay. It was dropped from a plane flying over the Atlantic off the Florida coast.
Five seconds after the satellite’s release, the attached Pegasus rocket ignited, sending Icon on its way.
The ionosphere is the charged part of the upper atmosphere extending several hundred miles (kilometres) up. It’s in constant flux as space weather bombards it from above and Earth weather from below, sometimes disrupting radio communications.
“This protected layer, it’s the top of our atmosphere. It’s our frontier with space,” said NASA’s heliophysics division director, Nicola Fox.
Fox said there’s too much going on in this region to be caused by just the sun. Hurricanes, tornadoes and other extreme weather conditions on Earth are also adding energy, she noted.
The more scientists know, the better spacecraft and astronauts can be protected in orbit through improved forecasting.
The refrigerator-size Icon satellite will study the airglow formed from gases in the ionosphere and also measure the charged environment right around the 360-mile-high (580-kilometre-high) spacecraft.
“It’s a remarkable physics laboratory,” said principal scientist Thomas Immel of the University of California, Berkeley, which is overseeing the two-year mission. He added: “Icon goes where the action is.”
A NASA satellite launched last year, Gold, is also studying the upper atmosphere, but from much higher up. More missions are planned in coming years to study the ionosphere, including from the International Space Station.
Icon should have soared in 2017, but problems with Northrop Grumman’s air-launched Pegasus rocket interfered. Despite the long delay, NASA said the $252 million mission did not exceed its price cap. Northrop Grumman also built the satellite.
During a news conference earlier this week, NASA launch director Omar Baez apologized for the delay.
“We wanted to get things right on this rocket,” Baez said. “We have no second chances on these type of missions.”
He called the launch “an awesome and great one; this one’s been a long time in coming.”
Baez said in the end, everything went well. “This is about as good as it gets,” he said.

336,https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/subash-tamang-rise-from-the-ashes-to-glory/,"Kathmandu, December 20
The story of Subash Tamang’s rise from the ashes to glory is no less than a drama. In fact, it is a resolute struggle of a layman in breaking barriers into the rich man’s game — golf. At the age of 17, the double gold medallist of the 13th South Asian Games, Tamang is already a star. He bagged Nepal’s maiden gold medal in SA Games golf tournament and also led the men’s team to first position.
Tamang achieved the rare feat of winning two gold medals in a single meet, standing tall along with karateka Manday Kaji Shrestha and taekwondo player Ayasha Shakya. Swimmer Gaurika Singh later broke all records by winning four gold medals. The lean and thin underprivileged kid from a remote part of Lalitpur district — currently Konjyosom Rural Municipality, some 40 kilometres south of the capital — had already entered history books.

And the success did not come overnight. Born in a poor family, Tamang went through series of struggles and nightmares as well. At the age of nine, Tamang was sent to Kathmandu to help his mother’s younger sister in raising the new-born baby and that was a point from where he drew his path towards glory.
Tamang’s life took a decisive turn when he entered the Royal Nepal Golf Club, albeit for a different purpose. His cousin brother, Binod Tamang worked there and he was supposed to deliver food to him. But destiny had other ideas. RNGC Head Pro Deepak Thapa Magar offered Tamang a much-needed job — a ball boy. “He just nodded his head in acceptance and started the duty from the next day,” remembers Thapa Magar. Shy by nature and small in size, Tamang kept on picking up the ball for two years. He would hit the ball whenever he got chance and Tamang fell in love with the sport he had never heard of. “As a kid I was allowed to hit the ball and gradually I started enjoying it,” says Subash.
One fine day, Nepal Golf Association President Tashi Ghale saw Tamang hitting the ball at the RNGC driving range and he was impressed with the young boy’s swing. Ghale inquired about Subash with Thapa Magar and they decided to try him out in junior camp.
“Tamang had a good swing and I was amazed by his skills,” says Ghale. Tamang did well at the camp but his physique was something to worry about. “We provided him adequate food along with supplements and that worked,” says Thapa Magar.

The NGA allowed him to take part in amateur tournaments. Subash stood firm in almost every event he took part and that was enough for him to take a huge stride in his career. Impressed with his performance and dedication, NGA sent Tamang to various international tournaments and the golfer became a key member in the national team.
After the inclusion of golf in the 13th South Asian Games, Ghale wanted to field a strong team as he had announced to resign from the post in case of failure to win gold medal. The NGA nominated Thapa Magar and Army pro Dhana Bahadur Thapa as the coaches, while Australian PGA Instructor Kim Baldwin assessed the golfers a month before the SA Games.

The golfing fraternity was pinning hopes on Sukra Bahadur Rai and Tanka Bahadur Karki but it was Tamang who stole the show. “I think there are lots of turning points in my life. Going to Kathmandu with a different purpose to getting a job of ball boy at the RNGC and then getting picked up by Tashi sir for junior camp all carry significant importance,” says Tamang. “I believe the success in SA Games has given me a new life,” he adds.
Now Tamang wants to do two things apart from playing golf — build a house for his parents and give proper education to younger brother Arjun. “I want to build a house first as my parents are facing a lot of problems in the hut,” says Subash. “And I want my brother study in a boarding school so that he can lead a better life,” he adds. “If I complete these responsibilities, I can focus on my career. After playing for the country as an amateur golfer for few more years, I will try my hands in the Indian Tour and beyond.”

Liverpool did not disclose the fee but British media have reported that his release clause was 7.25 million pounds ($9.30 million) and that the 24-year-old would officially join from the Austrian club on Jan. 1.
“It has been a dream, my dream to become a Liverpool player. And I’m so excited that the moment has come true,” Minamino told Liverpool‘s website in a statement.
“To play in the Premier League was one of my targets. I was thinking if my career as a footballer progressed smoothly, someday I would be able to play in the Premier League.
“But I never thought I would be able to play in this team and I’m really happy about it.”
Minamino, who has scored 11 goals in 22 matches for Japan, previously played for Cerezo Osaka in the Japanese top flight.

BERLIN: Bayern Munich‘s Joshua Zirkzee and Serge Gnabry scored stoppage-time goals to give the Bundesliga champions a 3-1 win at Freiburg on Wednesday, while Borussia Moenchengladbach joined RB Leipzig at the top of the table with a 2-0 win over Paderborn.
Bayern looked set to drop points until Zirkzee scored his first Bundesliga goal a minute after coming on as a substitute, with Gnabry making sure of the victory.
The win, however, could not mask Bayern‘s defensive weaknesses, with the team having now conceded at least one goal in their last four league games.
Bayern got off to a strong start, hitting the post through Thomas Mueller before Robert Lewandowski’s 19th league goal of the season gave them the lead in the 16th minute.
Freiburg, however, gradually gained control of the midfield, attacking with greater ease as the Bavarians were punished once more for their complacency.
Vincenzo Grifo volleyed in to level on the hour, completing a superb attacking move from the hosts, who missed several more scoring chances as the Bayern defence looked shaky.
Late substitute Zirkzee, the 18-year-old Dutch youth international, then slipped into the box and slotted in from close range before Gnabry added another.
Bayern are third on 30 points, ahead of fourth-placed Borussia Dortmund on goal difference. The Bundesliga will break after this weekend’s action and will resume in mid-January following its traditional winter pause.
“It was a game with many ups and downs. Fortunately, with a happy finish in the end,” Bayern interim coach Hans Flick told reporters. “At the end we had a bit of luck. Freiburg played well, they put us under pressure.”
On his decision to bring on Zirkzee in stoppage time, Flick said he wanted the Dutchman to be in the mix should a cross be floated into the box.
“I thought if a cross comes in then he could put it in. He has been with us (from the reserves) for the past three weeks and his development is very noticeable.”
Second-half goals from Alassane Plea and Lars Stindl gave Glabdach a comfortable 2-0 win over visiting Paderborn and lifted them to 34 points, second on goal difference behind RB Leipzig.

TOKYO: Tokyo Olympics organisers said on Friday it has yet to be decided who will foot the bill for moving the 2020 marathon and race walking events to the northern city of Sapporo.
Organisers said the Games were expected to cost some 1.35 trillion yen ($12.35 billion), which is in keeping with last year’s version of the budget, but that that figure did not include an estimated three billion yen for moving the events.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) stunned Games organisers in October by announcing the marathon would be moved to Sapporo to avoid the worst of Tokyo’s summer heat.
“For the additional fee, of course we need to discuss with the IOC,” said Tokyo 2020’s finance director Gakuji Ito.
“So, if the IOC agrees to take the burden then they will. If there is any part IOC is not covering the fee and TOCOG has to bear, then I think we will use the contingency (fund).”
A 27 billion yen contingency fund included in the budget has been set aside for potential natural disasters during the event, such as the typhoon that disrupted the Rugby World Cup in October.

A decision is expected to be made in the New Year.
“We do have a contingency budget allocated so this is the amount we have included as an expenditure,” said Ito.
“However, this is not just for the Sapporo issue, it would be for any large size typhoons that occur before the competition or things we need to handle before the Games.
“These are things we are not able to forecast so if unexpected things were to occur then it might exceed 1.35 trillion yen.”
Tokyo 2020’s budget is split between the organising committee and local and national governments.
Organisers say the national government was expected to pay some 150 billion yen – mainly for funding of the new National Stadium – but the expenditure at a national level has been the source of some debate.
A report from Japan’s Board of Audit earlier this month put national government spending on the Olympics between the bid in 2013 and 2018 at 1.06 trillion yen.
However, Tokyo 2020 said the disparity was down to different “definitions of Games-related” costs.
“It was not segregated between Games-related expenses and any other not directly related items,” said Ito, who added further clarification was expected from the Board of Audit next year.
The Tokyo Olympics run from July 24 to Aug. 9.

LONDON: Manchester City remained on course to lift the League Cup for a third successive season after overcoming third-tier Oxford United 3-1 on Wednesday and will face Manchester United in the semi-finals.
Pep Guardiola’s side were given a stern test on a wet and windy night at a noisy Kassam Stadium but two goals from Raheem Sterling eventually saw them through.

United were frustrated for 51 minutes at Old Trafford by fourth-tier Colchester United but England striker Marcus Rashford broke the resistance and an own goal by Ryan Jackson and one for Anthony Martial took the hosts to a 3-0 win.
Of a two-legged semi-final in January, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: “Fantastic days in Manchester. You always want to win trophies and games and we have a nice little draw coming up, exciting times ahead.”
Leicester City squandered a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 at Everton but moved through to the semi-finals after Jamie Vardy scored the decisive spot-kick in the penalty shootout.
Brendan Rodgers’s side will face Midlands rivals Aston Villa in the semi-finals after Villa beat a virtual Liverpool youth team 5-0 on Tuesday. Liverpool’s senior players were all in action on Wednesday in their FIFA Club World Cup victory over Monterrey.
City have dominated the League Cup under Guardiola but rarely have they been tested quite like they were by Oxford who managed 18 goal attempts, more than any side against City since the Spaniard took charge.
City made eight changes to the team that beat Arsenal on Sunday and lacked their usual authority but they did take the lead in the 22nd minute with Joao Cancelo’s deflected effort.
CAUGHT NAPPING
They were caught napping, however, when Matty Taylor rammed home an equaliser 22 seconds into the second half.
Sterling restored City’s lead in the 50th minute, touching in Angelino’s cross, but Oxford took charge for a 20-minute spell in which they outplayed their illustrious guests.
City keeper Claudio Bravo made a succession of saves but substitute Gabriel Jesus broke clear and squared for Sterling to seal it in the 70th minute — his 18th goal of the season for his club.
Mikel Arteta, favourite to get the vacant Arsenal job, took his place next to Guardiola on the City bench in what could be his final game as assistant manager.
Guardiola would not be drawn on that situation.
“We suffered a lot in the second half. At 2-1 they play long balls with throw-ins, corners and we struggled but it’s okay, we knew before we came here,” Guardiola said.
“We play against a top side so congratulations for the team, young players and the victory.”
Oxford manager Karl Robinson said he was “frustrated” that his side had not taken their chances.
“I am really pleased with the players but my last thought tonight will be ‘what could have been’.”
Leicester led with first-half goals by James Maddison and Jonny Evans but Tom Davies halved the deficit before a Leighton Baines screamer made it 2-2 in the 90th minute.
Everton’s hopes of a glorious comeback victory in Duncan Ferguson’s third game as caretaker manager went flat, though, as Kasper Schmeichel made two saves in the shootout.
Leicester are in the League Cup semi-finals for the first time since the 1999-2000 campaign, when they won the trophy.

“The German player Ozil posted an extreme statement about China on social media,” NetEase said in a statement on Weibo on Wednesday.
“The speech hurt the feelings of Chinese fans and violated the sports spirit of love and peace. We do not understand, accept or forgive this.”
Ozil, a German Muslim of Turkish origin, posted messages of social media last week calling minority Uighurs “warriors who resist persecution” and criticised both China’s crackdown and the silence of Muslims in response.
China’s foreign ministry said Ozil was “deceived by fake news” as social media platforms in the country such as Weibo were flooded with angry messages.
Arsenal were quick to distance themselves from Ozil’s comments, saying the club “always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics”.
Ozil has received support from former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who defended the player’s right to express his opinion.

MILAN: A superb Cristiano Ronaldo header sent Juventus three points clear at the top of Serie A with a 2-1 victory at Sampdoria on Wednesday as Gianluigi Buffon matched the league appearance record.


Paulo Dybala’s exquisite volley put the champions in front before Gianluca Caprari levelled, but a remarkable leap and towering header from Ronaldo on the brink of halftime proved decisive.

Ronaldo was denied his second goal by the offside flag late on, before Samp scorer Caprari was sent off in stoppage time when he was shown a second yellow card.
“The whole team showed the right attitude,” Ronaldo told Sky Italia. “It was a good goal and I am glad to help the team with another three points.
“I had problems with my knee for a month, but that has gone now and I feel good physically.”
It was a special night for Buffon as the veteran goalkeeper equalled Paolo Maldini’s record of 647 Serie A appearances and set a new Juventus Serie A appearance record of 479 games, one more than Alessandro Del Piero.
Juventus top the table with 42 points, although second-placed Inter (39) have a game in hand, while Sampdoria are 17th on 15 points.
Sarri fielded the attacking trident of Ronaldo, Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain for the second game in a row, and his side needed 19 minutes to find the opener as Dybala struck a sublime volley into the bottom corner.
Sampdoria drew level 10 minutes before the break when Caprari swept a finish past Buffon after a defensive mix-up.
Juve, however, went back in front through an extraordinary Ronaldo header. The Portuguese was calculated to have jumped 71 centimetres off the ground to meet Sandro’s cross at a height of 2.56 metres, before powering home.
“Ronaldo did something that you see in the NBA (National Basketball Association), he was up in the air for an hour and a half,” said Sampdoria coach Claudio Ranieri.
“There’s nothing you can say about it, you can only congratulate him and move on.”
Ronaldo, who has six goals in his last five Juventus appearances, thought he had his second when he rounded goalkeeper Emil Audero to roll the ball into an empty net, but the effort was disallowed for offside.
The game ended on a sour note for Ranieri’s side as Caprari caught Merih Demiral in the face with a flailing arm to earn a second yellow card.
Juventus head to Saudi Arabia this week, where they will face Coppa Italia holders Lazio in the Supercoppa Italiana in Riyadh on Sunday ahead of the winter break, which runs until the first weekend of January.
Later on Wednesday, goals from Hamed Traore and Francesco Caputo either side of halftime gave Sassuolo a 2-0 win away to Brescia.
The win lifts Roberto De Zerbi’s side into 11th place on 19 points, while Brescia remain in the relegation zone, in 18th with 13 points.

Liverpool’s Firmino snatches late winner
Virgil van Dijk missed game through illness
Keita scored early for Liverpool, Funes Mori levelled

DOHA: Substitute Roberto Firmino grabbed a stoppage-time winner as Liverpool beat Mexico’s Monterrey 2-1 on Wednesday to reach the Club World Cup final, where they will play Brazil’s Flamengo.
Liverpool, without centre back Virgil van Dijk, who was missing through illness and with Firmino and Sadio Mane starting on the bench, never truly imposed themselves on the game but their trademark perseverance paid off and earned them a place in Saturday’s final.

“They fought really hard, we had problems before the game and during the game as well but I think the boys did exceptionally well,” said Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp.
It was a cruel ending though for Monterrey who played with discipline and brightness on the counter-attack and could have enjoyed a famous night had it not been for the alertness of Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker.
With Dejan Lovren and Joel Matip injured, Klopp had to ask midfielder Jordan Henderson to fill in for Van Dijk alongside Joe Gomez in the centre of a makeshift defence.
There were also starts for Xherdan Shaqiri and Divock Origi in attack, as Klopp began with two-thirds of his usual attacking trident on the bench, presumably with Saturday’s final in mind.
Liverpool got off to the ideal start when they took a 12th-minute lead as Mohamed Salah split the Monterrey defence with a clever reverse pass which Naby Keita raced on to and confidently slotted home.
The lead, however, lasted only two minutes as Liverpool’s defence failed to deal effectively with a high ball into the box. A shot from Jesus Gallardo was blocked, but the ball fell to Rogelio Funes Mori who fired home to make it 1-1.
Liverpool’s Alisson Becker was the busier of the two goalkeepers, twice foiling the dangerous Colombian winger Dorlan Pabon before the break.
Pabon was again a threat after the interval with Becker at full stretch to keep out his sweetly-struck free kick and the Brazilian keeper also did well with a long-range effort from Funes Mori.
Yet with the game heading for extra-time, Firmino, who only came on in the 85th minute, settled the encounter.
The Brazilian turned in a low cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold at the near post, after good work from Salah, who kept the ball alive before bringing the right back into the game.
It was a cruel end for an impressive Monterrey whose coach Antonio Mohamed felt they had merited more.
“We deserved a positive result, we honoured Mexican football. We were competing to win but we lost concentration in the final minutes and conceded,” he said.
“I am proud of the way we honoured our town and country – we lost with honour and dignity and looking forward to the Mexican league.”
Monterrey face a two-legged Liga MX playoff final against Club America on Dec. 26 and 29.
Saturday’s final will mark a repeat of the 1981 Intercontinental Cup, the tournament’s forerunner, when a Zico inspired Flamengo beat Liverpool 3-0 in Tokyo.

They also had two penalty appeals turned down and Gareth Bale had an effort ruled narrowly offside as the fixture ended scoreless for the first time since November, 2002, when Luis Figo had a pig’s head thrown at him by Barca fans who felt betrayed by him leaving the Catalans to join Real.
Play was briefly halted on Wednesday when beach balls were hurled on to the pitch by fans in protest against the lengthy jail sentences handed to Catalan separatist leaders two months ago.
The game had been rescheduled from Oct. 26 due to the political turmoil that gripped Catalonia in the aftermath of those sentences and was played amid a protest near the stadium attended by several thousand people.
Loud chants of “independence” and “freedom” greeted kick-off while many supporters held up flags reading “Spain Sit and Talk” which had been distributed by protest organisers in a call for dialogue between the central government and Catalonia.
The action on the pitch did not quite live up to the tense atmosphere in the stands, however, as Barca failed to get going throughout the game and Real bossed the first half.
PENALTY APPEALS
Zinedine Zidane’s side fired 12 shots at the hosts’ goal before the interval, coming closest with a Casemiro header which Gerard Pique scrambled off the goalline, while they also had two penalty appeals waved away for challenges on Raphael Varane.
Real captain Sergio Ramos said his side were unfortunate not to earn a spot-kick.
“Today we saw a great Real Madrid side with a lot of character which is exactly the image we wanted to give. We went out to try and take the ball off them and we created a lot of chances,” he told reporters.
“We watched the penalty appeals at halftime and they seemed pretty clear, they are both penalties but we can’t change that. VAR is there to help but today we didn’t get that bit of luck.”
Barca looked short of ideas, with Lionel Messi being their only source of inspiration.
The Argentine could have broken the deadlock in the first half but Ramos slid to the floor to block his goal-bound shot.
Messi later teed up Jordi Alba with a scooped pass but the defender fired just wide, while Barca’s all-time top scorer was uncharacteristically sloppy at times and miscontrolled a clear opportunity to strike at goal in the second half.
Midfielder Ivan Rakitic admitted Barca had struggled for parts of the match.
“Real Madrid had a lot of chances in the first half, it was tough for us but then we had a few opportunities. It was a game that could have been decided by the odd goal but it wasn’t to be,” said the Croatian.
“We’re happy with how we played, but we just lacked that final touch of quality.”

MUMBAI: Kumar Sangakkara will lead a Marylebone Cricket Club side on their tour of Lahore in February to help Pakistan in their bid to convince touring sides to return to play test cricket in the country, the club said on Wednesday.
The MCC, which was founded in 1787, will play a number of matches in the city in February after its World Cricket Committee voiced support in seeing touring sides return to Pakistan at meeting held at Lord’s in August.
Pakistan is currently hosting Sri Lanka in a two-match series, their first tests on home soil since the 2009 militant attack on Sri Lanka’s team bus in Lahore left six security personnel and two civilians dead and six players injured.
Other teams refused to travel to Pakistan due to security concerns and the side were forced to play home tests at neutral venues in the United Arab Emirates.
The PCB promised watertight security for the Sri Lankan players as the team returned to play several limited overs matches earlier this year – though 10 key players opted out citing security concerns.
A full-strength Sri Lankan side, however, returned for the tests, the first of which was drawn in Rawalpindi.
Former Sri Lanka captain Sangakkara, who took over as the first non-British president of the MCC in October in a one-year post, said he was excited to lead the club side in Pakistan.
“It is hugely important to support cricket in countries such as Pakistan, and the PCB has done a tremendous job in rebuilding the international cricketing landscape since the tragic events of 2009,” he said in a statement.
“With international cricket having returned for the first time in a decade, it is wonderful the Club is doing its part to strengthen cricket in Pakistan and I look forward to being part of the trip.”
MCC works closely with world governing body International Cricket Council and undertakes overseas tours, where they play exhibition matches to help in the development of the game.
PCB Chief Executive Wasim Khan welcomed the decision of MCC, which has been based at Lord’s, which it owns, since 1814 and is the custodian of the Laws of the game.
“The decision by the world’s oldest and most influential cricket club to send a quality team is further testament that Pakistan is as safe and secure a country as any other cricket-playing nation in the world, and MCC’s tour is a further step forward in normalising team tours to Pakistan,” he said.

LONDON: Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum has been ruled out of Wednesday’s FIFA Club World Cup semi-final against Mexican side Monterrey due to a muscle injury, manager Juergen Klopp said.
Wijnaldum was injured in Liverpool‘s 2-0 Premier League win over Watford on Saturday but travelled with the squad to Qatar.
Klopp said that the 29-year-old’s problem was not as serious as initially feared but that they would monitor how it responded to treatment over the coming days.
“Gini was not as serious as we thought in the first moment, so he’s here doing the first recovery and then we have stuff what is necessary,” Klopp told reporters on Tuesday.
“We’ll see day by day, but for tomorrow night (Wednesday) he’s not involved.”
Wijnaldum’s fellow Dutch international Virgil van Dijk also missed training in Doha on Monday but Klopp said the defender was not carrying any injury.
“Virgil is fine. We had to do different stuff for recovery for different people, that was the reason why he wasn’t involved yesterday in the session,” Klopp added.
“All the rest of the squad is fine.”
European champions Liverpool are looking to capture their maiden Club World Cup trophy.
The winner of Wednesday’s clash at the Khalifa International Stadium will take on Copa Libertadores champions Flamengo in Saturday’s final.
With Premier League leaders Liverpool playing in Doha this week, they fielded a starting lineup consisting mainly of reserves and youth team players for Tuesday’s League Cup semi-final against Aston Villa.
They acquitted themselves well against a more experienced Villa side but were beaten 5-0.

Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said he expected a “quick decision” on assistant Mikel Arteta’s future, confirming his fellow Spaniard was in talks to take the vacant Arsenal job.
Guardiola said Arteta will be at Oxford United on Wednesday for City’s League Cup quarter-final but appears resigned to the prospect of losing his right-hand man.
“I think it (the decision) is going to happen quick,” Guardiola was quoted as saying by the BBC. “Why not? It’s a good argument.”
Former Arsenal captain Arteta is the leading candidate to succeed Unai Emery as Arsenal manager after the London club’s chief executive Vinai Venkatesham was pictured outside the 37-year-old’s house in the early hours of Monday morning.

“Mikel is travelling to Oxford with us tomorrow,” Guardiola earlier told reporters. We were so smart to pick him up and the other clubs missed it. He’s an incredible person, good manager. Work ethic. That’s why he is what he is.
“He’s talking with Arsenal so I don’t know. Now he is part of our group and staff and he is here. When we have new news, I will know and you will know. Now he is here, tomorrow travelling. He trained today and that’s all.”
Spaniard Arteta made 149 appearances for Arsenal before joining City’s coaching staff in 2016 where he has enjoyed a successful spell as assistant to Guardiola, helping the club to consecutive Premier League titles over the last two seasons.
Guardiola said he had spoken to Arteta about the Arsenal opportunity and would not stand in his way.
“I am a guy who lets people live with freedom and do what they want because that is what they want in the moment, for their lives, family, professionally and individually,” he said.
“Mikel knows exactly what we think about him. After that, we cannot do more.”

Werner scores twice for Leipzig
Dortmund twice give up lead
Leipzig stay top

BERLIN: Borussia Dortmund squandered a two-goal lead to draw 3-3 with Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig on Tuesday as a series of errors caused the Ruhr valley club to lose their grip on the game.
Dortmund, who led 2-0 and 3-2, had only themselves to blame as they failed to close the gap to the top, staying four points behind Leipzig in third place.

Dortmund, having won their previous three league games, looked to be cruising to victory when Julian Weigl fired in to give them the lead in the 23rd minute.
Julian Brandt then added a second after a stunning 180-degree turn in the box in the 34th, as the visitors were completely outclassed in the first half.
Leipzig twice went close in first-half stoppage time, forcing two consecutive fine saves from Dortmund’s Roman Buerki.
Yet the Swiss keeper was beaten two minutes after the restart when he tried to head the ball away outside his box, but failed to get enough distance on his clearance and instead allowed Timo Werner to sneak in and score.
Werner then added a second in the 53rd, after a mistake from Brandt, to take his league goal tally to 18, joining Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski as top scorer, but Jadon Sancho put the hosts back in front two minutes later.
Dortmund looked to be back in control until Patrik Schick was left unmarked to stab in the equaliser on the rebound in the 78th.
“We did not do it well in the second half,” said Dortmund captain Marco Reus. “All three goals could have been avoided.
“It was a good game from both but a point from this game is far too little for us.”
Leipzig stay top on 34 points, with second-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, who host bottom club Paderborn on Wednesday, on 31. Dortmund are third on 30 while champions Bayern Munich are in fifth on 27 and travel to Freiburg on Wednesday.

Aston Villa beat Liverpool’s youngest-ever side 5-0 with a double by Jonathan Kodjia helping them into the League Cup semi-finals on a strange night at Villa Park on Tuesday.
With runaway Premier League leaders Liverpool playing in FIFA’s Club World Cup 24 hours later in Doha, they fielded a starting lineup consisting mainly of reserves and youth team players with an average age of 19.4, a club record.

While they acquitted themselves well against a more experienced Villa side, which showed 10 changes from the weekend Premier League defeat by Sheffield United, they were taught a harsh lesson in Liverpool’s heaviest League Cup defeat.
The Merseyside club’s senior players and manager Juergen Klopp, watching on TV in Qatar where they face Monterrey in the semis on Wednesday, would have been impressed over the way their team started with 16-year-old Harvey Elliott catching the eye.
But Villa took the lead in the 14th minute when Conor Hourihane’s free kick went through a crowded area and into the net with Kodjia initially claiming a touch.
Morgan Boyes, one of five Liverpool debutants to start, deflected Ahmed Elmohamady’s free kick over his own keeper Caoimhin Kelleher three minutes later before 30-year-old Kodjia ran through on his own to slot home the third goal in the 37th.
Villa’s Ivory Coast striker Kodjia made it 4-0 from close range just before halftime to end the tie as a contest, although Liverpool carved out several good chances after the break with some neat build-up play.
Villa added a fifth goal in stoppage time with record signing Wesley finishing clinically, having been sent clear by Trezeguet after coming off the bench.
HOLLOW VICTORY
Villa have reached the semi-finals for the first time since the 2012-13 season but the victory felt hollow.
Liverpool have won the League Cup a record eight times but sacrificed the chance of making it nine as they focused on the game in Doha against Mexican club Monterrey.
Questions will be asked about their decision to involve no senior players and the scheduling but despite the scoreline Liverpool had more shots and more possession than Villa.
Liverpool’s Under-23 manager Neil Critchley, in charge fo the team in Klopp’s absence, said his players, who had only 16 first-team appearances between them, had been magnificent.
“We were fantastic from the start, we had a couple of chances from the first whistle,” he said.
“We were really unfortunate to concede and find ourselves 2-0 down. It was an incredible night and no one wanted it to end. The support we had was unbelievable.
“Some of them showed the potential to one day play for us, or in the Premier League. They will know it was just part of their journey. My overwhelming feeling was of immense pride.”
The other three quarter-finals take place on Wednesday with holders Manchester City at third-tier Oxford United, Manchester United hosting fourth-tier Colchester United and Everton at home to Leicester City.

SYDNEY: Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis were left out of the Australia squad for next month’s limited overs tour of India on Tuesday as Marnus Labuschagne was handed a chance to earn his first one-day cap.
Australia return to the 50-overs format for the first time since their World Cup semi-final loss to England in July when they play three day-night matches in India in January.
Aaron Finch will captain the side but coach Justin Langer will not make the trip, with senior assistant coach Andrew McDonald taking charge in his stead.
Maxwell and Stoinis both played in the World Cup semi-final despite enjoying disappointing tournaments as Australia looked to them to power the middle order.
Labuschagne comes into the squad on the back of some fine form in test cricket with big centuries in his last three matches for Australia.
Also getting a chance to stake a claim for a spot in the middle order was Ashton Turner, who smashed a brilliant unbeaten 43-ball 84 to help Australia to victory during his debut one-day series in India early this year.
“We … believe Marnus Labuschagne is ready for his international white ball debut after his strong form for Queensland in this form of the game,” said head selector Trevor Hohns.
“Ashton Turner has proven himself in India with his ability to adapt to local conditions.”
Maxwell recently returned to Twenty20 cricket after taking six weeks off from the game to deal with mental health issues but said last week he was targeting a return to international cricket for the tour.
“It is great to see Glenn Maxwell returning to the game in the Big Bash League,” Hohns said.
“We will closely monitor his form after what would have been a disappointing 12 months in the one-day game by his standards.”
Adam Zampa was included in the squad despite having lost his place as front-line spinner at the World Cup to Nathan Lyon, who will not tour but remains in the frame for future selection.
Sean Abbott joins the usual suspects in the pace bowling unit with a chance to add a second one-day cap to the one he won against Pakistan more than five years ago.
Hohns said the selectors were keen to use the series to continue preparations for the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia at the end of 2020 as well as keeping an eye on developing talent for the 2023 50-overs World Cup in India.
Squad: Aaron Finch, Sean Abbott, Ashton Agar, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschagne, Kane Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Ashton Turner, David Warner, Adam Zampa

Thanking the Yeti Airlines for its continuous support, HSC President Sherpa said the agreement would help the club in its bid to finish in top four. “We have not prepared the team to win the league this time around as we have retained around 80 per cent players and added young ones in the squad,” said Sherpa. “We have become a kind of supplier and we feel proud to see the footballers produced by our club playing for various sides in the league.”
Sherpa also remembered the efforts of prominent tourism entrepreneur Ang Tshering Sherpa — who died in a chopper accident along with the then minister Rabindra Adhikari earlier this year — in building the club. “He had a dream of taking the club to a new height but unfortunately we lost him. I am grateful to his son, Norbu, who took the initiative and decided to support the club in his bid to continue his father’s dreams,” said Sherpa, who is also the president of All Nepal Football Association.

Senior Manager of Yeti Airlines Bhim Raj Rai said the company was sponsoring the club under its Corporate Social Responsibility.
“We have been doing a lot of contribution to the society through the CSR initiative and we joined hands with HSC to help Nepali sports,” Rai said. “Our Managing Director Ang Tshering Sherpa wanted to make a difference in society apart from doing business.
We had supported the club in previous years and his family decided to continue the agreement to keep his dreams alive.”
HSC, who finished seventh in the previous edition, will open the campaign with a match against Nepal Police Club on Tuesday.
Coach Sanjeev Budhathoki was confident of faring well in the league. “We are not in the race to win the league and we will try to give our best to fulfil the club’s target of finishing fourth,” said Budhathoki.

“The place is really amazing, beautiful and pristine. With better promotion, this place can be developed into a major touristic destination of eastern Nepal as it has lots of potentials,” Giriraj Gyawali, a traveller from Gulmi district, who made a maiden trip to Timbung Lake, shared.
“In comparison to earlier days, we receive at least 500 tourists during trekking season in recent days,” Bhim Bhandari, one of the homestay operator, said.
It takes a one-day bus ride and another one day trek to reach Timbung Lake, from Phidim, district headquarters, Dibli Oli, local guide, informed.

369,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/making-the-climb-to-the-summit-of-majestic-mt-fuji/,"SHIZUOKA, JAPAN: People come from all over Japan to climb to the summit of Mount Fuji to see the sunrise.
Buses from Tokyo’s Shinjuku district conveniently drop climbers off at a station located at the 2,300-metre (7,546 feet) point of the majestic mountain, the country’s tallest at 3,776 metres (12,388 feet). It’s not cheating. This is where most people start the long — and crowded — trek.





The Yoshida trail is the easiest and most popular among the routes to the top, with climbers wearing headlamps and carrying heavy packs spaced just feet apart on the rugged, rocky terrain. It takes an average hiker five to six hours to reach the summit. Most spend the night in simple mountain huts and start the final ascent in darkness. Crammed together in the sparse accommodations is part of the communal climbing experience.
Witnessing the sunrise from the summit of the nation’s symbolic mountain is hard to top. Watching it paint the sky deep orange is magnificent.
Climbing season runs from early July to early September, Mount Fuji will open to the public a couple of weeks before the Tokyo Summer Olympics opening ceremony on July 24.
After the descent, visit picturesque Lake Kawaguchi to photograph Mount Fuji from afar.

BANGKOK: Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, edged out Paris and London as the world’s most popular city to visit, according to a survey released on Wednesday, welcome news for Thailand after worries over a drop in foreign arrivals.
Bangkok was named the most-visited city for the fourth consecutive year, with about 22.8 million visitors reported in the annual rankings by MasterCard Inc.
Paris and London were ranked second and third, each with about 19.1 million arrivals, trailed by Dubai with 15.9 million.
Other Southeast Asian cities, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were fourth and fifth in the rankings, based on third-party research, proprietary analysis and public data across 200 destination cities.
New York, Istanbul, Tokyo and Antalya, Turkey, rounded out the top 10.
The number of international visitors across the 200 cities grew by 76% in the last 10 years.
Despite Bangkok’s longtime reign atop the list, the Thai tourism industry has faced headwinds, with arrivals dropping 1.03% year-on-year in May before recovering to grow 0.89% in June from a year earlier.
Tourism accounts for about 12% of Thailand’s economy.
However, weaker Chinese economic growth and a boat accident last year led to a drop off in Chinese arrivals in Thailand in the first half of this year.
The downturn in the number of visitors from China was partially offset by Indian arrivals.
Thailand expects to welcome 2 million Indian tourists in 2019, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, told Reuters, adding this was one year earlier than its target.
In August, the government extended a waiver of a 2,000 baht ($65) fee for visa-on-arrivals for tourists from 18 countries including those from China and India.
A growing middle class and increasing wealth in populations and the rise of low-cost airlines will make travel more accessible, Minor Hotels Chief Executive, Dilip Rajakrier, said in an email.
“Given only less than 10% of the China’s total population having passports today. The potential of the Chinese market will never fade,” he said.

371,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/thailand-extends-visa-fee-waivers-to-boost-tourism-as-growth-slows/,"BANGKOK: Thailand will extend until April next year a measure that waives fees for visas on arrival issued to tourists from 18 countries, as it looks to stimulate growth in tourism to spur a slowing economy, the prime minister said on Tuesday.
The waivers are part of a $10-billion stimulus package to boost growth, including a debt moratorium for farmers, loans for smaller businesses, and more money for low-income earners.
“The cabinet approved the extension of fee waivers until April 2020,” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters, adding that the scheme would cover Lunar New Year and the Thai new year, Songkran.
Foreign tourist receipts make up about 12% of Southeast Asia’s second largest economy, but arrivals increased just 0.89% in June, with visitors from China, the biggest source, declining 7.1% from a year earlier.
The fee of 2,000 baht ($65) is to be waived unil next year for travellers from 18 countries, including China and India.
But the cabinet rejected a proposal for visa-free entry for visitors from China and India, because of security concerns, government spokesman Narumon Pinyosinwat said.

372,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/not-just-bali-indonesia-hopes-to-develop-more-tourism-sites/,"YOGYAKARTA: Hundreds of tourists, many of them young Westerners, sat on grey stone steps atop the world’s largest Buddhist temple, occasionally checking cellphones or whispering to each other as they waited for daylight.
Sunrise wasn’t spectacular on that recent summer day. But even ordinary dawn at Borobudur Temple — nine stone tiers stacked like a wedding cake and adorned with hundreds of Buddha statues and relief panels — provided a memorable experience.

The 9th-century temple is in the centre of Indonesia’s Java island, a densely populated region with stunning vistas. Other highlights include the towering Hindu temple complex of Prambanan, like Borobudur a UNESCO World Heritage site, and Mount Merapi, the country’s most active volcano, whose lava-covered slopes are accessible by jeep.
While the two temples draw many visitors, other foreigners head to the relaxing beaches of Bali, just east of Java and by far the most popular tourist destination in a nation of thousands of islands and almost 270 million people. More than 6 million tourists visited Bali last year, or about 40 per cent of 15.8 million visitors to Indonesia overall, according to official figures.
Recently reelected President Joko Widodo wants to change this dynamic by pushing ahead with “10 new Balis,” an ambitious plan to boost tourism and diversify Southeast Asia’s largest economy.
Key to the plan is to upgrade provincial airports and improve access to outlying destinations, such as Lake Toba on Sumatra island, more than 1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from Jakarta, the capital. Yogyakarta, the provincial city from where visitors head to Borobudur and Prambanan, is getting a second airport, expected to be fully operational later this year.
Widodo has been promoting his plan in meetings with foreign leaders and in recent interviews, including with The Associated Press, in hopes of encouraging foreign investment. The president of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation told the AP in late July that as part of his push, he would like to see more business ties with the Middle East.
“For investment and tourism, we would like to invite investors from the Middle East as much as possible because … we have many tourism locations in Indonesia, not only one or two or four, but many,” said Widodo. He did not give specifics.
Muslim tourists, including from the Middle East, might also be an easier fit for some of the more conservative areas earmarked for tourism development. Tourism officials have played down the possibility of cultural friction that might accompany the influx of more non-Muslim visitors, arguing that Indonesia’s brand of tolerant Islam can accommodate everyone.
“Maybe there are some particular locations that are very strict (religiously),” said Hiramsyah Thaib, who heads the “10 New Balis” initiative. “We believe we won’t have any problems. Sometimes we have problems in the media, but not in reality.”
Yet Islamic hard-liners have become more assertive in recent years, potentially spooking investors by undermining Indonesia’s image as a moderate nation. Thaib said he believes investor confidence rose “significantly” after Widodo defeated former special forces general Prabowo Subianto in April’s presidential election. Subianto had been backed by Muslim groups favouring Shariah law.
The tourism plan remains key to Widodo’s final five-year term, though at least one target — 20 million visitors this year — appears to have been too ambitious. The 2019 visitor tally is expected to be 18 million, based on current growth figures, said Thaib.
Still, the Indonesian tourism sector grew by 7.8 per cent in 2018, or twice the global average, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
One of the 10 sites earmarked for development is the Borobudur Temple area and nearby Yogyakarta, a city of several hundred thousand people that are embedded in a large metro area. The city is a centre of Javanese culture and a seat of royal dynasties going back centuries.
In 2017, former President Barack Obama and his family visited the city, where his late mother, Ann Dunham, spent years doing anthropological research. Obama, who lived in Indonesia as a child, toured Borobudur and Prambanan during the nostalgic trip.
But while the Obamas got around with relative ease, including private jet travel, ordinary visitors struggle with congested streets packed with motorbikes weaving in and out of slow-moving traffic.
Travellers hoping to be in place at Borobudur just before sunrise need at least 90 minutes to get there from Yogyakarta, a journey of 40 kilometres (24 miles). A 230-kilometre (140-mile) round trip to the Dieng highlands, with terraced fields, small temples and a colourful volcanic lake, requires a full day of travel, some of it on bumpy back roads.
Anton McLaughlin, a 55-year-old visitor from York, England, said he was astounded by the number of motorbikes in the streets. Speaking during a jeep tour of the slopes of Mount Merapi, he said he’s become more aware of the natural disasters Indonesians endure regularly. Indonesia straddles the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Merapi’s last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people, and the ruins of one destroyed hamlet were part of the tour.
“People just seem to crack on with life,” McLaughlin said.
Just a day after his tour, the volcano shot out hot clouds and lava that flowed 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) down its slopes. No casualties or damage were reported.
Jan Tenbrinke, 37, from Zwolle in the Netherlands, said Bali is the next stop for his family of four, but that he hoped to get a better sense of Indonesian culture in Yogyakarta.
In the city, tourists can visit workshops for Batik textiles, silver jewellery and Kopi Luwak — coffee made from partially digested coffee cherries that were eaten and defecated by wild tree cats, or civets. Billed as the “world’s most expensive coffee,” Kopi Luwak became known to a wider audience in the 2007 Jack Nicholson-Morgan Freeman movie “The Bucket List.”
Local museums, including two royal palaces and a former Dutch fort, pose a challenge for foreign visitors eager to learn more about local history and culture because they mostly lack easily accessible explanations in English.
Thaib, the tourism official, acknowledged that there is room for improvement. He said Indonesia is determined to catch up to other Asian nations, including Thailand, which he said began developing their tourism industries much sooner.
“There is still a lot of work,” he said of his nation’s efforts. “We believe we are on the right track.”

HIKKADUWA: Sipping fresh coconut water while sunbathing on deserted Hikkaduwa beach, Alexi Konchayenko, a sports trainer from Ukraine, struck a stoical note.
Bomb blasts can happen “anywhere, anytime,” he said, adding that he was not afraid. “Sri Lanka is an amazing country. This is my first visit and I will tell my friends also to come.”
His is a lone voice — and a lone presence. Sri Lanka was the Lonely Planet guide’s top travel destination for 2019, but since the Easter Sunday attacks on churches and luxury hotels, foreign tourists have fled.
Many of those booked to come in the next few months have cancelled. Hotel occupancy across the island has plummeted by 85% to 90%. The tropical beaches, restaurants and shops are empty.
The coordinated suicide bombings on April 21 not only destroyed lives but also wiped out the livelihoods of Sri Lankans who depend on tourism.
More than 250 people, including 45 foreigners mainly from China, India, the US and the UK, died in the Islamic State group-claimed blasts.
Tourists normally come to Hikkaduwa, in the southwest, for the strong waves that are perfect for surfing and sparkling clear waters made for snorkelling. Today, of the 27 hotels, very few are open. Most, along with the eateries that line the 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of palm-fringed beach, are closed.
Among the few hotels still open is Hikkaduwa Beach Hotel. On April 21, all 50 rooms were occupied; today, only a handful. “It’s a real disaster. We don’t know what to do right now,” said Sanjeewani Yogarajah, an executive with the hotel. She said the attack has cost the hotel 5.5 million Sri Lankan rupees ($31,000), forcing the hotel’s management to send half the staff home.
Some tourism officials say the damage to the industry after the bombings is worse than during the 26-year civil war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the government which ended a decade ago. At least then, the violence was mostly contained to the north of Sri Lanka, they said. This time, no part of the island has remained untouched by the blasts.
Lankesha Ponnamperuma, general manager of hotel chain Hikka Tranz, is one of the luckier ones. While most hotels report wholesale cancellations, he is surviving thanks to business from local residents. Last Friday, two-thirds of the 150 rooms were booked, mostly by domestic tourists.
“I haven’t sacked anyone yet. Instead, we are training our people to adjust their expenditure and helping them restructure their bank loans,” Ponnamperuma said.
The president of Sri Lanka’s Hotels Association, Sanath Ukwatta, said hotels have offered 30-50% discounts to entice local residents.
Such a strategy won’t solve the problem, he said, but will “help at least to keep the hotels going.”
The manager of a clothing shop said the owner had shut the group’s other two shops and the factory too. “Business collapsed after April 21,” said Kumari, who declined to give her surname.
According to government figures, there has been an 80% drop in arrivals since the attack. Tourism accounts for 4.9% of Sri Lanka’s GDP. Last year, 2.3 million tourists visited the island, generating $4.4 billion in revenues, a nearly 12% jump from 2017. Around half a million Sri Lankans directly depend on tourism while 2 million depend on it indirectly.
One of them is Mohomed Musflick, the owner of a souvenir shop in Galle which is full of wood carvings, local paintings and postcards. “I have not sold one item. There are no tourists and we are in a huge crisis,” he said.
While life is gradually returning to normal on the island with offices and schools re-opening, the tourism industry is in a sombre mood over the slump in foreign tourists. Tour operators from Russia, Norway and Britain have cancelled bookings going right up to April 2020.
A travel ban issued by nearly a dozen countries is the greatest cause for concern. “The ban is our main worry. Until it is removed or softened, we can’t start our marketing to attract tourists. If it is lifted soon, we are hopeful we can bounce back this year or otherwise definitely next year for sure,” said Yogarajah.
In the meantime, Sri Lanka’s government should target “people and countries resilient to this kind of attacks and situations, such as Russia, Israel and India,” said Anusha Frydman, managing director of the Lavanga Resort and Spa.
The industry is clear about what else it wants from the authorities: Ensure that stringent security measures are in place to reassure potential visitors; persuade politicians to put their differences aside and adopt a bipartisan approach on national security; and work fast to get the travel ban lifted.
To help the industry cope, the government has put together a relief package comprising easy loans at special rates and reduced taxes. The government also plans to formulate a $100 million insurance fund for compensation to any tourist injured or killed while visiting the island.
“In the past we have had many serious crises and we have recovered. I am quite positive we can do it again,” said Jan van Twest, general manager of the Fortress Resort and Spa near Galle, where 750 room nights have been cancelled from May to October.
“But we need to recover, recover very fast,” he said.

Whenever I told someone I was planning to climb to Mount Everest Base Camp this spring, I received the same shocked and wide-eyed response: “Be careful!” While that’s good advice for any adventure, it was difficult to convince friends and family that this trip would not at all be the same thing as actually climbing Mount Everest.
Instead, the Everest Base Camp Trek provides an opportunity for regular hikers like me to tackle a feasible portion of one of the most iconic climbs in the world.
Base Camp is located at 17,600 feet, well below the peak of Everest, which is 29,000 feet. Base Camp is where those planning to summit spend weeks acclimatising and preparing for their journey. It is also the furthest you can go using only your legs before other equipment like ropes and ice picks get involved.
Our eight-day journey to Base Camp began at 9,300 feet, in the small Nepalese mountain town of Lukla. There are no roads to Lukla. It is accessible only by a 30-minute plane ride from Kathmandu. When we landed, I was shocked to find the area crowded and bustling, filled with locals selling trinkets and outdoor gear, and what felt like hundreds of trekkers preparing for their climbs.
From Lukla, we wound our way up muddy paths and across dangling suspension bridges, stepping aside for herds of yak and dzo (yak/cattle hybrids) as we walked further and further into the most remote area in which I have ever hiked.
Yet, it didn’t feel that way. Small towns continued to greet us all the way up. There were lodges to stay in. There were restaurants and bars. I have photos at the world’s highest Irish pub and the world’s highest bakery. In one of the larger towns, Namche Bazaar, at about 11,200 feet, there was even a North Face store. In these towns, dozens of miles from the nearest road, all food and supplies are brought in by helicopter, porter or animal.
In addition to breathtaking, 360-degree views of the Himalayas, elaborate Buddhist monuments lie along the entire route. Every day along the trail we saw massive, intricately painted boulders and colourful stupas (structures meant to bring good karma) wrapped in multicoloured prayer flags. At one point, we even toured a large, fully functioning monastery.
The terrain itself is not as difficult as you’d expect. Anyone in good physical shape could do it, and I have done many other hikes that I found more challenging. We still climbed several thousand feet per day, but the inclines were relatively gradual. This trek, instead, should be known for its panoramic views and the unique experience of hiking through these remote mountain towns.
Of course, the trip is not without risks, but they lie in unexpected places. The flights to and from Lukla are the most dangerous part of the journey. The Lukla airport has long been considered one of the most dangerous airports in the world — and in fact, a fatal crash occurred while we were there. I tried to push the knowledge of the airport’s dangers to the furthest recesses of my mind as I boarded a tiny propeller plane bound for that very place.
The plane ride is beautiful, with mountains on all sides, but the landing is enough to put even the fiercest adventurer on edge. A standard runway is between 6,000-8,000 feet long; Lukla’s is only 1,700 feet long. It’s sloped upward to help slow the plane before it hits the solid rock wall waiting at the end of it. At the other end is a 2,000-foot drop. After landing safely, we were mesmerised watching the planes taking off for Kathmandu literally fly off the edge of a cliff.
Altitude sickness is also a concern, though if you work with an experienced guiding company as we did, they will ensure you climb up slowly to acclimatise. We had two layover days and hiked a far shorter distance each day than our bodies were capable of going. This itinerary helped us grow accustomed to the air as it grew thinner.
Hiking up slowly didn’t feel like a burden, though, as it allowed extra time to take in those jaw-dropping views. The higher I climbed, the more I felt like I could reach out and touch the shimmering, snow-capped peaks. The further we progressed, the more the mountains seemed to bend toward us like we were inside of a snow globe.
At several points, we caught sight of Everest’s majestic peak peering out from behind its neighbours. Most of Everest lies in Tibet, but the peak is in Nepal. As such, the trek to Base Camp does not actually take place on Mount Everest, but inside Sagarmatha National Park — Sagarmatha being the Nepalese name for Everest.
Each day, as we made it a little higher, the air became a little thinner and our breath a little shorter. By day eight, the time between each step I took had grown significantly. I was breathing hard. My feet were dragging and my head pounding. I trudged slowly upward, but upward nonetheless, knowing the goal was within reach.
By mid-afternoon, we hiked across the final ridge and Base Camp came into view. We had made it to the gateway to the top of the world.
Base Camp rests on a massive glacier. I high-fived my group and took in the sight of dozens of yellow tents pitched across the ice, tents belonging to those preparing for their ascent. According to my trekking guide, the glacial terrain changes so rapidly that the expeditioners have to move their tents every two weeks.
We took pictures beside the sign declaring we were there and feasted on dark chocolate almond bark to celebrate. As the afternoon clouds rolled in, we lay back and watched the mountains disappear above our heads. The cheers and squeals of more trekkers arriving filled the air as it began to snow.
It may not have been the top, but it was nonetheless a spot where most people on the planet will never set foot. I feel so lucky to have stood in that very special place, and, as I always do at the end of a hike, I feel so strong knowing it was my own two feet that got me there.

Photo: AP
AMSTERDAM: The city of Amsterdam’s latest attempt to rein in the nuisance of over-tourism by banning guided tours of the red light district has run into opposition from some of the people it is intended to protect: sex workers.
The Dutch capital plans to ban such tours, saying they are disrespectful and contribute to congestion in the narrow, canal-side streets where scantily-clad sex workers sit behind windows to attract customers.
The first step in the new policy was taken Monday night in the red light district, with tours banned from 7 p.m.
On a recent Friday night, the problem was clear to see: Tourists bathed in a red glow emanating from the windows and peep shows’ neon lights were packed shoulder to shoulder as they shuffled through the alleys.
But sex workers’ union Proud questions whether banning tours will reduce tourist numbers and argues that guides educate visitors and encourage them to behave more respectfully toward the women.
“It could also be that now there are no guides that people just wander into the area themselves and gawk at the women behind the window and take photos because there is no one anymore to inform them how to behave or what the rules of the game are in this area,” said a sex worker who goes by the name of Velvet and is the advocacy coordinator for Proud. Velvet declined to give her real name, saying that because of the stigma attached to sex work, most sex workers use a working name or pseudonym to protect their privacy and safety.
Amsterdam’s Prostitution Information Center, which is housed in the same building as Proud, offers its own red light district tours.
The total ban on guided tours, which is planned to come into full force on Jan. 1, is another step in the city’s campaign to reduce the problems associated with over-tourism and part of a broader package of measures reining in tours in the city.
Bobien van Aalst of the Dutch tour guide association Guidor slammed the ban on tours, not just to the red light district but to other historic parts of the city. She said it means guides won’t be able to explain to tourists where Rembrandt van Rijn painted one of his first famous works or where the painter’s wife is buried.
“I mean it’s like in Paris if you’re forbidding (tours) to go to the Arc de Triomphe or the Eiffel Tower,” she said.
City Hall says that more than 1,000 tour groups per week now operate around the Old Church Square in the heart of the red light district.
“Yeah, there’s really over-tourism there — too crowded. I mean there were evenings where … residents basically couldn’t leave their homes anymore because the alleys were blocked,” the city’s deputy mayor, Udo Kock, told The Associated Press.
People who work in Amsterdam’s sex industry question whether there are more tourists, or whether similar numbers are squeezing into a red light district that has shrunk in recent years as hundreds of the sex workers’ windows have been shuttered in an attempt to diversify the narrow streets.
Kock acknowledges that not everybody is happy, but says many others are pleased that the city is tackling the tours.
The red light district is a tourist magnet, especially after dark, with crowds of people waiting to get into sex shows and visiting the Red Light Secrets Museum of Prostitution, where you can experience the windows from a sex worker’s perspective by sitting on a stool in front of a “window” onto which images are projected of men walking past and peering in.
The museum’s manager, Natascha Flipsen, agrees that guided tours help educate the visitors not just about the history of the centuries-old red light district, but also about how to treat the women who work there with respect.
And she says that tourism is good for the business.
For tourists, “this is like the once in a lifetime experience, so they visit the sex work as well of course,” Flipsen said.

When I left my house and reached the airport, it didn’t feel like I was actually going to Bali, but when I sat on the plane, I realised that my journey had begun. The flight, which was pretty chilled with a couple of beers, was of around four hours to Singapore, our transit point.
Then through tough Singapore security, helped by Starbucks coffee and a coconut drink, we were finally on our way to Bali.
So Bali. What can I say? The first thing that crossed my mind is ‘hot and sweaty’. As we got the hang of the weather, we found our guide, and an hour’s drive to the villa.





The sight along the way was awesome — statues of Hindu deities were around every street and corner. And you could see beautiful hand-carved statues of Ganesha and other deities in the shops, a breathtaking scene, their faith in religion, how they worship the gods.
I later found out that they are so religious that all of Bali was closed for two days for New Year’s prayers a day before we arrived. They meditate and pray at temples and their homes.
The villa was like a dream house with a swimming pool. The first thing I did was leave my baggage and go to a local pub for some chilled beers. The most popular and loved beer was Bintang, which cost 25,000 rupiah a bottle — shocking at first, but I later realised it’s around Rs 200.
People from all over the world, especially Australians come here to surf.
The weather is humid, so you sweat like crazy. It is constant summer with no winter, and even the metrology can’t predict rainfall. So it’s mandatory to spend your day in the pool with yes, chilled beer.
The local food was amazing, and hospitality commendable. The beautiful sunset by the ocean added to our first few days making everything surreal.
We also went for Luwak coffee tasting where they give you different drinks of flavoured tea and coffee, which was all free until you wished to drink the world’s most expensive coffee — Luwak animal poop coffee. The process to extract the poop was amazing using traditional hand method of collection to packing. A small cup cost us around 350,000 million Indonesian rupiah, and to buy a small pack I spent nearly 750,000 million rupiah, a gift for my dad that equals around $80. Crazy right? And it was really strong too.
The monkey temple was cool, more like a jungle with amazing sculptures of deities and filled with monkeys, better looking than the ones from Nepal. More mature looking I must say.
Then we visited the Saroswati Temple famous for its lotus blooms. Most people come for wedding photo shoots.
I also pampered myself to a fish spa for my feet. So ticklish!
Then the big day arrived — everything had to be Nepali style, the groom in a car to the wedding temple to the attire to the wedding dance janti. People were amazed, a few even made attempts to film the wedding.
About 50 guests attended the wedding.
The temple where the wedding was held was a massive one dedicated to Lord Shiva. The rituals were in Sanskrit language and I couldn’t understand any of it! The ritual was short as compared to Nepal, the ceremony concluded in just around two hours.
My brother had hired an amazing wedding planner. The ceremony was for two days — mehendi night at our new villa by the beach with black sand, a Jacuzzi and a swimming pool and breathtaking view of the surfers. The whole night was a blast with no sleep where my phone dived into the pool and died. Sad story but …
The next day was the wedding — early morning ceremony by the ocean and janti in 1940s classic vehicle headed towards the temple where the ceremony took place. The reception took place in the evening where a Balinese fire dancer showcased all kinds of acts and fire tricks. The decoration was beautiful with all the lights reflected by the pool of our villa.
We had heard of the popular Bali swing, so the last day we spent seeing that and other sites and shopping places.
Though we had a few mishaps  — a few had their luggage arriving a day late, one bashed his head swimming at 3:00 am, one broke his leg, my aunt lost $1,200, and I dropped my phone in the pool, it was one heck of a week.
As I write this story, I still feel the wind, the ocean, my family’s laughter and the closeness we felt coming together from different parts of the world for a week, leaving our hectic lives behind to enjoy and be together in a beautiful new place and for such an auspicious occasion. It was an experience of a life time.

CYRENE, LIBYA: Graffiti covers the walls of a Greek amphitheatre in Cyrene, an ancient ruined city in eastern Libya now struggling with neglect, vandals and illegal confiscation of land by locals.
The deserted souvenir shops and cafes on the mountainous road leading to the 2,600-year-old site are the only reminders that this used to be a major tourist destination.
Looting has hit Libya’s archaeological sites since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 when the country descended into turmoil with rival administrations competing for control.
Cyrene is one of five of UNESCO’s World Heritage sites in the North African country listed for their outstanding value. Others include the ruins of the Roman city of Leptis Magna, and Sabratha, both in western Libya.
Apart from Cyrene, some 200 km (124 miles) east of Benghazi, the east of the country has the Apollonia site just 20 km away.
With tourists gone and the antiquities department complaining about budget shortages, vandals have smeared graffiti on columns and looted artefacts.
Some treasures such as heads or entire torsos of statues listed in guidebooks issued in 2011 are no longer there.
“Many artefacts have been smuggled abroad,” said Ahmad Hussein, the head of the antiquities department of a parallel administration in charge of eastern Libya.
Unable to prevent theft, his department has been registering artefacts, a process which has helped to recover some in Europe, he said.
There was better site protection before 2011, but excavation at the site, in fact, dates back to Italian rule — the colonialists’ equipment can still be seen. The last Italians left the east in 1943 following their military defeat when the region came under British administration.
“There has been a lot of destruction in recent years,” said Ismail Miftah, a farmer living next to Cyrene. “Ordinary people don’t appreciate the ancient heritage.”

KATHMANDU: Four Sherpa climbers who got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Mt Makaulu Base Camp in two-metre deep snow in Sankhuwasabha for over a week shared that the high route of the Great Himalaya Trail witnessed an unusual snowfall in this winter season.
Four climbers – Pemba Jangbu Sherps, Darinji Sherpa, Pemba Rinji Sherpa and Pasang Gelu Sherpa were rescued by a Kailash Air helicopter on Monday as they ran out of food in the mountain area while embarking on a trek namely “German Nepal Friendship: The Great Himalaya Trail in Winter”.
It was really an unusual snowfall in the region, one of the team leaders Pemba Jangbu shared.
“We had to to turn around due to heavy snow in the Barun-Valley in Sankhuwasabha this season,” he said, recounting that as this is was a friendship project between Nepal and Germany the crew continued to Barun Dobhan trying to reach the high passes – Sherpani Col 6,110m, West Col 6,100m and Amphu Labtsa 5,700m – to cross into Khumbu.
“This is not only the story of the first ever attempt of the GHT High Route in winter but a story about German-Nepali friendship,” German Geographer Hannes Kuenkel, who is also a leader of the team, added.
This year the crew regrouped and was joined by seven experienced Sherpa – Darinji, Pemba Rinji, Pasang Gelu, Dafuri, Pasang Dawa, Phurba Sonam, Pasang Tendi – from Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Municipality-1, Solokhumbu, German photographer Martin Poetter and Austrian videographer Julia Brunner.
As they started their trek from Olongchun Gola where they had to break up last time and then crossed the snowy Lumbha Samba Pass (5,175m), the team reached Arun Valley on January 11.
“As all routes up to Makulu Base Camp were very difficult we tried the High Route above Hongon up to Malun Pokhari at 4,000m and we had experienced heavy snowfall and up to two feet high snow which made it impossible to hike with heavy loads,”  Kuenkel said.
As the weather was very unpredictable and the route not marked or built the team decided to take their only chance for the High Route by splitting the group in Gadhi on January 19 and sending the four strongest Sherpas led by Pemba Jangbu with only minimum equipment and light packs via Keke La pass (4,100m) towards the high passes while the others returned to Tumlingtar and flew via Kathmandu to Namche to meet up with the crew again, according to him.
The plan was that the Germans met the Sherpa again in Khumbu and together finished the Eastern part of the GHT via the icy Trashi Labtsa Pass (5,777m).
“Unfortunately the weather became worse and the Sherpa team got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Makaulu Base Camp in up to two-metre deep snow and the crew experienced 120 hours of continuous snowfall between January 22 (1pm) and January 28 (1am).”
On January 24, the snowfall stopped for 13 hours but the helicopter could not start from Kathmandu due to bad weather there. Pemba Jangbu who led over 26 expeditions told that he never experienced this kind of snowfall before. “On 28th January, a helicopter rescue was successful. It was just in time as the crew run out of gas and food.”
This winter the extraordinarily heavy snowfall did not allow the team to continue. So the team returned to Kathmandu were they stay together as friends and already prepare plans for a next attempt, according to Kuenkel, who visited Nepal for 15 times.
The two expedition leaders Pemba Jangbu and Kuenkel mentioned that they continued this project for three reasons: to promote trekking in Nepal, make people sensitive for the consequences of global warming and demonstrating how strong and powerful the international friendship can be.
According to team members, Pemba Jangbu, also owner of IAM Trekking & Expeditions and the German Geographer Hannes met during an Everest North Side Expedition which was shattered by the big earthquake in 2015.
In January 2017 they started the first attempt of the GHT High Route in winter. As the eastern part of Nepal has the highest mountains and passes they decided to take that challenge first and go from East to West starting in Taplejung.
They went up to Pangpema BC of Kantschendzonga, crossing the Nango La (4700m) to Olangchung Gola. That year the German became heavily sick in Olangchung Gola and had to give up early.

BANGKOK: Thailand approved marijuana for medical use and research on Tuesday, the first legalisation of the drug in a region with some of the world’s strictest drug laws.
The junta-appointed parliament in Thailand, a country which until the 1930s had a tradition of using marijuana to relieve pain and fatigue, voted to amend the Narcotic Act of 1979 in an extra parliamentary session handling a rush of bills before the New Year’s holidays.
“This is a New Year’s gift from the National Legislative Assembly to the government and the Thai people,” said Somchai Sawangkarn, chairman of the drafting committee, in a televised parliamentary session.
While countries from Colombia to Canada have legalised marijuana for medical or even recreational use, the drug remains illegal and taboo across much of Southeast Asia, which has some of the world’s harshest punishments for drug law violations.
Marijuana traffickers can be subject to the death penalty in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.
But in Thailand, the main controversy with legalisation involved patent requests by foreign firms that could allow them to dominate the market, making it harder for Thai patients to access medicines and for Thai researchers to access marijuana extracts.
“We’re going to demand that the government revoke all these requests before the law takes effect,” said Panthep Puapongpan, Dean of the Rangsit Institute of Integrative Medicine and Anti-Aging.
Some Thai advocates hope that Tuesday’s approval will pave the way for legalisation for recreational use.
“This is the first baby step forward,” said Chokwan Chopaka, an activist with Highland Network, a cannabis legalisation advocacy group in Thailand.

BERLIN: More than 6 million visitors, 7.5 million liters of beer, 124 rotisserie oxen and Bill Clinton in lederhosen; another Oktoberfest in Munich has come and gone.
Festival organizers say good fall weather helped attract 100,000 more people to the annual event than last year; in all, 6.3 million from about 70 countries. That’s despite this year’s Oktoberfest running only 16 days — two fewer than in 2017.
Former US President Clinton and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showed up Friday night — he dressed in traditional Bavarian garb and she in a trademark pantsuit.
Security guards confiscated 101,000 liter-size beer mugs from sticky-fingered guests seeking souvenirs. Munich authorities cleaned up 95 tons of garbage during the festival that ended Sunday.

MEDORA: For travelers looking to visit all 50 states, North Dakota is often one of the last to be checked off. It’s not exactly on the way to anywhere else, and flying there is expensive.
It ended up being 49th on my 50-state quest (sorry, Idaho!). Part of the challenge was deciding what to do there and how to get there. I had to choose between visiting Fargo in eastern North Dakota (and the name of one of my favorite movies) or Theodore Roosevelt National Park in the west.
It’s 330 miles (530 kilometers) between them, and I didn’t have time for both on a week-long road trip that also included Montana’s Glacier National Park and Idaho’s Craters of the Moon.
In the end, Roosevelt Park won out. Photos of its badlands and prairies enchanted me, and the story of Teddy Roosevelt’s sojourn there following the deaths of his wife and mother on the same day intrigued me.
What was it about this place that allowed this future president to grieve and recover — while at the same time inspiring him to become one of America’s most influential conservationists? I needed to see it for myself.
GETTING THERE
My husband and I flew to Denver — by air from New York, the cheapest jumping-off point — and rented a car (unlimited mileage, of course). We then drove 600 miles (965 kilometers) north through Wyoming and South Dakota to the tiny North Dakota town of Medora (population 132), at the entrance to the park’s South Unit.
Fortunately, those 600 miles were easily done in a day, thanks to speed limits of 75 and 80 mph (120-128 kph) in many spots, and little traffic outside Colorado. Still, it felt like we were heading to a pretty remote place, and I wondered if the park would hold its own against national parks I’d visited in Alaska, Hawaii and the Southwest, not to mention Yellowstone and Yosemite.
About 700,000 people visit Roosevelt Park yearly, compared to the more than 3 million annual visitors at places like Montana’s Glacier Park.
THE LOOP AND WILDLIFE
Teddy Roosevelt Park is open 24 hours daily. We arrived at 7:30 a.m. one day at the tail end of last summer. Map in hand, we drove the 36-mile (58-kilometer) scenic loop around the park’s South Unit, stopping at many of the nearly 20 points of interest along the way.
Within minutes, we came upon a prairie dog town. Dozens of the tiny creatures scampered back and forth, popping in and out of little holes amid scrubby grasses. We’d see three more prairie dog towns before we completed the loop, along with wild horses grazing on a hill by the roadside and in another spot, a herd of bison.
The wildlife encounters were thrilling and unexpected surprises.
THE LANDSCAPE
The landscape was thrilling too. The scent of sage perfumed the air, and bursts of red foliage punctuated the gray-green grasslands. Stripes of peach, cream and mud-brown earth and stone lined the curving banks of the Little Missouri River.
Framing it all were the famous badlands stretching to the horizon: flat-topped stone formations with striated slopes in tawny yellows and russet reds, dotted with bright green trees and patches of grass. They looked like the crusty paws of some massive alien creature on the verge of rising up.
We did most of the hikes along the loop drive, some just a few minutes’ walk to an overlook, others 20 to 40 minutes along hilly trails covering a mile or more. At every stop, we were awed by the scenery, from the astonishing palette of earthy hues to the stone shapes etching land and sky.
ROOSEVELT’S STORY
An exhibit at the visitor center tells Roosevelt’s story. On his first visit in 1883, he hunted bison and invested in a ranch near Medora. He’d been a state assemblyman in his native New York, but after his mother and wife both died on Feb. 14, 1884, he left politics and returned to the badlands to mourn his losses.
He lived in a small ponderosa pine cabin now located just steps from the visitor center. It’s furnished with period pieces and some of his belongings, including his traveling trunk, a replica of his writing desk and a rocking chair.
Roosevelt lived the cowboy life, spending days riding and herding in what was considered America’s last frontier. His experiences there were formative: He lost more than $24,000 when blizzards decimated the cattle he’d invested in. He witnessed the environmental damage done by overgrazing. And he realized that the bison, who once roamed the plains in the millions, had dwindled to the hundreds.
Roosevelt wrote three books inspired by his Western sojourn. He eventually returned to politics, serving as New York governor and from 1901-1909, as US president. His accomplishments included the conservation of 230 million acres of land, a legacy that led to the creation of the National Park Service in 1916.
For me, Roosevelt Park ranks among the most interesting and beautiful I’ve seen. I wish I hadn’t waited so long to visit, and I hope someday to go back and absorb more of the place that Roosevelt called “a land of vast silent spaces — a place of grim beauty.”

DENPASAR, INDONESIA: The Indonesian tourist island of Bali closed its international airport Friday, stranding thousands of travelers, as the Mount Agung volcano gushed a 2,500-meter (8,200-feet) column of ash and smoke.
The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said nearly 450 flights were canceled, affecting some 75,000 people.
The regional Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Darwin, Australia, said winds would carry the ash southwest toward Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island. Volcanic ash is a potentially deadly threat to aircraft that can cause engines to “flame out.”
The volcano began belching ash and smoke on Thursday and several airlines canceled inbound and outbound flights scheduled for the evening.
“We hadn’t a place to stay for the night so we had to find something else, just took a taxi and stayed at a random hostel,” said a stranded German backpacker who identified herself as Louisa. “We hoped that we could leave this morning, but the airport is closed,” she said.
Two small airports, at Banyuwangi and Jember in eastern Java, also closed because of the ash threat.
Agung’s alert level has not been raised and an exclusion zone around the crater remains at 4 kilometers (2.5 miles).
The disaster agency said the closure of Bali’s airport is in effect until 7 p.m. It said the situation will be reviewed at midday.
Australia’s national airline Qantas said in a statement that it’s “currently not safe” to operate Bali flights.
It said it was monitoring advice from the ash advisory center and its own pilots and meteorologists would decide when flights can resume.
The volcano, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) northeast of Bali’s tourist hotspot of Kuta, last had a major eruption in 1963, killing about 1,100 people.
It had a dramatic increase in activity last year, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, but had quietened by early this year. Authorities lowered its alert status from the highest level in February.
Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Government seismologists monitor more than 120 active volcanoes.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: Once a pristine Thai paradise, the secluded bay made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie “The Beach” has been exhausted by mass tourism. Now it’s getting a break.
After Friday, the daily influx of dozens of boats and thousands of visitors unsuccessfully scrambling for an unspoiled view of Maya Bay’s emerald waters and glistening white sand will end. The attraction is being closed for four months to give its coral reefs and sea life a chance to recover.
Thailand has promoted unfettered tourism for decades and the onslaught on Maya Bay, which is on Phi Phi Leh Island in the Andaman Sea, has only picked up pace in recent years. Authorities now say they are striving to balance profit and conservation and the closure will happen every year.
It is part of a rethink happening globally about unrestricted tourism that brings in big dollars but damages historic sites, harms the environment and often alienates locals.
Last month, the Philippines began a six-month closure of popular Boracay Island, whose waters President Rodrigo Duterte described as a “cesspool.” Venice, the famed Italian lagoon city that lives off tourism, installed gates at two access bridges during a four-day holiday in April so it could turn back visitors if numbers became overwhelming.
Many of Thailand’s marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October during the monsoon season but because of Maya Bay’s popularity, it hasn’t had a break since a Hollywood crew set foot on its sands in 1999 to film the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland. Its corals have been decimated by the suffocating clouds of sand and sediment churned up by speedboats.
“I tried to push this campaign for many, many years, but you know in Thailand we are a tourism industry country and we need a lot of money, so before not so many people listened,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine biologist and member of a government committee on development and the environment.
“It should have been done 10 years ago but at least it has been done,” he said.
Thailand had about 35 million international visitors last year, a five-fold increase in little more than two decades.
Shi Pengfei, among the last tourists to visit Maya Bay before its closure, said he had no idea that there would be so many people on the beach.
“I feel that there are so many people here,” said Shi, from Henan, China. “The government’s plan to close off the beach for a few months is only natural because the ocean needs a break, a chance to recover, so that the next generation can have a better and even more beautiful destination.”
But locals aren’t entirely happy. The head of the Phi Phi Tourist Business Association, Watrapol Jantharo, said he was surprised when the closure was announced in March by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
He said locals were under the impression that Maya Bay would only be closed to boats, while visitors would still walk to the bay from the other side of the island.
“We are not against protecting our environment,” he said. “We know full well that Maya Bay is our important resource, like a rice field to a farmer, but we wish there are more communications about the government’s plan before the decision was made.”
Thon, however, said the plan was discussed with locals for three years before a decision was made.
“In the past, we made some mistake because we think that the money is very important. But now we are trying to change our idea,” he said. Overseas visitors are “very important to our country, but the most important thing is our national resource. We have to preserve and hand it to the next generation.”
The government has set a limit of 2,000 tourists a day when the bay reopens — about half the current number. Boats will no longer be allowed to anchor but must dock on the opposite side of the island.
“Now that the government has this plan, we can’t change it. But we could use this opportunity to tell the world that we do not just have Maya Bay. There are 10 other beautiful beaches and islands around here that tourists can enjoy,” said Watrapol.
Thailand’s efforts to protect certain islands after decades of unregulated tourism began about three years ago under the current military junta, which has banned the types of protests such moves may have sparked had they been announced by civilian governments.
Yoong Island, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Tachai Island in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off-limits to tourists since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said he was amazed by the results. Waters that were devoid of fish are now teeming, he said, and there is about 10,000 square meters (107,600 square feet) of newly recovered coral off one of the islands.
At Maya Bay, park rangers have been preparing a coral propagation program, attaching it to rocks that will be placed in the bay once the tourists are gone.
“We’re almost certain that something good will happen in Maya Bay,” Thon said.

BANGKOK: The daily hordes of tourists have exhausted the Thai beach made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie.
Maya Bay, on Phi Phi Leh island in the Andaman Sea, will be closed to all visitors for four months annually starting this June to allow for the recovery of the battered coral reefs and sea life. The decision to keep visitors away was made Wednesday by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
“It’s like someone who has been working for decades and has never stopped,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a prominent marine scientist and member of Thailand’s national strategy committee on environment development. “Overworked and tired, all the beauty of the beach is gone. We need a timeout for the beach.”
Many Thai marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October, but because of tourist demand, Maya Bay has remained open year-round since a Hollywood crew set foot there in 1999 to film “The Beach,” the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland.
The beach receives an average of 200 boats and 4,000 visitors each day. Recent surveys by a team led by marine biologists found a large part of the coral reefs around the area is gone and sea life has virtually disappeared.
Other Southeast Asian beach resorts are under threat too.
In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has vowed to close Boracay, a small central island popular for its powdery white sand beaches and vibrant nightlife, saying it has become a “cesspool.”
“Their waste would go directly to the ocean. The germ content is already very high there,” Duterte said last week. “It only looks good because of the white coastline.”
His top environmental officials say Boracay may be closed in the last week of April after a 30-day notice is issued and the tropical island placed under a state of calamity to allow the government to extend emergency funds to affected villagers and establishments.
During the closure, which could last six months or less, a massive cleanup is planned and noncompliant beach resorts and other establishments would have to install waste treatment and disposal systems to halt further contamination. Boracay drew more than 1 million tourists last year mostly from Asia, the United States and Europe.
Boracay officials may face administrative cases for allowing environmental laws to be breached for years and for failing to regulate the influx of tourists beyond the island’s capacity.
Thon said the Thai beach’s temporary closing will kick-start the rehabilitation process.
“If you ask me if it is too late to save our islands, the answer is no. But if we don’t do something today, it will be too late,” said Thanya Netithammakum, head of the National Parks and Wildlife Department.
When Maya Bay reopens, the department will set a daily limit of 2,000 tourists, while boats will no longer be allowed to anchor there and will have to dock on the opposite side of the island at floating piers.
The number of visitors the beach has been seeing is unsustainable, and a temporary closure is better than nothing, Thon said.
“The locals know that and we all know that,” he said. “This would be a good way to start managing our tourist destinations. And we can improve on what we learn after the first year. We know that it’s important we manage our resources well. It’s not about more numbers of tourists but about sustainable tourism that benefit locals as well.”
More than 35 million tourists visited Thailand last year, compared to around 10 million when “The Beach” premiered in 2000.
Thai authorities have in the past closed off islands ruined by mass tourism. Koh Yoong, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Koh Tachai, in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off limits to tourists permanently since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said the results have been amazing. Areas with a bleak sea life environment and coral bleaching are now teeming with robust and colorful sea life and coral, he said. He’s certain that the annual closure will also help restore Maya Bay.
“I have always dreamt that one day we could work to bring her back to life. I have been following and working on Maya Bay for more than 30 years. I had seen it when it was a heaven and I see it when it has nothing left. Anything that we can do to bring this paradise back to Thailand is the dream of a marine biologist,” he said.

IFEROUANE: Tuaregs in northern Niger are hoping to draw tourists back to the region by putting their traditional dances, music poetry and camel races on display.
Despite concerns about Islamic extremism throughout the Sahel region in West Africa, organizers recently hosted more than 1,000 visitors to a cultural festical in Iferouane, a village in Niger’s far north.
“Without tourism, our youth risks falling into idleness and misery, and will join the wave of migration to Europe,” said Mohamed Houma, the mayor of the town located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the central city of Agadez.
The Air festival, considered one of the most important gatherings to celebrate the culture of the Tuareg people, has been held since 2001.
It was marked last month by the sound of tende, the Tuareg style of music and drumming, as the women and men, on foot and on their camels, participated in song and dance competitions.
Since 2001, the gatherings have been held to celebrate the culture of the semi-nomadic Tuareg people. More than 2 million Tuaregs live in the Sahara Desert area, stretching across Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria and Tunisia.
Niger’s Air region, with oases, mountains and sand dunes, has been a destination for adventurous Western tourists since the 1980s and the visitors have been a financial boon for the region. But the tourism has dwindled since the Tuareg rebellion, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, and from the proliferation of armed and extremist groups in the Sahel region.
Security guards watched over the dozen French and Belgian tourists who participated this year’s in Air Festival.
“We are very happy because this festival shows the rest of the world that despite the international geopolitical and security context, we live here in peace, sheltered from the upheavals of some of our neighboring countries,” Houma said.
French tourists to the festival this year included Jacques Maire, a French legislator who heads a France-Niger Friendship group in the French National Assembly.
While the situation in Niger is tense, he said it is not the worst in the region.
“There has always been a strong French appetite for the Sahara,” said Maire. “We must seize every opportunity to recreate tourist flows.”

PHOENIX: Arizona officials on Friday guaranteed that Grand Canyon National Park will remain in full operation if Congress fails to pass a budget and a government shutdown ensues.
Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said the state’s top tourist attraction “will not close on our watch, period.”
Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak says the state’s parks and tourism agencies plan to provide up to $100,000 to ensure lodging, campgrounds and restaurants remain open, and more funding if needed.
The state agencies have been working with the National Park Service to plan for a possible shutdown as early as Saturday if Congress fails to pass a government funding bill. The House passed a temporary government funding bill Thursday night, but the Senate was deadlocked.
President Donald Trump and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer met Friday afternoon in an eleventh-hour effort to avert a shutdown. The impasse is over federal spending and legislation to protect some 700,000 younger immigrants from deportation.
“If Washington, D.C. won’t function, Arizona will,” Ducey said in a statement. “Don’t change your travel plans, because Arizona is open for business — regardless of what happens back in Congress.”
The U.S. Interior Department said national parks and other public lands will remain as accessible as possible if a shutdown happens. That’s a change from previous shutdowns, when most parks were closed and became high-profile symbols of dysfunction.
But spokeswoman Heather Swift said services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds, full-service restrooms and concessions won’t be operating in most locations.
Arizona’s decision to guarantee funding to cover the cost of those services means they should operate at the Grand Canyon as normal if a shutdown occurs.
Arizona paid about $100,000 a day to cover the full cost of keeping the Grand Canyon open during the last shutdown in 2013 but was eventually reimbursed by the federal government. Former Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, worked to pay the National Park Service $651,000 to keep the popular tourist destination open for a week. That came after a shutdown that lasted more than a week.
Federal lawmakers reached an agreement on the budget before those seven days were up.
During a 1995 shutdown, Arizona’s governor famously led a convoy of unarmed troops to the park’s gate to demand it be opened.
They were met there by the park superintendent, who negotiated with then-Gov. Fife Symington, a Republican, for a partial reopening if the budget impasse continued.
The shutdown was briefly solved, but when the parks were again closed a month later, the state paid more than $17,000 a day to keep the road to the Grand Canyon Village and the Mather Point scenic viewpoint on the canyon’s South Rim open.

LAMJUNG: A number of domestic tourists visiting a historical site of Rainaskot in Lamjung district has increased significantly.
Home stay, started after renovation of an earthquake affected houses are now packed with the domestic tourists. It is being run in a total of 14 houses which are built with the modern techniques where 84 tourists can be accommodated at once.
The concept of home stay in Rainaskot begun with American national Natasha Wajniyak providing a fund of Rs 20.75 million to renovate the quake affected houses according to Sarbodaya Old Age Home’s Chairperson Krishna Raj Oliya.
One of the home stay entrepreneurs in Rainaskot, Dilmaya Gurung informed that the domestic tourists are also provided the opportunities of observing the local cultural programs during their stay.
“Besides, tasting the local organic foods, domestic tourists also can experience the local cultures,” said Gurung. Since the Rainaskot has a big Gurung population, a museum related to that caste also has been established.
Meanwhile Rainaskot Tourism Committee’s Chairperson Khadak Bahadur Gurung expressed his hope of attracting even bigger number of the domestic tourists in the future. Visitors can reach the site after two hours of bus ride and three hours of hike from Paudi, a gateway of Lamjung district.
Mesmerizing views of 18 mountain ranges including Annapurna and Machchapuchhre can be seen from the Rainaskot.

MADRID, SPAIN:  A passenger on a delayed Ryanair flight from London who apparently got fed up waiting to get off a plane after it landed in the southern Spanish city of Malaga surprised fellow passengers by using the emergency exit to jump onto a wing.
The incident on New Year’s Day took place 30 minutes after the flight from Stansted Airport landed.
The man, who has not been named but is said to be a non-Spanish citizen, was coaxed back onto the plane while police were called.
Fellow passenger Fernando del Valle Villalobos, who videoed the incident, said he heard the man say he got fed up waiting.
“I was astonished,” del Valle, 25, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
He said the passengers were standing in the aisle waiting to get off the plane when the man “very calmly asked permission to get past, opened the emergency exit, looked out, saw the wing, went back for his back-pack.”
Later, he said the captain came out and asked the man why he had done it and del Valle heard him say clearly that he was sick of waiting inside. The passengers, except the man in question, were kept a further 15 minutes on the plane before being let off.
Police said Wednesday that they have opened a complaint against the man for breaching security.
Ryanair said the incident was now in the hands of Spanish authorities.

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA: While much of the nation shivers in bone-aching cold, people in Alaska’s largest city are basking in warmer weather, jogging in short sleeves, ice-skating in T-shirts or walking dogs while just lightly bundled up.
Anchorage saw an official high of 44 degrees Tuesday, tying the record set in 1981 and 2011. That was warm enough for Patricia Bierer, who was visiting Alaska this winter from Montana.
“I am from the Bitterroot Valley in Montana, and it’s colder there today than it is here in Alaska,” said Bierer, dressed in a pink parka as she strolled with family members around Anchorage’s Westchester Lagoon. “And my children that are there are jealous because I’ve got 40-degree temperatures here.”
National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Kurtz said areas of high and low pressure are working together to push tropical air to the north. But temperatures are expected to begin dropping Tuesday night, and below freezing by Wednesday. That freeze-thaw vacillation should bring slick conditions to the area.
“I jokingly refer to it as freezy, skid stuff,” Kurtz said.
It comes as the weather service issued wind chill advisories and freeze warnings covering a vast area, from South Texas to Canada and from Montana to Maine.

A large swath of the US is freezing under Alaska-like weather, but parts of the nation’s northernmost state itself are basking in balmy conditions. Tuesday’s official temperature hit a record 45 degrees in Anchorage. (Jan. 2)

The unseasonable temperatures brought Anchorage resident Cassandra Sullivan out to walk her pit bull Athena along downtown streets. She said it helped jolt her out of the winter blues.
“For some reason, with the weather out today as it is and just the breeze and the warm air, it kind of brings me out of it,” she said.
Ashley Durst, walking her dog at the downtown lagoon during her lunch break, admitted that the warmer weather was a little unusual because it can be minus-30 this time of the year.
But she doesn’t mind that others are feeling that bite instead. “I just think maybe it’s time they get their little taste of it for a while,” she said with a smile.

LAS VEGAS: Las Vegas welcomed 2018 with fireworks, big-ticket musical acts and unprecedented security in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in US modern history just three months ago.
Law enforcement officers kept a close eye Monday on the estimated 330,000 people who traveled from all over the US and beyond to pack in the Las Vegas Strip and downtown’s Fremont Street. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had every officer working throughout the weekend and was aided by the Nevada National Guard and federal agents.
Rosy-cheeked visitors took selfies and livestreamed the celebration amid temperatures in the mid-40s (4 Celsius), much warmer than most of the US. They wore glittery hats, tiaras and other 2018-themed paraphernalia as they hugged and cheered on the new year.
“One bad incident is not going to deter us from having a good time,” Honolulu resident Pettra Stark, who planned her trip after the Oct. 1 shooting, said while standing underneath the massive video canopy on Fremont Street.
For Stark, the heavy presence of armed officers was reassuring. But not everyone felt the same way, including Adrian Dominguez, who traveled for the festivities with 10 other relatives.
“It’s not pleasant to see so many officers,” Dominguez, a resident of the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Juarez. “They are everywhere.”
The heightened security comes after a high-stakes gambler killed 58 and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below before killing himself.
On Saturday, two security guards were fatally shot while investigating a disturbance at Arizona Charlie’s Decatur, a hotel-casino just west of the Strip. Police said the suspect was hospitalized with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities described it as an isolated incident and assured that it was not terrorism-related.
A roughly eight-minute fireworks display at the top of seven of the city’s world-famous casino-hotels started at the Stratosphere 10 seconds before midnight Monday and continued to Venetian, Treasure Island, Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Aria and MGM Grand. More than 80,000 pyrotechnic firings that illuminated the sky in gold, red and green.
Megastars performed at venues up and down the Strip. The Foo Fighters played at The Chelsea at The Cosmopolitan, Maroon 5 was at the Mandalay Bay Events Center and Britney Spears performed at The Axis at Planet Hollywood.
At a lower-key celebration in downtown Las Vegas’ casino-flanked Fremont Street Experience, bands played under a massive video canopy while visitors danced and sipped giant beers.
Las Vegas police officer Larry Hadfield on Monday said there were no incidents related to the festivities to speak of. The Nevada Highway Patrol on Twitter reported the arrest of two suspected impaired drivers near the Strip.
Police cruisers, dump trucks and other large vehicles blocked key intersections during the night to try to prevent anyone from plowing into crowds.
Strollers, backpacks, large bags, coolers and glass bottles were banned from the Strip for the night. Ticket holders for the celebration on Freemont Street Experienced went through checkpoints where security guards used hand-held metal detectors.
New Year’s Eve is worth an estimated $254.3 million to Las Vegas, according to the city’s Convention and Visitors Authority. More than 97 percent of the destination’s nearly 149,000 hotel and motel rooms were expected to be booked.

Canada is more than just its great mountains, wild moose-spotting road trips and craggy-coast good looks. Its endless variety of landscapes might keep you busy the first few days but what would a traveller look for beyond the great outdoors? Its captivating culture will engulf you; from west to east, a foodie’s paradise your palates would be thoroughly refreshed and thriving cities with their own artistic flair will surprise you. But if you’re looking to weave stories out of adventures for years to come here are a few places that you must check out.

Venture into the woods

If snuggled in a sphere suspended atop the forest canopy of Vancouver Island in the middle of nowhere is what excites you then a visit to the Free Spirit Spheres is a must. It’s part Middle Earth fantasy and part childhood dream, you’ll find large wooden orbs suspended from the trees. Take the spiral staircase and short suspension bridge leading up to them and enter into the sphere to experience nature from a different perspective.
Designed to look vaguely like enormous nuts or seeds, the cedar and spruce spheres borrow from and collaborate with the surrounding environment. The spheres are made of fibreglass and wood, and borrow heavily from sailboat construction methods. Inside the curving walls complete with portholes for windows, space is maximised with fold-out tables and mirrors, curved loft beds and benches, and tiny appliances. Touted as ‘the ultimate tree-house experience,’ these Free Spirit Spheres can be rented overnight.

Brace yourself

Mazes and labyrinths reached its zenith as a form in Renaissance England, more as a device for
entertainment than serious purpose. Today VanDusen Garden in Vancouver is one of only six in North America.
It carries on the tradition of Elizabethan hedge mazes in North America. The maze is made of 3,000 pyramidal cedars — Thuja occidentalis ‘Fastigiata’ to be specific was planted in the autumn of 1981 and slowly grown into the form of the maze one finds today.
Named after local lumber magnate and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen, this garden is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. In addition to the maze, the gardens cover 55 acres and displays plants from around the world. There is an observation terrace from which the less adventuresome visitor can view the maze and the struggles of its confused occupants.

For your eyes only

A book collector’s dream, The Monkey’s Paw in Toronto has the world’s first ‘Biblio-Mat’, a
random book vending machine.  All of the books lining the shelves of Stephen Fowler’s bookstore are ones you couldn’t possibly find anywhere else. He opened The Monkey’s Paw in March 2006 and since then it has been a haven for antiquarians, complete with
medical drawings on the wall and a stuffed crow on a typewriter.
The unusual store, named after a horror short story by author WW Jacobs, has a diverse range of old books. Fowler selects each book to fit these categories: the beautiful, the arcane, the macabre and the absurd. For some its charm may be the custom-made Biblio-Mat, a vending machine that will dispense a randomly selected vintage volume for $2, a surprise you might want to see for yourself.

Fairytale escape

An old world fairytale-land with over 350 fairy folk figurines hidden amongst 800-year old cedars is something that will surely lure you in. Artist Doris Needham and her husband Ernest needed a place to put her hand-sculpted cement creations, so they bought a forest in British Columbia and filled it with enchanted figures from fairytales and nursery rhymes.
When Rogers Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needhams’ unusual haven; one just cannot drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house.
The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage, or a favourite
nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. Take the Nature Walk, a 2-km walk through the lush Canadian forest, where you’ll discover many trees, including an 800-year-old cedar grove. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest tree house in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old
cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.

Jewel in the crown

As their contribution to Montreal’s 1967 World’s Fair Exposition the United States government
commissioned architect, scientist, and well-known genius Buckminster Fuller to design a pavilion for the Canadian exhibition.
Fuller, who popularised, perfected, and named the Geodesic Dome, designed a 20-storey-tall dome in the fashion of his hallmark design to represent the USA. Done in a full two-thirds sphere, rather than the typical half dome, the massive steel structure was seen and admired by over 5.6 million visitors who went into the dome to see exhibits from actual spaceships from the Apollo missions to American works of art.  The dome’s steel skeleton was fitted with a clear acrylic covering, making the structure look like a massive, glittering jewel.
When the fair ended, the pavilion remained, securing the dome’s place in Montreal’s landscape. This relic of the 67 Expo survived fire and ice; it was reopened and was re-purposed as a museum devoted to environmental action. Today the Biosphere of Montreal remains, a sturdy and beautiful example of ‘Bucky’s’ geodesic architecture.

Work of art

Comprised of 15,000 tonnes of snow and 500,000 tonnes of ice, the Hôtel de Glace is a massive undertaking, a stunning yet ephemeral work of art and architecture entirely built of snow and ice. Every winter, this unique hotel is completely redesigned and rebuilt, offering an unforgettable experience in the only hotel of its kind in North America.
Whether for a guided tour, a Nordic overnight stay, a wedding or a private function, the Hôtel de Glace is sure to dazzle visitors with its unique style and spellbinding décor. Guests can choose to enjoy a cocktail served in a glass made of ice or spend the night in one of the 44 theme rooms and suites and relax in the outdoor hot tubs and sauna.
Every inch of the hotel is created out of ice, including the furniture. To make the rooms more liveable, beds are covered with furs, blankets and sleeping bags tested to arctic temperatures. Although you might not get four-star service, the attraction has seduced over a million people around the world since its opening in 2001. Only 4-km from the north end of Québec City
a visit might just add to your Canada experience.  – Compiled

TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS: Inmates, some with firearms, rioted at a prison in Honduras on Friday, killing at least 18 people and injuring 16 others, authorities said.

The violence, which occurred in Tela in the Atlántida region on the Caribbean coast, came several days after Honduras declared a state of emergency in its prison system. The measure suspended civilian leaders in prisons and replaced them with a special commission led by military and police officers.
However, the transfer of control to the special commission had not been completed when the riot broke out at the Tela prison, said José Coello, a spokesman for the new prison command system.
Security forces quickly deployed to the prison to restore order and begin an investigation, Coello said.
The military and police takeover of prisons in Honduras is scheduled to last six months. Authorities want to use that time to root out corruption and violence in the prison system.

397,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/notre-dame-cathedral-to-miss-first-christmas-in-centuries/,"
PARIS: Notre Dame kept Christmas going even during two world wars — a beacon of hope amid the bloodshed.
Yet, an accidental fire in peacetime finally stopped the cathedral from celebrating Midnight Mass this year, for the first time in over two centuries.

As the lights stay dim in the once-invincible 855-year-old Paris landmark, officials are trying hard to focus on the immediate task of keeping burnt-out Notre Dame’s spirit alive in exile through service, song and prayer.
It has decamped its rector, famed statue, liturgy and Christmas celebrations to a new temporary home pending the restoration works, just under a mile away, at another Gothic church in Paris called Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois.
And there it will remain, as works slowly progress to rebuild the cathedral after the April 15 fire destroyed its lead roof and spire and was moments away from engulfing its two stone towers.
“This is the first time since the French Revolution that there will be no midnight Mass (at Notre Dame),” cathedral rector Patrick Chauvet said.
There was even a Christmas service amid the carnage of World War I, Chauvet noted, “because the canons were there and the canons had to celebrate somewhere.” During World War II, “there was no problem,” adding that only once was it closed for Christmas to his knowledge: After 1789, when the anti-Catholic French revolutionaries turned the monument into “a temple of reason.”
Christmas-in-exile at Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois this year will be a history-making moment.
“We have the opportunity to celebrate the Mass outside the walls, so to speak… but with some indicators that Notre Dame is connected to us,” Chauvet said.
Those indicators include a wooden liturgical platform that has been constructed in the Saint-Germain church to resemble Notre Dame’s own. A service will be led at midnight on Dec 24 by Chauvet to a crowd of faithful, including many who would normally worship in the cathedral, accompanied by song from some of Notre Dame’s now-itinerant choir.
The cathedral’s iconic Gothic sculpture “The Virgin of Paris,” from which some say Notre Dame owes its name, is also on display in the new godly annex.
The 14th-century masterpiece, which measures around two metres (six feet) and depicts Mary and baby Jesus, has come to embody the officials’ message of hope following the fire, after it was spared from destruction by a “miracle.”
“It’s a miraculous virgin. Why? Because at the time of the fire, the vault of the cathedral completely crashed. There were stones everywhere, but she was spared. She could have naturally received the vault on her head and have been completely crushed,” Chauvet said.
He recalled the moment on the night of the fire when he discovered it was saved, as he was holding hands with French President Emmanuel Macron on the cathedral’s forecourt. Around midnight as the flames subsided, they were finally let inside to look. Chauvet pointed and exclaimed to Macron: “Look at the Virgin, she is there!”
He said later that Notre Dame’s workmen on the ground implored him to not remove the statue from the cathedral, crying that during the restoration “we need it. She protects us.”
Chauvet said having it nearby for Christmas is comforting.
“She lived very much in Notre Dame. She watched the pilgrims, all the 35,000 visitors a day … It keeps us going,” Chauvet said.
Another reason for hope: Since November, after months in the dark, the facade of the cathedral is being lit up after dusk for the first time since the fire. Tourists over the festive period can now see the famed gargoyles and stone statues at night in their full illuminated splendor from the adjacent bridges, although the forecourt is still closed.
Cathedral officials carefully chose Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois as the new temporary home because of its proximity to Notre Dame, just next to the Louvre, allowing ease of movement for clerics who lived near the cathedral. Also, because of its prestigious history.
It was once a royal church that boasted among its faithful French kings, in the days when they lived in the nearby Louvre Palace. The kings, Chauvet explained, would simply cross the esplanade to come and attend Mass.
Since September, the church has been welcoming the cathedral’s flock each Sunday.
Though Notre Dame has moved liturgically to a new home, Notre Dame will always remain Paris’ cathedral — officials are at pains to point out — so long as the bishop’s physical chair, or “cathedra” doesn’t move.
Derived from the Greek word for “seat,” and giving the building its very name, a cathedral’s entire identity technically boils down to the presence of a chair.
“The cathedra is at the cathedral and so it remains Notre Dame Cathedral, which is the cathedral in the heart of Paris,” Chauvet said.
It is not only the faithful who have been displaced since April’s devastating blaze.
Notre Dame was home to a vibrant 160-strong choir-school, which provided singers for each and every one of the cathedral’s some 1,000 annual services. Midnight Mass at Christmas was always a special event in the year: One of the rare times the entire choir sung together and used the cathedral’s famed acoustics to their fullest.
Instead of disbanding, this now-homeless chorus of singers, ranging in age from 6 to 30, has too honed an upbeat message and decided to continue on in a divided form. Different sections of the choir put on concerts in churches, such as Saint Eustache and Saint Sulpice, in Paris and beyond. On Christmas Eve, its members will sing at various yuletide events, including at Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois, as well as, bizarrely, at the Russian Circus.

But don’t mention the term choir-in-exile to one of the choir’s directors, Henri Chalet.
“I’d rather use ‘beyond the walls’… ‘Exile’ brings it back to sadness. Obviously, there is a lot of sadness and desolation for us to no longer be in our second home. But there is also a lot of hope because it is only a phase,” Chalet said.
In the grand scheme of things, five or six years of restoration for an 855-year-old cathedral “is nothing at all,” Chalet reasoned. Macron declared in the days after the blaze it would take a mere five years to restore the cathedral — a timeline many experts deem unrealistic.
Notre Dame choir singer Mathilde Ortscheidt, 29, left a little more space for melancholy as she regretted her absence at last year’s Midnight Mass.
“To think that I was ill last Christmas…thinking that I would go again this year with no problem!” she said.
On the first rehearsal she attended after the blaze, she said she “felt such a pain and such sadness” because the cathedral was where she began as a singer.
For the singers, the unique acoustics produced by the cathedral’s massive dimensions are sorely missed as the choir continues its mission in other venues.
“When we balanced it right, it was the most beautiful feeling of just hearing it resonate through this enormous space,” Ortscheidt said.
Despite having “to walk around a lot now” people have got used to the choir’s new lifestyle, she said, and it was just a matter of time before there will be song in the cathedral once again.

LUCKNOW: A court sentenced a former lawmaker from India’s ruling party to life imprisonment for raping a teenager, his lawyer said on Friday, the highest-ranking Indian politician to get such a significant jail term in recent years.
Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, was convicted earlier this week under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Sengar, who was later expelled from the party, had pleaded not guilty.

The court in Delhi also fined him 2.5 million rupees ($35,000), Sengar’s lawyer Tanveer Ahmad Mir said.
“He got his punishment. I am very happy … Today we got justice,” the India Today television network quoted the woman’s sister as saying.
The case gained national attention last year when the accuser, who was a teenager in 2017 when she says she was raped, tried to kill herself, accusing the police of inaction.
In July, a truck crashed into a car she was travelling in. Two of her relatives were killed and she was injured. Since then the family has been provided with security.
Her case was the latest in a country where sexual violence against women is unabated despite enacting some of the world’s toughest laws.
Public outrage has been mounting over the lack of speedy justice for victims.
Sengar is expected to appeal against the decision at the Delhi High Court, his lawyer said, and the case can run for years in Indian courts.

399,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/russian-security-officer-dead-5-injured-in-moscow-shooting/,"MOSCOW: An unidentified gunman opened fire Thursday outside the Moscow headquarters of Russia’s top security agency, killing one officer and wounding five others, officials said.
The Federal Security Service, or FSB, said the assailant was acting alone and didn’t enter its building. Earlier, it said the assailant had been “neutralized” — a term usually used by Russian officials when an assailant is killed.

The Health Ministry said that five other people were wounded in the shooting, including two security officers who were badly injured by the gunman. One of the wounded is a civilian, said Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for Russia’s main criminal investigation body.
The FSB, which is the main successor agency to the Soviet-era KGB, wouldn’t give further details or comment on the attacker’s motives.
The FSB said the shooting occurred near its main headquarters on Lubyanka Square, less than one kilometre (about a half-mile) from Red Square.
Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had been informed of the shooting that came shortly after the Russian leader’s annual news conference.
At about the same time when the shooting happened, Putin, a KGB veteran, made a speech at a Kremlin concert for FSB and other Russian security personnel.
In a speech marking the date the Soviet secret police was founded, Putin hailed its officers for their efforts in combating terrorism and organized crime.
In a video shared on social media, loud shots and bangs can be heard just outside the FSB main headquarters. One video featured a burst of gunfire directed at the FSB building, bullets hitting its walls.
Robert Anchipolovsky, an Israeli musician, was on the way to his concert in Moscow when he started filming the street from his car. As he started filming, the shooting began.
“I thought it was fireworks and then I saw how police started to fall on the tarmac and crouch down,” Anchipolovsky told The Associated Press.
Hours after the shooting, the area around the FSB headquarters remained blocked and public transport was rerouted. Law enforcement officers flooded the scene.

They were arrested on November 28 on a beach in the Irrawaddy river delta region while fleeing from western Myanmar’s Rakhine State.
The group of 93, including 23 children, were brought to a court in the delta town of Pathein to listen to the testimony of an immigration officer who accused them of not having necessary documents for traveling.
If convicted they face up to two years in prison.
“They said they ran away because conditions are difficult over there,” said defense lawyer Thazin Myint Myat Win, referring to Rakhine State where most members of Myanmar’s Rohingya community live.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar to Bangladesh in 2017 to escape a military-led crackdown that UN investigators have said was carried out with “genocidal intent” and included mass killings and rapes.
Some 600,000 Rohingya are living in conditions the United Nations has described as deplorable in Rakhine State, subject to restrictions on movement that touch almost every aspect of their lives including healthcare and education.
Many try to flee, often on boats bound for Malaysia, Indonesia or elsewhere in Southeast Asia, particularly after the end of the rainy season in November, when the sea is calmer.
Girls wearing colorful head scarfs and boys were lined up in the court to listen to the testimony before adults were brought in.
They cried as the judge spoke to them through a translator.
“You cannot make a noise in the court during the hearing. If so, you will lose your rights,” judge Khin Myat Myat Tun told them.
One of the defendants told the court they had not illegally entered the country. The judge told him their lawyer would make that point and he did not need to do so now.
The next hearing is on January 3.
In recent weeks, several groups of Rohingya have been arrested while attempting to flee by boat.
In November, a Pathein court sentenced 14 people to two years in jail for illegal travel.

Protests have spread across India since the Hindu nationalist government pushed the new law through parliament last week, and mark strongest show of dissent since Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept to power in 2014.
The latest fatalities in the southern coastal city of Mangaluru took the death toll from the protest-related violence to seven.

A police spokesman said 20 officers were injured in the clashes in Mangaluru, and a curfew had been imposed there until midnight on Dec. 22.
“Police forces are deployed across the city and the law and order situation right now is quite peaceful and everything is under control,” said police spokesman Guru Kamat.
In Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, and one which has been a tinder-box for communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims, authorities ordered mobile internet and text messaging services in seven districts to be taken down until Saturday.
Awanish Kumar Awasthi, the state official issuing the order, said the move was aimed at preventing the spread of inflammatory material that could worsen the law and order situation. Police in Uttar Pradesh also detained around 100 suspected troublemakers.
In New Delhi, police put extra security around Jama Masjid, one of the country’s largest mosques, ahead of Friday prayers.
And the women’s wing of the main opposition Congress party demonstrated outside the home of Home Minister Amit Shah who is leading the change in citizenship law that sets religion as one of the criteria for granting citizenship for the first time.
The new law makes it easier for people from non-Muslim minorities in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who settled in India prior to 2015 to obtain Indian citizenship.
Critics say the exclusion of Muslims is discriminatory, and the award of citizenship based on religion undermines India’s secular constitution.
Opponents see the law as the latest step by Modi’s government to marginalise Muslims, who make up 14% of India’s population.
The government says the law is aimed at helping religious minorities facing persecution in the largely Muslim neighbouring countries.
Some of the most violent protest have been in Assam, a northeast state bordering Bangladesh. Assamese people are angered by the encouragement being given to immigrants, regardless of their religion.

BEIJING: An Earth observation satellite jointly developed by China and Brazil was launched into space on Friday under a bilateral programme seen as a template for broader cooperation among BRICS nations.
The China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite-4A was launched on a Long March-4B rocket in the northern Chinese province of Shanxi, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
The satellite was the sixth developed under the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) programme that began in 1988. The satellites are designed for Earth observation from orbit for non-military use.
The CBERS-4A will support the Brazilian government’s monitoring of the Amazon rainforest and changes in the country’s environment, according to Xinhua.
Another eight satellites were put into orbit by the same rocket, including a wide-range, multi-spectral, remote-sensing microsatellite donated to Ethiopia.
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – collectively known as BRICS – have been in talks on a framework agreement to create a constellation of satellites for Earth remote-sensing and share data obtained by each others’ satellites.
Each country will provide one to two satellites to the constellation, according to the China National Space Administration in 2018.
The CBERS satellites would be included in the constellation programme.
Currently, only South Africa in the BRICS bloc does not have satellites of its own.

China‘s Xi says HK, Macau affairs “totally” internal affair
Macau’s patriotism key for city’s success – Xi
Xi’s visit expected to kick start economic diversification
Security clampdown during visit, ferry, train services curtailed

MACAU: Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Friday China would never allow foreign forces to interfere with its special regions of Hong Kong and Macau, as he swore in a new pro-Beijing government for the gambling hub of Macau.
Xi, speaking at a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of Macau’s handover to Chinese rule, heaped praise on the former Portuguese colony for its patriotism and loyalty but did not refer directly to six months of anti-government protests in the nearby former British colony of Hong Kong.

“I must emphasize, since Hong Kong and Macau’s return to the motherland, dealing with these two Special Administrative Regions’ affairs is entirely China‘s internal affairs and none of the business of foreign forces,” Xi said.
“We do not let any external forces interfere.”
Macau returned to Chinese rule on Dec. 20, 1999, with the same “one country, two systems” formula aimed at ensuring a high degree of autonomy under which Hong Kong is governed.
While protesters in Hong Kong, across the mouth of the Pearl River, are furious about what they see as Beijing’s erosion of their freedoms, Macau has seen little dissent.
Beijing denies undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy and has repeatedly blamed foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, for stirring up trouble in the Asian financial hub.
Xi, wearing a black suit and maroon tie, swore in new Macau chief executive Ho Iat-seng and his administration, which will run the enclave of several islands for the next five years.
Under a large Chinese flag and a smaller Macau one, Xi shook hands with Ho, who was selected in August by a largely pro-Beijing committee in a similar process to the way Hong Kong’s leader is chosen.
Xi made no reference to Macau’s casino industry, which accounts for more than 80% of its revenues, but encouraged diversification and urged it to grasp opportunities brought by a regional development zone known as the Greater Bay Area.
He also stressed further integration with the mainland, although he did not announce any specific steps.
Officials and corporate executives have been expecting Beijing to reward Macau for its loyalty – in contrast to the defiance on the streets of Hong Kong – with measures including a new yuan-denominated stock exchange.
‘ROCK SOLID’
Xi said Macau’s patriotism was “the most important reason” for the success of its “one country, two systems formula of governance”.
Xi said China would be unwavering in the defence of its sovereignty.
“The will of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty, security and interest in development is rock solid,” Xi said.
“The forward steps of the Chinese nation’s rejuvenation are unstoppable.”
Xi said he was pleased that Macau had implemented national security legislation, unlike Hong Kong which has yet to do so because of widespread opposition.
Residents of Macau enjoyed “law-based rights, freedoms” in one of the world’s safest cities where people “rationally” expressed different views, he said.
Macau has been decked out for the anniversary with flags and red banners over schools, office towers and draped along roads.
But security and border controls have been on lockdown for Xi’s three-day visit, which ends on Friday, to prevent any spillover of dissent from Hong Kong.
Journalists, activists and even the heads of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong were barred from entering the city in the run-up the visit. Macau authorities have not commented on the issue.
Transport services were restricted with operators citing security concerns.
More than half of Macau’s population of 620,000 immigrated from China in recent decades which has helped foster more affinity for the mainland than in Hong Kong, where most people were born in the territory.
Millions of dollars have been spent on Chinese government-linked youth associations that encourage study on the mainland.
Xi said he hoped Macau would establish more patriotic associations to “perfect” governance and ensure stability and prosperity.

404,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/un-deadline-to-send-north-korean-workers-home-likely-unmet/,"SEOUL: North Korea stands to lose a rare legitimate source of foreign currency, worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year, if nations that employ its people as guest workers abide by a UN order to send them all home by this weekend.
Sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council in December 2017 after North Korea tested a long-range missile required member states to repatriate all North Korean workers from their territories within 24 months, a deadline that arrives Sunday.
There are no UN penalties for not following through, however, and it appears unlikely that there will be a mass exodus of the thousands of workers still believed employed in places like China and Russia.
But if even half of North Korean workers were sent back home, North Korea would still suffer financially, said analyst Oh Gyeong-seob at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification.
THE NUMBERS
In China, Russia and elsewhere, there is strong demand for cheap North Korean workers.
The US State Department previously estimated there were about 100,000 North Korean workers worldwide, and civilian experts said those workers brought North Korea an estimated $200 million to $500 million in revenue a year.

North Korean workers abroad are under the constant surveillance of their country’s security agents, toil more than 12 hours a day and take home only a fraction of their salaries, with the rest going to their government. Human rights organizations have called them modern-day slaves, but their jobs are highly coveted in North Korea.
According to interim reports that member states submitted to the UN, 23,245 North Korean workers have so far been repatriated. But those figures don’t include China, which hasn’t publicized its own report, or a dozen other countries that have yet to submit their reports and are believed to have employed North Koreans.
CHINA
The estimate for the number of North Koreans working in China has been as high as 50,000 to 80,000, with the vast majority working in factories in the country’s northeast along the long border with North Korea. China hosts the most North Korean workers.
Lim Soo-ho, a sanctions expert at Seoul’s Institute for National Security Strategy, said Beijing would find it difficult to persuade local governments in the region to send those workers home as their small special economic zones mainly rely on North Korean labour.
Lim said he has seen no signs that the number of North Korean workers in northeastern China was decreasing.
Kim Donggil, a Korea expert at Beijing’s Peking University, said China would be lax in enforcing repatriation.
Staff at North Korean restaurants in Beijing shut their doors and hung up phones when asked about whether they would be sending North Korean employees back home.
RUSSIA
The interim UN reports show that about 80 per cent of the North Koreans repatriated worldwide were from Russia, where most were employed in the construction, forestry and logging industries.
A Russian interim report said the number of North Koreans with valid work permits in the country decreased to 11,490 in late 2018 from 30,023 a year earlier. Public records show the Labor Ministry hasn’t issued a single work authorization for North Korean workers this year.
There are signs that more North Korean workers are preparing to return home.
North Korea’s national airliner, Air Koryo, temporarily increased the number of flights from Vladivostok to Pyongyang in the second half of December, while train tickets this month from the Russian city of Ussuriysk to Pyongyang have already sold out, according to Russian data.
One company, the Yenisei construction company based in Krasnoyarsk in eastern Siberia, said they no longer employ any North Korean workers and are in fact going out of business.
“North Korean workers were good for us from many aspects — soft power, economics, political influence,” Russia’s ambassador to North Korea, Alexander Matsegora, said in a recent interview with the Vladivostok radio. “Now we are going to lose all that.”
ELSEWHERE
The United Arab Emirates repatriated 823 North Korean workers, more than half of the North Koreans who were earning income in the country, as of December 2017, according to an interim report by the country in March.
Qatar told the UN in March that there were only 70 North Koreans working in the country, down from about 2,500 in January 2016. Most of the North Koreans had been working in construction, though Qatar has said none of them had ever worked on construction sites related to the 2022 World Cup.
Kuwait, which once had thousands of North Korean labourers, said it has sent back more than half of them.
Vietnam said in June that it repatriated 51 North Korean workers. Singapore said in March that it revoked the work permits of all North Korean nationals and had not granted new ones.
Experts say North Korea has also sent workers to at least 13 African nations, including Uganda, Angola, Ethiopia, Senegal, South Africa and Equatorial Guinea. Only Equatorial Guinea has filed an interim UN report, though it didn’t give a say how many North Koreans had been repatriated.

405,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/2-firefighters-die-3-hurt-as-wildfires-ravage-australia/,"PERTH: Two volunteer firefighters died Thursday while battling wildfires ravaging Australia’s most populous state, forcing Prime Minister Scott Morrison to cut short his family holiday as authorities braced for temperatures to soar in New South Wales at the weekend.
Geoffrey Keaton, 32, and Andrew O’Dwyer, 36, were in a truck convoy fighting blazes southwest of Sydney when a tree fell and caused the vehicle to roll off the road. The two men, both fathers to 19-month-old children, died at the scene while three other firefighters were injured and taken to a hospital.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the injured firefighters were in stable condition.
Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons spent the night consoling families of the victims.
“To not be coming home after their shift is a tremendous grief and I applaud the families and the loved ones for their remarkable comprehension of what’s been unfolding,” he told reporters.
“Both of these men were very well respected, they were very close, they’re a close-knit brigade, they’re a very community-focused brigade, work together, socialize together, they’re very interactive together.”
Morrison said the two firefighters were “bravely defending their communities with an unmatched spirit and a dedication that will forever set them apart amongst our most courageous Australians”.
“Their sacrifice and service saving lives and saving properties will be forever remembered. I wish those injured all the best in their recovery,” he added.

The Rural Fire Service said up to 40 houses could be destroyed southwest of Sydney.
Cooler conditions provided desperately needed relief Friday, but scorching temperatures are forecast at the weekend with Sydney’s western suburbs tipped to reach 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit).
New South Wales declared a seven-day state of emergency Thursday as around 2,000 firefighters battle 100 wildfires across the state. Around 3 million hectares (7.4 million acres) of land has burnt nationwide during a torrid past few months, with six people killed and more than 800 homes destroyed.
The annual Australian fire season, which peaks during the Southern Hemisphere summer, started early after an unusually warm and dry winter.
The Bureau of Meteorology said Wednesday was the hottest day on record in Australia with an average of 41.9 Celsius (107.4 F), beating the landmark set a day earlier by one degree.
Adelaide, in the southeast, is currently in the midst of a heatwave peaking at a sizzling 46 Celsius (115 F) on Friday, while Melbourne was forecast at 44 Celsius (111 F), which would be the Victoria state capital’s hottest since the devastating Black Saturday wildfires in 2009.
Melbourne on Friday was shrouded in smoke wafting from the New South Wales wildfires much like the haze that has often blanketed Sydney during the past month, making its iconic skyline barely visible.
The unprecedented conditions has reignited debate on whether Australia’s conservative government has taken enough action on climate change. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas.
Protesters on Thursday camped outside Morrison’s Sydney residence demanding urgent action on climate change.
Morrison has copped criticism for going on a family holiday in Hawaii during the wildfires crisis, but said he would cut short his vacation and return to Sydney on Saturday.
“I deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,” Morrison said. “I have been receiving regular updates on the bushfires disaster as well as the status of the search for and treatment of the victims of the White Island tragedy.”

406,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/few-minds-changed-but-political-passions-roused-as-trump-formally-impeached/,"PHOENIX: Jim Williams, a 66-year-old steelworker and supporter of US President Donald Trump, watched in astonishment this week as hundreds of people gathered on a Phoenix street corner to demand the House of Representatives impeach the Republican.
“I had to come and see it for myself, I can’t believe there are that many people here in Phoenix who want to impeach the president,” said Williams, a Republican and member of Bikers for Trump. “I mean, the economy’s good, people are working, unemployment is down. He’s kept promises.”
Months of hearings into whether Trump abused power by withholding military aid to Ukraine while asking it to investigate a re-election rival have done little to change Americans’ views on his presidency: Strong majorities of Democrats believe he should be impeached, while strong majorities of Republicans say he should not.
But they appear to have raised the level of political engagement among many of the dozens of voters interviewed by Reuters this week ahead of Wednesday’s House vote to impeach Trump. He became only the third US president to be impeached and now faces trial in the Republican-led Senate.
At businesses, restaurants, rallies and shops, Reuters spoke with more than 50 voters in four districts that will play a critical role in deciding the Nov. 3 presidential election: Pinellas County, Florida; Maricopa County, Arizona; Northampton County, Pennsylvania, and Racine County, Wisconsin.
More than a third of those interviewed said they had become more politically active – citing the impeachment proceedings as one reason – and planned to knock on doors, donate money or join rallies intended to boost voter turnout.
Given that the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to oust Trump, how that energy plays out in next year’s campaign will determine the president’s political future.
“You at least have to go through the process,” said Jack Zerbe, a 36-year-old software developer in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. “I’m hoping there are some swing voters who actually care.”
Concern over Trump‘s conduct in office inspired Zerbe to make plans to campaign for next year’s Democratic presidential nominee, whoever it is, although he worries Trump will be re-elected.

‘I’M SO INCENSED’
On Tuesday, about 200 Trump supporters packed into a Clearwater, Florida, sports bar to bemoan the looming House vote and sketch out next moves.
Sunnie Duke, 60, said membership in the Tampa Bay Trump Club where she volunteers had nearly doubled to 6,900 since the start of the summer.
“I’m so incensed, I told all of my children and grandchildren that for the holidays this year you’re getting a cause from me and I’m going to write a check on behalf of each of you to re-elect President Donald Trump,” Duke said.
Jerry Pritchard, the 53-year-old chairman of a precinct Republican committee in Northampton, Pennsylvania, said the impeachment process played to Trump‘s advantage – an assertion the president makes that is undercut by polling.
“It’s going to push the people to say: ‘Wait a minute, we voted for Trump,'” Pritchard said over coffee.
Pritchard said he called his US representative, Democrat Susan Wild, several times in the past week to complain about her support for impeachment. He has knocked on doors for past Republican candidates and plans to do so for Trump in 2020.
“I can’t wait to stand up in my town hall next Tuesday and lay it all out about Donald Trump,” Pritchard said.
Anger over the impeachment inspired Bruce Ashford, 59, to mount a solo protest in Racine, Wisconsin, waving a handmade “Trump 2020″ at motorists in freezing temperatures on Wednesday.
“I probably won’t be out here if it weren’t for the impeachment … the proceedings are not warranted,” said Ashford, whose past political activity had been limited to voting.
Now he plans to work to re-elect Trump, going door-to-door to talk to voters: “I want to get out the word and engage people.”

‘WHOLE SITUATION IS UNBELIEVABLE’
In St. Petersburg, Florida, Lyndee Lindsey joined a crowd of about 300 people calling for Trump‘s impeachment.
It was not her first political event, but it represents a change of sides. The 61-year-old retiree was once a Republican who worked for Florida politicians, but became a Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Until recently, Lindsey was reluctant to join political events because her husband works with state Republicans. But she said she felt compelled to become more active as the impeachment investigation advanced.
Now, she said: “I donate, I attend events, and I’ve done a couple of drives to register voters and I plan to do more.”
Similarly, Lee Bryant, a 58-year-old US Navy veteran, said concerns over Trump‘s actions prompted him to get more involved with Pinellas County Democrats.
“I’ll do whatever needs to be done, phone banking, sign waving, getting more people involved,” he said. “This whole situation is unbelievable.”
The Phoenix crowd that stunned Williams with its opposition to Trump included Jolie Runyan, 55, attending her first political rally.
The tour director said she planned to join future voter turnout efforts.
“I’m not afraid to speak truth to power. Evil prevails when good people do nothing,” said Runyan, holding a sign that read: “Impeach.”

407,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/putin-says-impeachment-case-against-trump-is-fabricated/,"MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that US Democrats had impeached President Donald Trump for “fabricated” reasons in order to reverse his 2016 election victory.
Putin, speaking at his annual year-end news conference, said he expected Trump to survive the proceedings and stay in office.
The US House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to impeach Trump, but Putin, like most observers, said he expected the Republican Senate to acquit him.
“It’s unlikely they will want to remove from power a representative of their party based on what are, in my opinion, completely fabricated reasons,” said Putin.
“This is simply a continuation of the (US) intra-political battle where one party that lost an election, the Democratic Party, is trying to achieve results using other methods and means.
“They first accused Trump of a conspiracy with Russia. Then it turned out there wasn’t a conspiracy and that it couldn’t be the basis for impeachment. Now they have dreamt up (the idea) of some kind of pressure being exerted on Ukraine.”
Putin nevertheless criticised the United States in general for what he called unfriendly steps towards Russia, saying Moscow had adopted a policy of responding in kind.
In particular, he complained about what he said was a refusal to respond to Moscow’s proposals to extend the New START arms control treaty, which limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the world’s two biggest nuclear powers can deploy.
Regarded by many experts as the only thing preventing an unfettered arms race between the two Cold War rivals, the treaty can be extended for another five years, beyond its expiry date in February 2021, by mutual agreement.
“So far there’s been no answer to our proposals,” said Putin. “And if the New START treaty doesn’t exist anymore, there will be nothing in the world to curb the arms race. And that, in my view, would be bad.”

Interior Minister Arturo Murillo recently brought charges against Morales, alleging he promoted violent clashes that led to 35 deaths during disturbances before and after he left the office.
Officials say he ordered supporters to blockade cities in order to force the ouster of interim President Jeanine Áñez, who took over when Morales resigned on Nov. 10 after a wave of protests and under pressure from the police and military..
Morales, who first flew to Mexico and now is based in Argentina, has repeatedly denied the charges as a setup.
Morales said Tuesday that he would campaign for the presidential candidate of his party in elections expected within the next several months, though a date has not been set. The candidate from Morales’ Movement Toward Socialism party is yet to be chosen,and the former president cannot run in the new elections.
Bolivia’s first indigenous president has described the movement that pressured him to leave as a coup d’état.
Critics of the long-ruling leader had accused him of using fraud to win a fourth straight term in office in an Oct 20 vote, An audit by the Organization of American States backed up the allegations, saying it found evidence of vote-rigging.
Morales retains a strong following in Bolivia and has an ally in the government of Argentine President Alberto Fernández, who took office two days before the former Bolivian leader arrived in the country.
Bolivia’s interim government has expressed concern that Morales could use Buenos Aires as a campaign headquarters and might plot his return home.

The former minister has called the government’s decision to reopen a criminal case that had been closed politically motivated. A court ordered Patali Champika Ranawaka detained pending an investigation.
Ranawaka was Sri Lanka’s urban development minister before current President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected on Nov. 16,. Ranawaka was arrested at his home at the direction of the attorney general, state television Rupavahini reported.
Nishara Jayarate, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said Ranawaka was arrested on suspicion of committing a rash and neglect act causing grievous injury and then switching drivers. The victim now needs help to walk and his speech is slurred.
Ranawaka has said he was not in his car when the accident happened and that the motorcyclist hit his car while his chauffeur was driving it. Ranawaka has also said the case was closed with a fine issued to his chauffeur but that the country’s new government reopened it for political revenge.
Ranawaka was a Cabinet member in the government of Rajapaksa’s brother, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Ranawaka’s defection in 2014 triggered the fall of that government.

410,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/us-and-india-pledge-cooperation-as-domestic-crises-play-out/,"WASHINGTON: The United States and India agreed on Wednesday to expand defence, science and technology cooperation as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said impeachment would not distract the Trump administration on national security matters
Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper met their Indian counterparts for security talks at the State Department as the House debated impeachment charges against President Donald Trump. The House voted later Wednesday to impeach the president, setting up a Senate trial.
Pompeo said “the noise and silliness” in Washington would not affect the administration’s focus on US national security.
The US and India are each dealing with domestic political crises: the US with impeachment, India with widespread protests and violent clashes in India over a new citizenship law.
“The world should know that despite all the noise, the chaos, the media asking questions that are completely unrelated to the reason we are here today, that the leaders of our two nations are working diligently to protect the American people, to develop a relationship that’s important strategically for the coming decades between the United States and India,” Pompeo said.
“We won’t let the noise and the silliness in Washington, DC, distract us from that,” he said at a news conference with Esper, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh.
Asked whether he would participate as a witness in a Senate trial if the House impeached Trump, Pompeo said he would produce State Department documents and testify if the requests were “appropriate and required by law.”

Democrats have complained that Pompeo’s previous responses have been disingenuous because the department has not produced any documents in response to impeachment investigators’ requests. Department officials did testify before the impeachment inquiry but only over the administration’s objections and under subpoena.
“My participation will continue to be precisely that which the law requires,” Pompeo said.
Pompeo’s comments were the only remarks related to the impeachment and came after the meetings ended.
During the talks, the four men said they had agreed to improve defence cooperation, primarily through increasing troop levels during joint military exercises and promoting the capacity of India’s smaller neighbours to participate in UN. peacekeeping operations.
The two sides also discussed China’s growing global footprint, a matter that is of particular concern for both the US and India, and challenges on the Indian subcontinent, notably the rivalry between India and Pakistan.
As the Trump administration grapples with impeachment, India’s government is dealing with protests over a new law that grants citizenship on the basis of religion and has drawn deep opposition. It provides a path to citizenship for Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and other religious minorities who are in India illegally but can demonstrate religious persecution in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. It does not apply to Muslims.
Critics say the Citizenship Amendment Act is the latest effort by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist-led government to marginalize India’s 200 million Muslims, and a violation of the country’s secular constitution.
The Trump administration has spoken out forcefully against repression of Muslims and other religious minorities in China and Myanmar, but has remained relatively silent on India’s proposed law, which Jaishankar defended as a humanitarian gesture. Pompeo demurred when asked how or whether the US would respond to the enforcement of the law.
“We care deeply and always will about protecting minorities, protecting religious rights everywhere,” he said. “We honour Indian democracy as they have a robust debate inside of India about (this) issue. The United States will be consistent in the way that we respond to these issues, not only in India but all around the world.”
Jaishankar rejected the suggestion that the law is intended to discriminate against Muslims. he said it was aimed at helping the most vulnerable minorities.
“It is a measure which is designed to address the needs of persecuted religious minorities from certain countries,” he said. “If you look at what those countries are and therefore what those minorities are, you would understand why certain religions were identified.”

411,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/indian-police-detain-protesters-against-citizenship-law-as-ban-imposed/,"NEW DELHI: Police in New Delhi detained dozens of people protesting against a new citizenship law that is seen as anti-Muslim as they began to gather in front the Indian capital’s historic Red Fort, in defiance of a ban on public gatherings.
Citing law and order concerns following violent protests against the law during the past week, officials said authorities imposed bans on Thursday in parts of the capital and two big states.
Police in Uttar Pradesh, a northern state that is India’s most populous, also declared as ban on protests. In the southern state of Karnataka, whose capital Bengaluru is home to many multinational technology companies, a ban was placed until Decemeber 21.
In Delhi, students, politicians and rights activists had called for a peaceful demonstration at the Red Fort against the legislation pushed through by the country’s Hindu nationalist government a week ago.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has dug his heels in over the law that lays out a path for people from minority religions in neighbouring Muslim countries – Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan – who had settled in India before 2015 to obtain Indian citizenship.
“We are here to peacefully demonstrate against this law,” Mohammed Maz, a bearded middle-aged protester told Reuters as he was detained by police in front of the Red Fort.
Protesters say the exclusion of Muslims betrays a deep-seated bias against the community, which makes up 14% of India’s population, and that the law is the latest move in a series by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to marginalise them.

“If not today when will you stand up for your country? … Join the Citizen’s March against the divisive Citizenship Act. Join me at Lal Quila ( Red Fort) 11:00 am,” Yogendra Yadav, an academic turned politician, tweeted.
Delhi police said the permission to hold the gathering had been denied because of the law and order situation. Train stations including at the Red Fort and university areas were shut to stop people from travelling to the site.
On Sunday, police stormed New Delhi’s Jamia Millia University, firing tear gas and wielding batons to break up a protest by hundreds of students, injuring scores.
In violent protest in another part of the capital this week, protesters, many of them masked, fought pitched battles with police.
Anger against the Modi government has burst into the open after a series of moves that were seen as advancing a Hindu-first agenda in a country that has long celebrated its diversity and secular constitution.
In August, the government took away Muslim majority Kashmir’s autonomy and later the Supreme Court cleared the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on a site disputed by Muslims, and had been a flashpoint for years.

412,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/pakistans-musharraf-calls-death-sentence-a-personal-vendetta/,"ISLAMABAD: Speaking from his hospital bed in Dubai, Pakistan’s former military ruler Pervez Musharraf said a special court’s decision to sentence him to death in a high treason case was the result of a “personal vendetta”.
Musharraf, who was tried and sentenced in absentia, said in a video released late on Wednesday the allegations against him were politically motivated and it was “an unprecedented case in which neither the defendant, nor his lawyer were allowed to defend the case.”
An anti-terrorism court sentenced Musharraf to death on Tuesday after finding him guilty of high treason and subverting the constitution in 2007.
The verdict sent shudders through the military, which has ruled Pakistan for a large portion of its history and remains highly influential. The army issued a strongly worded statement accusing the court of ignoring legal process, defending Musharraf’s patriotism, and saying the ruling had caused “pain and anguish” in the ranks.

The 76-year-old Musharraf seized power in a coup in 1999 and later ruled as president.
In November 2007, Musharraf suspended the constitution and imposed emergency rule – a move which sparked protests. He resigned in 2008 to avoid the threat of impeachment.
When Nawaz Sharif – an old rival whom he deposed in the 1999 coup – was elected prime minister in 2013, he initiated a treason trial against Musharraf and in 2014 the former general was charged for high treason.
“This case was taken up only due to personal vendetta by some people against me,” Musharraf said in the video statement.
Musharraf travelled to Dubai, where he is receiving medical treatment, after a travel ban was lifted in 2016 and he has refused to appear before the court, despite multiple orders.
His political party had earlier said it would challenge the verdict.

China and Russia this week proposed relaxing some UN sanctions
US opposes any easing in sanctions on NKorea, holds veto power
US special envoy to NKorea visiting Beijing on Thursday

BEIJING: China touted its proposal offering sanctions relief to North Korea as the best option to diffuse tensions, calling on Thursday for a compromise in the standoff between Washington and Pyongyang over the latter’s nuclear and missiles programmes.
The proposal, made jointly with Russia on Monday, calls on the UN Security Council to lift some sanctions on exports and foreign workers to “break the deadlock” in the stalled talks between Pyongyang and Washington.

“This is the best plan in the current situation to resolve the stalemate in the denuclearisation of North Korea and for its peace and stability,” Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui told reporters, adding that a political solution is still achievable despite a recent rise in tensions.
The comments come as the US special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun is set to arrive in the Chinese capital on Thursday for talks.
The US holds veto power in the 15-member council and remains opposed to any sanctions relief, however, making the China-Russia resolution unlikely to go through.
Biegun’s public call to Pyongyang for renewed dialogue during a visit to South Korea earlier this week went unanswered, underscoring the reclusive state’s discontent at a lack of concessions for its decision to halt nuclear tests and long-range missile launches.
Pyongyang has conducted a series of weapons tests and waged a war of words with US President Donald Trump in recent weeks, stoking fears the two countries could return to a collision course.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Trump met for the first time in Singapore in June 2018 and have met twice more since, but scant progress toward denuclearisation has been made and Kim has given Trump until the end of this year to show flexibility.
North Korea’s UN envoy declared this month that denuclearisation was off the table, and some analysts say Pyongyang could soon conduct a test for a major strategic weapon such as an intercontinental ballistic missile.
“We hope that the concerned parties will practice restraint and meet each other halfway, and work through dialogue to realize positive interactions and quickly find a meeting point to find a resolution,” Luo said.

414,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/bushfires-surround-sydney-as-australias-nsw-state-declares-emergency/,"SYDNEY: Australia’s most populous state declared its second emergency in as many months on Thursday as extreme heat and strong winds stoked scores of uncontrolled bushfires, some on Sydney‘s doorstep.
In the same week the continent recorded its hottest day on record, thick smoke blanketed the harbour city, shrouded the Opera House and brought many outdoor activities to a halt.
The state of emergency declaration gave firefighters broad powers to control government resources, force evacuations, close roads and shut down utilities across New South Wales, where 100 wildfires are burning.
With more than half of those fires uncontrolled and temperatures forecast to hit 45 degrees Celsius (113°F) in some areas, officials warned residents to be on high alert.
“The biggest concern over the next few days is the unpredictability, with extreme wind conditions, extremely hot temperatures,” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.
Days out from Christmas, a time when many Australians head to the coast for the holidays, Berejiklian warned people to reconsider travel plans.
“Please do your research before you embark anywhere across the state,” she said. “Please make sure you are prepared to change your plans should circumstances change.”
Australia has been battling wildfires across much of its east coast for weeks, leaving six people dead, more than 680 homes destroyed and nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland burnt.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has weathered a storm of criticism on social media in recent days for going on an overseas holiday during the emergency, adding to criticism that his government is failing to deliver adequate climate change policies.
As the media reported Morrison was in Hawaii with his family to enjoy a break, about 500 protestors gathered outside his official Sydney residence to demand urgent action on climate change. Morrison’s office refused to confirm his whereabouts.
One protestor carried a sign reading, “ScoMo, where the bloody hell are you?” referencing the leader’s nickname and a decade-old international advertisement for Tourism Australia that was banned in several countries because the language was deemed offensive.
Some 1,700 firefighters have been deployed across NSW, but officials warned that was still not enough to cover every potential danger and urged people in high risk areas to evacuate while it was still safe to do so.
“There are simply not enough fire trucks for every house. If you call for help, you may not get it,” the Rural Fire Service said in a statement. “Do not expect a fire truck. Do not expect a knock on the door. Do not expect a phone call.”
The current state of emergency will last for seven days, while a total fire ban that has been in place since Tuesday will remain until midnight on Saturday.
SMOKY SYDNEY
Three major fires were burning around Sydney, which is home to more than 5 million people. One megafire in the Kanangra Boyd National Park to the city’s southwest had crept to the very outskirts of Campbelltown, a suburb of 157,000 people.
Sydney is ringed by large areas of bushland, much of which remains tinder dry following the driest Spring on record.
Many commuters have donned breathing masks in recent weeks as air quality has plunged to hazardous levels not previously seen in the city.
NSW Ambulance Commissioner Dominic Morgan said the service had experienced a 10% surge in call-outs for patients suffering respiratory conditions over the past week and urged susceptible people to remain indoors and keep their medication close.
The heightened fire danger in NSW comes as Australia is in the grip of a nationwide heat wave.
The country recorded its highest average maximum temperature of 40.9C (105.6F) on Tuesday, and Bureau of Meteorology data shows that record was likely to be exceeded again this week.
The extreme conditions have been exacerbated by a warming climate, which is triggering large-scale protests in a country that has been committed to exploiting its vast coal reserves.
Australia’s low-lying Pacific neighbours have been particularly critical of the coal-rich nation’s climate policies following modest progress at the U.N. climate talks in Madrid.
“It was particularly disappointing to see our Pacific cousins in Australia actively standing in the way of progress at a time when we have been watching in horror as their own country is ablaze,” Marshall Islands president Hilda Heine said in a statement on Wednesday.

415,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/1-dead-3-hurt-in-stabbings-at-oregon-shopping-centre-town/,"BEAVERTON: A 20-year-old attacker carried out a series of stabbings and carjackings at a suburban Portland shopping centre and in a nearby town Wednesday, killing one person and wounding three others before being arrested, authorities said.
Police in the city of Beaverton said two people were stabbed inside a Wells Fargo bank and a man was stabbed at a gym next door.
After the stabbings, the assailant stole the man’s car and drove into the suburb of Tigard, where he stole another woman’s car and stabbed her, Officer Matt Henderson said at a news conference. He eventually got out of the car and ran from officers before being caught, police said.
A woman who was killed was a bank customer, Wells Fargo spokesman David Kennedy said. Another woman was critically injured there, and the two people whose cars were stolen had serious injuries, authorities said.
“This was a horrific crime, and our hearts go out to those victims and their families,” Beaverton Police Chief Ronda Groshong told reporters. “This is an ongoing investigation with several crime scenes. … It’s going to take a while to process.”
Police didn’t release any details about the motive for the attack or the suspect’s or victims’ identities.
Noushin Luluvachi from nearby Bella Salon told The Oregonian/OregonLive that police cars flooded the plaza and authorities ordered businesses to keep their doors closed.
Dillon Prickett said he pulled up a coffee shop next to the bank and saw officers going inside. Prickett, a 35-year-old from the town of Aloha, later saw a badly injured woman being brought out on a stretcher.
“She had so much bandaging on her face,” he told The Oregonian/OregonLive.
The bank and salon are part of a shopping centre that also includes a credit union, Planet Fitness, Safeway and Starbucks, among other businesses.

SYDNEY: Australia must abandon criticism of China and see the development of its largest trading partner as an opportunity if bilateral relations are to improve, Beijing’s ambassador to Canberra said on Thursday.
Relations between Australia and its most important trading partner have deteriorated in recent years amid accusations that China is meddling in Australia’s domestic affairs. Canberra also fears China is seeking undue influence in the Pacific region.
Souring relations have strained bilateral trade, prompting some business executives to urge Australia’s conservative government to prioritise economic policy above national security and human rights.
In rare public comments, Cheng Jingye, China’s ambassador to Australia, described 2019 as a “mixed year” for the relationship.
“I think it is important … to look at each other’s development as an opportunity, rather than a threat,” Cheng told reporters in Sydney.
Australia has for months sought to ease bilateral tensions by refraining from public criticism of China.
But in recent weeks, several senior government officials have said Canberra would not be silenced about concerns such as China’s militarisation of the South China Sea, its treatment of ethnic minorities and its detention of Australian citizens.
In October, Australia drew a rebuke from China when it said it would continue to speak about the treatment of the Uighur people in Xinjiang province in China.
China has been widely condemned for setting up complexes in remote Xinjiang it describes as “vocational training centres” intended to stamp out extremism and teach new skills.
The United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained.
Cheng denied the allegations.
“Uighurs in detention is utterly fake news,” said Cheng, who then showed journalists a video that portrayed Uighurs as radicals.
Cheng also denied Australia’s allegations that China was mistreating a Chinese-born Australian writer detained by Beijing for almost a year.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australian consular officials who recently visited Yang had reported “unacceptable” conditions, including isolation and daily interrogations, sometimes while he was shackled.
Cheng insisted China is treating Yang Hengjun, a former Chinese diplomat turned online journalist and blogger, humanely.
Yang was formally arrested in August on suspicion of espionage, seven months after he was detained in the southern city of Guangzhou.
Espionage is punishable by death in China.

“Today marks the culmination in the House of one of the most shameful political episodes in the history of our nation. Without receiving a single Republican vote, and without providing any proof of wrongdoing, Democrats pushed illegitimate articles of impeachment against the president through the House of Representatives,” White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.

Articles pass largely on party-line vote
Stage is set for Senate trial next month
Impeachment comes ahead of 2020 election campaign

WASHINGTON: Donald Trump on Wednesday became the third US president to be impeached as the House of Representatives formally charged him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in a historic step that will inflame partisan tensions across a deeply divided America.
The Democratic-led House’s passage of two articles of impeachment on a mostly party-line vote sets the stage for a trial next month in the Republican-controlled Senate – friendlier terrain for Trump – on whether to convict and remove him from office.
The abuse of power article was passed on a 230-197 vote. The obstruction article was passed by 229-198.
The House action sets the stage for a trial next month in the Republican-controlled Senate – friendlier terrain for Trump – on whether to convict him and remove him from office. As the House voted, Trump was addressing a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan.
No president in the 243-year history of the United States has been removed from office by impeachment. That would require a two-thirds majority in the 100-member Senate, meaning at least 20 Republicans would have to join Democrats in voting against Trump – and none have indicated they will.
Trump, who is seeking another four-year term in the November 2020 presidential election, has called the impeachment drive an “attempted coup” by Democrats seeking to nullify his 2106 election victory. The Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, has predicted there is “no chance” his chamber will remove Trump when it holds its trial.
The first of the articles accused Trump, 73, of abusing his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, as well as a discredited theory promoted by the president and beneficial to Russia that Democrats conspired with Ukraine to meddle in the 2016 election.
Democrats said Trump held back $391 million in security aid intended to combat Russia-backed separatists and a coveted White House meeting for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as leverage to coerce Kiev into interfering in the 2020 election by smearing Biden.
The second article accused Trump of obstruction of Congress by directing administration officials and agencies not to comply with lawful House subpoenas for testimony and documents related to impeachment.
Trump has denied wrongdoing and called the impeachment inquiry, launched by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in September, a “witch hunt.”
During a daylong debate before the vote, Pelosi read the US Pledge of Allegiance and said: “We are here to defend democracy for the people.”
“If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty. It is tragic that the president’s reckless actions make impeachment necessary,” Pelosi said.
As the debate unfolded, Trump on Twitter called the proceedings “AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA” and on his party. On the House floor, Republicans accused Democrats of seeking to use an unfair, rigged process to nullify the 2016 election.
“The matter before the House today is based solely on a fundamental hatred of our president. It’s a sham, a witch hunt – and it’s tantamount to a coup against the duly elected president of the United States,” Republican Representative Mike Rogers said.
Republican Representative Mike Kelly compared the impeachment to the Japanese attack on Hawaii’s Pearl Harbor in 1941, calling the House proceedings another “date that will live in infamy” – similar to the words Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt used to describe the raid that killed about 2,400 people and led to America’s entry into World War Two.

POLARISED COUNTRY
Trump‘s election has polarized the United States, dividing families and friends and making it more difficult for politicians in Washington to find middle ground as they try to confront pressing challenges like the rise of China and climate change.
The impeachment vote comes ahead of Trump‘s 2020 re-election campaign, which will pit him against the winner among a field of Democratic contenders, including Biden, who have repeatedly criticized Trump‘s conduct in office and promised to make it a key issue.
Reuters/Ipsos polls show that while most Democrats want to see him impeached, most Republicans do not. Televised hearings last month that were meant to build public support for impeachment appear to have pushed the two sides further apart.
The House vote on Wednesday was just the latest, but also unquestionably the biggest, in a string of controversies that have buffeted the turbulent presidency of the New York real estate mogul and former reality TV personality.
Central to the impeachment inquiry was a July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma while his father was US vice president.

Trump has accused the Bidens of corruption without offering evidence. They have denied wrongdoing.
A rough transcript of the call released by the White House showed Trump asking Zelenskiy, elected only three months earlier and eager for American support, to “do us a favor” and conduct the investigations in coordination with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
Giuliani in the prior months had engaged in a concerted effort to persuade Ukraine to carry out the investigations. Testimony before House committees showed that Giuliani helped engineer Trump‘s removal last May of the US ambassador to Ukraine, who was perceived as a roadblock to those investigations.
Impeachment is a remedy devised by the United States’ founders, wary of a monarch on American soil after breaking away from Britain and King George III in the 18th century, to enable Congress to remove a president who has committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.”
Only two previous presidents have been impeached. The House in 1998 impeached President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice arising from a sexual relationship he had with a White House intern, but the Senate acquitted him. The House impeached President Andrew Johnson in 1868, focused on his removal of the secretary of war, but he was acquitted by one vote in the Senate.
In 1974, President Richard Nixon resigned after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment in the Watergate corruption scandal but before the full House could pass them.

Students don’t have religion,” Vatsala Singh, a senior producer at The Quint wrote.
Numerous alumni of the Jamia Milia Islamia expressed solidarity after students were attacked for peacefully protesting the exclusion of Muslims from a new citizenship law that grants citizenship to religious minorities in India. Scores of students were attacked at Jamia Millia University in India’s Capital as protests intensified, many were injured.
One of the major spirits of democracy is people freely exercising their right to assemble and protest peacefully. Delhi Police’s recent crackdown on the protesting-students, however, led many into believing that the same right was being dishonoured in the world’s largest democracy.
Vatsala said it’s hard for her to not feel shattered after having witnessed how incidents have transpired in a place where she spent a major chunk of her life. “Shame on you Delhi Police and the government under whose orders Jamia property was destroyed. You may not feel anything for the students in JNU, AMU, Jamia, but remember, your children and siblings will have to pick universities when they grow up. Would you want them to be tear-gassed, lathi-charged, trapped inside toilets and libraries, gasping for breath?” wrote Singh on her Facebook page.

Karan Prashant Saxena, a senior content producer at Hindustan Times shared with THT Online how every alumni, irrespective of different organisations they belonged to, started collating and documenting factual evidence the moment things escalated in the campus. “This is journalism at its best,” he added. “People will be stunned at the quality of education that is provided here if they don’t see the University as is being portrayed by the central government. The people really need to open their eyes and see.”
For Prerna Lidhoo, Principal Correspondent of Fortune India, it would not be easy to revisit her campus for a long time now after seeing and hearing of the almost week-long ruckus. “We’ve had food in the canteen that was ransacked, sat in that library, used those washrooms. It’s like our home was targeted. We hold Jamia in very high regard because that’s one place where you can actually witness the idea of India. It made me who I am. It gave me hope to make something of myself when I was next to nothing.”
“I support my university and students who fought and sacrificed so much so that I can pay back my debts to this place. This is what I have learnt here – to look beyond religion, caste and creed,” Lidhoo concluded.
Even in the midst of all the frustration that has surfaced, the alumni are providing accommodations to those in need. Lidhoo is willing to accommodate 5-10 people in her house after hearing Jamia students are being asked to vacate their hostels.
Talha Ethasham, a senior visual producer at Hindustan Times said Jamia is a place of diversity, not just in the makeup of its student body but also in relation to opinions, and subcultures that mingle, coexist and bring people together regardless of where they come from, what they believe in and what they do in their personal lives.
“For minds stepping out of the shelter of schools, the sense of community within Jamia was a wonderful addition to any young person’s life as a quality to uphold and cherish. It was the people that made Jamia what it was, and is. All that was needed was to let go of preconceived notions that stemmed from the name of the institution and were quite unjustified,” Ethasham shared with us.
Yusra Hussain, senior correspondent at The Times of India, shared how the entire incident has agitated her and all others who have studied at Jamia where police brutality on unarmed non-violent protesters has surpassed all limits. “To think that I spent two years of my life at this campus, at this hostel which is under siege today, has kept me, and others like me up all these nights. I can only imagine what students have felt when the cops barged into the libraries and dark classrooms even as girls screamed out of fear and boys were beaten up. This is unacceptable at so many levels and the government is letting it happen.”
Alumni across the nation took to streets in the wake of the police action while others took to social media to voice their anger and frustration.

Meanwhile, many renowned celebrities are being criticised on social media for not voicing their opinion in favour of their alma mater and against police brutality.
Netizens are upset over the silence of people in power in times of crisis when Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is creating an uproar across the country.

NEW DELHI: India’s Supreme Court on Wednesday postponed hearing pleas challenging the constitutionality of a new citizenship law that has sparked opposition and massive protests across the country. The court said it would consider the pleas on Jan 22.
Protests and widespread condemnation have been growing against the Citizenship Amendment Act, with demonstrations erupting in India over the last week.

The new law applies to Hindus, Christians and other religious minorities who are in India illegally but can demonstrate religious persecution in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. It does not apply to Muslims.
Critics say that the new law is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist-led government’s agenda to marginalise India’s 200 million Muslims and that it goes against the spirit of the country’s secular constitution. Modi has defended it as a humanitarian gesture.
Its passage last week follows a contentious citizenship registry process in northeastern India’s Assam state intended to weed out people who entered the country illegally. Nearly 2 million people in Assam were excluded from the list, about half Hindu and half Muslim, and have been asked to prove their citizenship or else be considered foreign. India is building a detention centre for some of the tens of thousands of people the courts are expected to ultimately determine have entered illegally. Its passage also came as an unprecedented crackdown continued in Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority area, which was stripped of special constitutional protections and its statehood in August. Since then, movement and communications have been restricted in the region.
University students across India have been leading a campaign to have the citizenship law overturned.
On Sunday, marches by students at New Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia University and Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh descended into chaos when police fired tear gas and beat unarmed protesters with wooden sticks.
Scores of students were injured. Police say they acted with restraint.
The police response to the protests has drawn widespread condemnation. It has also sparked a broader movement against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Demonstrations have erupted across the country, with thousands rallying in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka states on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, authorities tightened security restrictions, implementing a curfew in the northeastern state of Assam, where ongoing protests have disrupted daily life in Gauhati, the state capital. They also restricted assembly in a Muslim neighborhood in New Delhi where demonstrators torched a police booth and several vehicles on Tuesday.

421,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/france-on-strike-power-cuts-schools-shut-no-eiffel-tower/,"PARIS: French union activists cut electricity to nearly 100,000 homes or offices. Eiffel Tower staff walked off the job. Even Paris opera workers joined in Tuesday’s nationwide protests across France, singing an aria of anger as workers rallied against the government’s plan to raise the retirement age to 64.
Despite 13 days of crippling train and subway strikes, French President Emmanuel Macron and his government stayed firm. The prime minister declared his “total” determination to reshape a pension system that unions celebrate as a model for the rest of the world but that he calls unfair and destined to collapse into debt.

Lighting red flares and marching beneath a blanket of multi-coloured union flags, thousands of workers snaked through French cities from Brittany on the Atlantic to the Pyrenees in the south.
Hospital workers in scrubs, Air France staff in uniforms, lawyers wearing long black robes — people from across the French workforce joined in the strikes and protests in higher numbers than the last cross-sector walkout last week.
The retirement reform that has brought them together is just one of their many gripes against Macron, a business-friendly centrist they fear is dismantling France’s costly but oft-envied welfare state.
Workers from the hard-left CGT union on Tuesday carried out what they called “targeted” blackouts on electricity networks around Lyon and Bordeaux to call attention to their grievances, and their power.
Several European countries have raised the retirement age or cut pensions in recent years to keep up with lengthening life expectancy and slowing economic growth. Macron argues that France needs to do the same.
Tourists cancelled plans and Paris commuters took hours to get to work Tuesday, as train drivers kept up their strike against changes to a system that allows them and other workers under special pension regimes to retire as early as their 50s. 
“Monument Closed” read a sign on the glass wall circling the base of the Eiffel Tower, which was shut for the second time since the strike, one of the most protracted France has seen in years, started Dec. 5.
“It’s very frustrating for us, unfortunately,” South African tourist Victor Hellberg said, gazing up at the 19th-century landmark. “We had decided to be here for one day and that’s life I suppose.”
Victor Garcia, visiting from Barcelona, said he’s used to protests at home but admitted not climbing the Eiffel Tower’s steps “is kind of a bummer.”
Police in Paris barricaded the presidential Elysee Palace, bracing for violence by yellow vest activists or other radical demonstrators.
Across the French capital, union leaders demanded that Macron drop the retirement reform.
“They should open their eyes,” said Philippe Martinez, the head of the CGT union, said at the head of the Paris march.
With riot police watching closely, protesters carrying humorous signs and colourful costumes marched past the historic Bastille plaza. On the steps of the opera house overlooking the monument, workers sang famous arias and played instruments to defend their special retirement plan.
Bernard Buffet, a costume fitter, is 63 and retiring in April after 35 years at the Bastille Opera, but is protesting in solidarity with younger colleagues.
“The government is stuck on the reform. They are very arrogant,” he said.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe confirmed new negotiations with unions starting Wednesday, but showed no sign of backing down.
“Democratic opposition, union opposition is perfectly legitimate,” he told lawmakers. “But we clearly laid out our plans. And on this plan, the creation of a universal retirement system, my determination … is total.”
He also paid tribute to “the French who go to work despite difficulties.”
In addition to transportation troubles, parents faced shuttered schools and students had key exams cancelled Tuesday as teachers joined in the strike.
Hospitals requisitioned workers to ensure key services Tuesday, as nurses, doctors and pharmacists went on strike to save a once-vaunted public hospital system that’s struggling after years of cost cuts.
Tuesday’s protests upped the pressure on Macron, whose key architect of his pension overhaul had to resign Monday over alleged conflicts of interest.
Unions fear people will have to work longer for lower pensions, and polls suggest at least of half of French people still support the strike. Unions at the SNCF rail authority want to keep the strike going through the Christmas holidays.
While patience was running short among Paris Metro riders squeezing into scarce trains, the strike troubles weren’t enough to scare away some visitors to the City of Light.
Spanish tourist Lydia Marcos, finding the Eiffel Tower unexpectedly closed, shrugged it off and said, “It’s like an excuse to come here another year.”

422,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/china-says-lifting-some-un-sanctions-on-nkorea-could-help-break-deadlock/,"UNITED NATIONS: China and Russia are pushing the UN Security Council to lift some sanctions on North Korea to ease the country’s humanitarian concerns and to “break the deadlock” in stalled denuclearisation talks between Washington and Pyongyang, China’s UN ambassador said on Tuesday.
On Monday, China and Russia proposed the 15-member council lift a ban on North Korea exporting statues, seafood and textiles, and ease restrictions on infrastructure projects and North Koreans working overseas, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters.
“With regard to the sanctions, that’s also something DPRK has concerns (with) and their concerns are legitimate,” China‘s UN ambassador, Zhang Jun, told reporters, referring to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
“If you want them to do something you need to accommodate their concerns. That’s the logic behind China and Russia’s initiative.”
Asked when the draft resolution could be put to a vote, Zhang said: “Once we feel we have strong support then we will take further action.”
Council diplomats met on Tuesday to discuss the draft text. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Britain, Russia or China to pass.
US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft posted on Twitter on Tuesday: “The @UN Security Council has and should always speak in unison on North Korea. We are willing to consider united action, but it must advance the commitments @POTUS Trump and Chairman Kim made in Singapore.”

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump met for the first time in Singapore in June 2018 and have met twice more since, but no progress toward denuclearisation has been made and Kim has given Trump until the end of 2019 to show flexibility.
North Korea‘s UN envoy declared this month, however, that denuclearisation was off the table.
The United States, Britain and France have insisted that no UN sanctions should be lifted until North Korea takes concrete steps to give up its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Pyongyang has been subject to UN sanctions because of those programs since 2006.
A US State Department official said on Monday that now was not the time to consider lifting UN sanctions on North Korea as the country was “threatening to conduct an escalated provocation, refusing to meet to discuss denuclearisation, and continuing to maintain and advance its prohibited weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.”
The sanctions on industries that Russia and China have proposed lifting earned North Korea hundreds of millions of dollars and were put in place in 2016 and 2017 to try to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs.
“What we are going to do is not to further split the Security Council, but to pursue a united approach in obtaining peace and security there,” Zhang said.
“The core goal is to send a constructive, positive message to the parties concerned that we do not want a deteriorated situation, we do not want a confrontation, we do encourage them to go forward instead,” he said.
China hopes the Security Council can speak with one voice on the issue and reach consensus on the draft resolution, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a media briefing earlier on Tuesday.
Concerns were growing internationally that North Korea could resume nuclear or long-range missile testing – suspended since 2017 – because denuclearisation talks between Pyongyang and Washington have stalled.

423,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/nepals-proposed-changes-to-climbing-permits-for-mount-everest/,"The Nepal government has proposed changes to its permit process for climbers on Mount Everest following the deaths of eleven climbers this year. The proposals, and associated criticisms, include:

 Climbers must submit proof of having scaled at least one 6,500m peak in Nepal. Critics argue limiting the provision to Nepal makes no sense.
Climbers must produce a certificate of good health. Critics say it is easy to forge such certificates or find a compliant doctor.
Guides must have three years of experience organising high-altitude climbs. Critics say so many Sherpas can claim such experience that virtually all outfitters will qualify.

424,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/3-dead-in-montana-casino-shooting-suspect-killed-by-police/,"GREAT FALLS: An overnight shooting Tuesday at a Montana casino left three people dead and another person injured, and the suspect was later tracked down and killed by police, officials said.
The shooting happened about 2 am at the Emerald City Casino in Great Falls, along one of the city’s main commercial strips, according to a statement from the Great Falls Police Department.
Police found the bodies of three victims inside the casino when they arrived. A fourth person with a gunshot wound showed up at Benefis hospital for treatment, authorities said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.
City, county state and federal law enforcement officer conducted a citywide search that lasted more than three hours until the suspect was found by officers in a residential neighbourhood about a mile (1.6 kilometres) away.
The suspect was fatally shot by officers about 5:45 am after “engaging law enforcement,” Great Falls Police Captain Jeff Newton said. He did not elaborate, and it was not clear whether that meant the suspect fired his weapon.
“ The entire situation was very dynamic, and the suspect was moving around quite a bit,” Great Falls Police Lieutenant Doug Otto said. “Things unfolded very quickly in a very short period of time.”
Great Falls Public Schools Superintendent Tom Moore said it happened behind an elementary school.
“The response from the Great Falls Police Department was almost immediate,” Moore told the Great Falls Tribune.
The injured person was admitted to Benefis Hospital for unspecified reasons, police said. The person was not identified.
A hospital spokeswoman, Kaci Husted, said the injured person was in stable condition in the intensive care unit. She did not have additional details.
Emerald City Casinos own a chain of restaurants and bars with gambling machines in Great Falls and other Montana locations. A call to the casino where the shooting happened rang unanswered Tuesday morning.
The elementary school near where police killed the suspect cancelled classes and postponed a K-3 grade concert. The school district deployed a team of mental health professionals for students, parents and community members.
The shooting is being investigated by local and federal officers. Officials did not offer a motive for the shooting and said they were not ready to release the name of the man shot by police. Investigators were still trying to figure out how the victims were connected and if anybody else was involved, Otto said.
An inquest into the police shooting of the suspect will be conducted after the investigation is complete.

PANAMA CITY: At least 12 people were killed and another 13 were injured during a shootout among inmates at a jail near Panama City on Tuesday, officials said.
Police said they seized several guns in the incident at La Joyita prison, 16 miles (25 km) east of the capital, including five handguns and three long-barrelled firearms.

President Laurentino Cortizo, who took office in July, said the incident suggested jail guards helped smuggle in the weapons.
“These firearms didn’t fall out of the sky, there was obviously some type of cooperation there for firearms to be brought in,” he said in a statement.
Police official Alexis Munoz said the shooting originated from within the jail, where inmates are grouped according to gang affiliations to avoid confrontations, and that the cause was being investigated.
