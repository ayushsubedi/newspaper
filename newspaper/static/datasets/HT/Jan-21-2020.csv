FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

2,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

3,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

4,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

The ordinance will now be sent to the President for certification.
The Authority, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister, is being set up prior to the international donors’ conference, scheduled for June 25, which aims at seeking support from the international communities to rebuild Nepal.
When the ordinance is certified, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala will nominate four ministers and three experts as members of the high-level body, according to Minister for General Administration Lalbabu Pandit.
Likewise, Vice-Chairperson of the National Planning Commission and Chief Secretary will be members of the Authority.
The post-earthquake Reconstruction Authority will have a chief executive officer also. It will oversee all reconstruction works in the earthquake-hit districts where physical infrastructures have been damaged.
Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam informed that there will be a separate committee of foreign consultants that would be constantly supporting the Authority in its job.
According to the government’s assessment, the tremors caused damage worth Rs 513.38 billion to physical infrastructure and assets, and inflicted income loss of another Rs 187.08 billion.
The government has set the target to collect more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors for the post-earthquake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
 Objectives of International Conference on Nepal’s Reconstruction


Appraise friendly countries and development partners of the socio-economic situation in Nepal in the aftermath of the massive earthquake and share international best practices and experiences on institutional arrangements that lead to effective, transparent and accountable execution of reconstruction programs.

KATHMANDU: The government has set the target to garner more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors’ conference being organised on June 25 for the post-quake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
A study of losses caused by the devastating Gorkha Quake on April 25 and its aftershocks in various regions across the country shows that physical infrastructures worth Rs 512 billion were damaged by the quake and over Rs 666 billion was needed for reconstruction, rehabilitation and new construction.
The government is preparing to collect the assistance by presenting the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) report in the conference prepared by the National Planning Commission for the same.
According to the PDNA report, over Rs 399 billion is necessary for reconstruction and rehabilitation tasks in cultural heritage, education, health and human settlement sectors.
Similarly, Rs 117 billion is needed for reconstruction of agriculture, industry, irrigation and tourism sectors.
Likewise, the PDNA report estimates that it will cost Rs 74.26 billion for reconstruction of media, community infrastructures, hydropower, transport and drinking water and sanitation sectors while Rs 75.11 billion to recover the damaged gender, social security, nutrition, employment, environment and forest areas into previous position.

The consumer price inflation stood at 6.55 per cent in mid-December compared to 3.71 per cent a year ago, thanks to a significant rise in food and beverage inflation over the month.
As per the country’s macroeconomic statistics of the first five months released by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) today, the food and beverage inflation stood at 9.76 per cent, thus creating a pressure on inflation.

The central bank’s report states that prices of vegetables, spices, fruits and pulses and legumes rose significantly in the review month. Likewise, within the non-food and service group, the price of education, clothes and footwear, and furnishing and household equipment subgroups rose moderately in the review month.
Earlier in mid-August, inflation stood at an almost three-year-high of 6.95 per cent following a sharp hike in food prices. It was the first time consumer prices had shot up to this level since September 2016. It is doubtful that the government will be able to meet its target of containing annual inflation at six per cent for this fiscal year if inflation keeps rising in this manner.
Meanwhile, the central bank statistics show that merchandise exports increased by 27 per cent to Rs 47.62 billion in the first five months in the ongoing fiscal year compared to an increase of 12.7 per cent during the same period a year ago. However, merchandise imports decreased 4.2 per cent to Rs 581.26 billion against an increase of 34.2 per cent in the same period of the previous year.
As a result, the total trade deficit narrowed down 6.3 per cent to Rs 533.64 billion in the five months of 2019- 20 though such deficit had expanded 36 per cent in the same period of the previous year.
Similarly, the remittance inflow which had been falling till mid-November increased by 0.1 per cent to Rs 376.99 billion in the review period compared to 31.9 per cent in the same period of the previous year.
However, the current account registered a deficit of Rs 70.32 billion in the review period. Such deficit stood at Rs 119.33 billion in the same period of the previous year.
However, balance of payments (BoP) remained at a surplus of Rs 23.3 billion in the review period against a deficit of Rs 85.32 billion in the same period of the previous year.

The Investment Board Nepal (IBN) and Power Construction Corporation of China (Power China) today inked an agreement to construct the 762-megawatt Tamor Storage Hydroelectricity Project.
Following the agreement, a joint-venture between Hydroelectricity Investment and Development Company Ltd (HIDCL) of Nepal and stateowned Power China Corporation will construct the project on government-to-government (G2G) basis.
As per the agreement, the Nepal-China joint-venture will immediately start to prepare the detailed feasibility study of the project and start construction of the reservoir hydropower project within the next two years.
During Chinese President Xi Jinping’s two-day state visit to Nepal on October 12-13, the Investment Board Nepal (IBN) and Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation (MoEWRI) had awarded the contract to HIDCL-Power China to build the project under public-private-partnership (PPP) model.
Earlier, HIDCL and Power China had jointly submitted a project development proposal at the IBN to build the Tamor hydropower project with a share structure of 46:54 per cent, with the Nepali firm investing 46 per cent and Power China investing 54 per cent of the project cost.
Similarly, in the Madi Multipurpose Hydropower Project, HIDCL will manage 26 per cent and Power China will manage 74 per cent of the total investment.
As per the agreement, the developer will plan, design, build, finance and operate the facilities during the concession period of 30 years. Similarly, the project developer will also be responsible for collecting revenue from the project during the concession period. After the concession period is over, the developer will have to hand over the project to the government.
Studies conducted earlier had estimated the construction cost of the Tamor project at $1.21 billion, including interest during construction, finance cost and the 75-kilometre-long 400 kVA double-circuit transmission line from the project site to Inaruwa in Sunsari district. The Tamor project will cover Panchthar, Taplejung, Terhathum and Sankhuwasabha districts.

Due to the unreliable online system installed by the government at the Department of Foreign Employment (DoFE), foreign job aspirants have been facing problems time and again as the computer server at the department frequently shuts down. As a result, foreign migrants are not able to get mandatory online sticker on time.
Service seekers have said that they have been facing this problem since the last one week but DoFE has not yet been able to resolve the problem.
Ram Yonjan, a service seeker, said that he has been facing this problem since Friday and has not been able to receive the online employment sticker from the labour office at Tahachal. “If the labour office is unable to issue the online sticker by today then I will have to pay a penalty to the company where I have been employed for reporting late,” he said, adding, the government needs to stick to its commitment of providing hassle-free service to the people.
Meanwhile, Bhola Nath Guragain, director at DoFE, said the department’s technical team is working to resolve the server problem. “We are trying to resolve the problem as soon as possible and since there are some core technical problems we have hired a specialist.”
In September 2018, the government had introduced the Foreign Employment Management System so as to control and manage services being provided to foreign migrant workers. And the crux of the problem is that if the central system fails then it tends to affect other services too.
The system can be accessed by all concerned with foreign employment services, including the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MoLESS), manpower companies, line offices under MoLESS, orientation centres, Department of Passport, Department of Immigration, Department of Consular Services, various government agencies, diplomatic missions and Nepali embassies abroad.
“Most of the technical issues related to the problem have been resolved and we hope to fully resolve the issue by tonight,” said Guragain.

As there are high chances of a tussle between the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport and the Ministry of Urban Development regarding who will be responsible in developing and owning urban roads, the Urban Road Standard has not been implemented for various road projects across the country.
On August 19 last year, the Cabinet meeting had approved the standard that was forwarded by the MoUD on August 14 but the document has not been sent back to the ministry for its implementation.
“The reason why the standard has stalled at the Cabinet is that the document has not clearly mentioned certain specifications,” said a senior official from MoPIT, seeking anonymity.
The standard has not clearly mentioned about which roads will fall under the jurisdiction of MoUD and those that will be developed by MoPIT.
As per the official, MoUD has infringed on the jurisdiction of MoPIT while preparing the standard.
“The standard goes against the spirit of the Road Act, so it will be difficult to implement it even though the Cabinet has ratified it,” the source stated.
“We have raised serious concerns on the issue with the Cabinet through our minister,” the source further said. “The document states that even roads which previously fell under Department of Roads, including highways, will be developed by MoUD, which is infringing in our work area.”
Meanwhile, Madhusudan Adhikari, secretary at MoUD, said the ministry is surprised on why Cabinet has still not released the document. “We are the concerned authority but we haven’t received document yet,” he said, adding that this has created difficulties in implementing urban road criteria while building roads. As per the standard, MoUD will be responsible for all categories of roads, including highways, that pass through city areas.
The standard also mentions that the government must construct 1.2-metre-wide bicycle tracks on either side of any urban road. The bicycle tracks need to be built at least one metre away from the road.
Moreover, the standard has also guaranteed pedestrian facilities. It states that footpaths must be constructed along high-traffic urban roads and that there should be a vacant space in between the footpath and bicycle track.
“All roads should be designed and constructed with proper assessment of all environmental and social aspects and their impacts. It must follow environment protection acts and rules of the government,” the standard states.

Executive Chairman of Nepal Airlines Corporation Madan Kharel tendered his resignation today nearly 16 months after his appointment. Kharel submitted his resignation to the Prime Minister’s Office, instead of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation as is the general practice.
According to sources, Kharel was directed by the PMO to tender his resignation ‘due to his failure to expand NAC’s business as expected’.
As per the Cabinet’s decision of 14 September 2018, Kharel was appointed NAC’s executive chairman on 17 September 2018.
According to the NAC Act, Kharel was appointed directly by the government before the tenure of former managing director Sugat Ratna Kansakar ended.
Kansakar at the time was dragged into controversy regarding the process of procuring the wide-body Airbus aircraft.
The Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation had often stated that it was not satisfied with Kharel’s work progress. Even Civil Aviation Minister Yogesh Bhattarai had hinted at changing the NAC leadership if no immediate steps were taken to strengthen the national flag carrier.
On December 29, NAC’s board meeting had sought a five-point clarification from Kharel after he briefed Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli that he was not able to perform as per his plans due to lack of cooperation from the board.
Kharel had been criticised for failing to add more destinations, operating flights to Osaka instead of Narita that has more passenger flow and neglecting flight operations to China. He was also blamed for failing to operate flights smoothly in the domestic sector as NAC’s small aircraft are still grounded.
This is the second time that Kharel has stepped down from a high post at NAC. Prior to this, he had resigned as the managing director in 2015. Even then he was criticised by the government for failing to operate NAC effectively. However, he claimed that he had resigned back then under pressure from the NAC’s trade union. He had served at NAC as MD from 2012 to 2015.

As the attraction for adventure tourism in the country has seen a steady rise in recent times, the number of adventure activities has also been increasing.
One of the most popular adventure activities in the country is paragliding. Paragliding is especially famous in Pokhara. However, in recent years the private sector is pouring investment in paragliding service in Kathmandu Valley as well.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has recently issued permits for two new paragliding zones near Kathmandu Valley. The new paragliding services will be located in Suryachaur and Tistung.
According to CAAN, Nepal Paragliding has received a permit to operate paragliding at Suryachaur. As per the proposal submitted to CAAN, the company will operate paragliding services covering the areas of Suryachaur, Shivapuri and Nuwakot.
The company has received a permit to operate paragliding flights up to a height of 6,500 metres.
Meanwhile, a company named Tistung Paragliding has also received a permit from CAAN to operate paragliding services from Tistung in Makawanpur.
It has received a permit to operate paragliding flights up to a height of 5,000 metres.
As per CAAN, both the zones can be used only from February 27 due to some technical reasons.
As per the private sector, paragliding near Kathmandu saves time for people who want to avail the adventure activity.
For those who come to Nepal just to experience paragliding and for those who don’t have enough time to go out of the valley, paragliding near the valley saves them both money and time.
Prior to this, paragliding services were being operated from Godavari and Shankarapur in Kathmandu.
Meanwhile, recently CAAN has issued the permission for two such zones at Khandbari in Sankhuwasabha district.
Gradually the adventure sport is spreading across the country.

On Friday, gold price rose by Rs 100 a tola to close the trading week at Rs 74,800 per tola. According to Reuters, gold edged higher on Friday but was on track to post its first weekly decline in six as solid Chinese data and a preliminary United States-China trade deal improved risk appetite.
Meanwhile, physical gold purchases gathered steam ahead of the Lunar New Year celebrations in China and Singapore, while demand in India dwindled this week, encouraging retailers to offer more discounts. The Chinese Lunar New Year falls during the last week of January and gold demand is usually boosted during the period, Reuters reported.

Issuing a notice today the IBN has asked the shortlisted company to submit the proposal within 45 days from the date of publication of the notice.
As the government has decided to build and operate NIA as per public-private partnership model, IBN shortlisted the Zürich Airport on September 23 last year to construct the NIA. Out of the other domestic and international firms, Zürich Airport was the only firm that had submitted expression of interest (EoI) for the airport project based on the criteria and standards set by the government.
The other firms to submit the construction proposal of the project included Matrix Enterprises of Nepal, China Airport Construction Group and China State Construction Engineering Company from China, GMR of India, Qatar Airways and Vinci Group of France.
The estimated cost of the project stands at Rs 340 billion ($3 billion). As per the board, the airport will be built in three phases — with the cost of the first phase at $1.21 billion, the second phase at $1.12 billion, and the third phase at $1.12 billion.
The notice further mentioned that the pre-bid conference will be held on February 16.
Meanwhile, on the same day the government has a hearing at the Supreme Court. The SC continued its interim order on December 22 directing the government to halt ongoing construction works at NIA and not to cut any trees at the moment.

TOKYO: Toshiba Corp said on Saturday it “could not confirm existence” of transactions worth some 20 billion yen ($181.59 million) at one of its subsidiaries in the first half of this fiscal year, prompting it to revise past financial statements.
The irregularities, which occurred over multiple years, were uncovered at Toshiba IT-Services Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, as a result of an internal probe launched at the end of November, Toshiba said in a statement.
The company has been trying to win back the market’s trust after a 2015 accounting scandal uncovered widespread irregularities at the laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate for years.
Toshiba said it would eliminate some 20 billion yen worth of sales from net sales in its digital solution segment of its financial statements of the third quarter of the fiscal year that started on April 1, 2019.
It warned that the final impact on profit and revenue are subject to further investigation.

A week after India stopped importing refined palm oil from Nepal, the country’s top export item, the government has formally asked the southern neighbour to allow Nepali traders to export the commodity in the Indian market.
Citing that the ban imposed on import of palm oil is against Nepal-India trade relations and does not align with the spirit of bilateral trade treaties between the two nations, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies (MoICS) today sent a letter to related Indian authorities through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs urging the Indian government to lift the ban imposed on import of the product.
Similarly, the government in its letter sent to the Indian government has stated that the refined palm oil that Nepali traders have been exporting to India is highly refined and complies with the value addition provision. Also, MoICS has stated that Nepali traders have been exporting only consumer packs of refined palm oil to India and Nepal is not a bulk exporter of the commodity.
“We’re not bulk exporters. Nepal exports palm oil in small packages ranging from one kg to 15 kg, which are widely used by Indian households.
Our palm oil exports account for a mere one per cent of Indian imports of the commodity,” informed Nabaraj Dhakal, joint-secretary at MoICS. “We are hopeful that the ban on import of refined palm oil from Nepal will be lifted as India’s import restriction on the product did not primarily intend to curb import of the product from Nepal.”
The Indian government last week had issued a notification stating a complete restriction on import of refined bleached deodorised palm oil and refined bleached deodorised palmolein.
Though the restriction was aimed at taming Malaysia, it also affected Nepal, which had exported refined palm oil worth Rs 8.36 billion to India in the first four months of this fiscal, making it the country’s largest export item.
Though Nepal never had competitive or comparative advantage in exporting palm oil to India, rising export of the product in recent months had been playing a crucial role in raising the country’s export base and narrow down the trade deficit.
Nepali traders import crude palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia, process and package it here, before sending it to India. Traders were lured towards this business as India had imposed a duty of 40 per cent on import of palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia, the two largest producers of palm oil in the world. Nepal’s palm oil, on the other hand, was subject to a duty of just six per cent in India as per the spirit of the bilateral trade treaty.

Slower growth of Indian economy, sluggish remittances, and weaker agro production to keep growth moderate

Kathmandu, 17
An International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission, which recently concluded its discussions for 2020 Article IV consultation in Nepal, has projected economic growth of six per cent in the ongoing fiscal year.
The IMF mission led by Laura Jaramillo concluded that though Nepal’s economy, supported by greater political stability, improved electricity supply and reconstruction activities, is growing above its long-term average in the last few years, the economic growth in 2019-20 fiscal year would be moderate amid slower growth in India (the country’s main trading partner), sluggish remittances, and weaker agricultural production.
Despite this, IMF believes that narrowing of the current account deficit, stabilisation of gross official reserves and slower credit growth will support economic growth further.
The fund sends Article IV mission to its member nations regularly to assess the economic and financial developments.
“Building on the growth and reform momentum, additional policies needs to be continued to support inclusive growth while safeguarding macroeconomic and financial stability,” said Jaramillo.
Citing that the transition to fiscal federalism is a monumental challenge that the Nepali economy faces today, the IMF mission has suggested the government to gear fiscal policies towards containing external pressures and protecting fiscal sustainability. “A fiscal deficit of 4.5 per cent of the gross domestic product would be prudent,” states IMF.
In a bid to protect fiscal sustainability, the fund has said that the overall expenditure envelope of sub-national governments needs to be aligned with available funding, with tight limits on any sub-national borrowing.
Praising the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) for its appropriately taken macro-prudential measures to limit the buildup of systemic risks in the financial sector, the IMF has urged the central bank to continue to closely monitor asset quality of banks and improve monitoring of concentration risk. “A priority reform for the NRB is to strengthen the implementation of monetary policy by putting in place a well-functioning interest rate framework that reduces volatility in short-term interest rates,” said the IMF mission.
Informing that reform efforts in recent years have helped improve the investment climate in Nepal, the IMF said that new legislation and regulations need to be supported by an enabling implementation environment to boost foreign investment further.
Adequate staffing, better skills matching and aligning incentives across and within ministries to ensure high-quality projects move forward in a clear and timely manner would enhance the implementation capacity of legislations, as per IMF.

Winter rain today affected several domestic and international flights being operated from and to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA).
Moreover, hilly and mountainous regions were hit by heavy snowfall, which worsened the situation, largely affecting flight schedules across the country. As per TIA, several domestic flights were delayed or cancelled and a couple of international flights were diverted.
According to TIA, two flights — one each of Thai Airways and Thai Lion Air — coming to Kathmandu were diverted to Dhaka in Bangladesh due to bad weather while other international flights were not affected.
In the domestic sector, all the flights to Tumlingtar and Lukla were cancelled due to the incessant rainfall since last night. Likewise, one flight scheduled for Surkhet of Buddha Air was cancelled, while flights from and to Bharatpur airport were disrupted till 2:00pm today.
Thereafter, the delayed flights resumed their operations.
A flight of Simrik Air scheduled for Pokhara was also cancelled.
Meanwhile, Buddha Air, Yeti Airlines and Shree Airlines were able to operate a flight each this morning from Nijgadh airport. However, in the afternoon all the flights were halted due to low visibility owing to the continuous rainfall. Similarly, chopper flights scheduled for different destinations were also cancelled today.
Around 30 international airline firms and three Nepali airline companies operate around 100 international flights every day at TIA. Likewise, nine fixed-wing domestic air services and 10 chopper firms operate around 400 flights a day at TIA in the domestic sector.

The government is preparing to review the rental fee for factories operating from the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to lure industries inside the government protected area.
The Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies (MoICS) has formed a committee under the coordination of its Joint Secretary Sovakanta Poudyal, to study and review rental fee in Bhairahawa SEZ after the zone witnessed lukewarm response from the private sector despite numerous facilities being offered by the government to industries within the protected area.
The issue of high rental fee tops some of the issues raised by the private sector that they say is discouraging industrialists from setting up factories inside the Bhairahawa SEZ.
Initially, the government had set Rs 150 per square metre as the monthly rental charge for industries inside the Bhairahawa SEZ. However, the government had reduced the fee to Rs 20 per square metre in April 2016 following criticism from the private sector that the earlier rental charge was uncompetitive. Meanwhile, the government is preparing to reduce the rental charge further after the private sector continues to be reluctant to set up industries inside the Bhairahawa SEZ and have been saying the fee is still high compared to different countries.
“We have already started the scientific study regarding the rental fee inside Bhairahawa SEZ. The fee will be reviewed if it is uncompetitive compared to what is practised by other countries,” said Poudyal.
Though established with the prime objective to promote export-oriented industries and boost the country’s exports, the Bhairahawa SEZ has not been able to attract investors significantly.
Initially, industries inside SEZs were required to export 75 per cent of their production. However, the government later relaxed this provision for industries to 60 per cent after industries inside the SEZ expressed their inability to comply with the export provision. Meanwhile, the government is also likely to further slash the mandatory export provision in the near future as a few MoICS officials have said it is quite high.

With an aim to enhance the contribution of the commerce sector to the economy or gross domestic product (GDP) of the country, the government is introducing a 10-year longterm strategic plan to enhance the country’s commerce sector.
For the purpose, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies (MoICS) has sought consultancy services to draft the 2020-30 strategic plan and has released the terms of reference (ToR) of the plan.
Motilal Dugad, state minster for MoICS, informed that the ministry will soon publish the notice for the consultancy service. “At present, we have released the terms of reference, which will help anyone interested to formulate a plan.”
He further emphasised that the strategic plan is needed to increase the contribution of exports to the GDP, which has been gradually declining.
“Contribution of exports to the GDP stood at 7.3 per cent in fiscal 2007-08, which dropped to 2.8 per cent in 2018-19,” he informed.
In the past few years, Nepal has witnessed a continuous increase in merchandise trade with sluggish export growth and surge in imports causing trade deficit to balloon.
“The government’s major concern is to overcome the escalating trade imbalances with trading partners,” said Dugad.
As per the ToR document, the purpose to frame the strategic plan is to incorporate all the efforts of reform and enhancement programmes of the MoICS in framework and support trade facilitations while ensuring legitimate trade flows without distorting the economy. The consultancies will also have to provide support in designing MoICS’s annual plan and action, and provide guidance in allocation of time schedule and financial resources from the government and development partners.
Moreover, the firms will have to support in seeking political support at higher level in efforts of trade management through mainstreaming trade to national economic policy and ensuring proper supply and distribution of merchandises and services, provide proper and accurate information to determine the critical and prioritised programme areas and communicate to the development partners with a view to achieving sustainable development and reforms without any overlapped efforts.
As per the ministry, the plan has objectives to introduce right models to enhance trade competitiveness of the country, increase contributions of trade to GDP, employment and earnings and provide world-class trade-related services to the citizens.
The consultancy will have to review the trade performance, and assess institutional framework, trade facilitation and infrastructure. It will also have to analyse existing commercial diplomacy mechanisms, review market access conditions and constraints, and also assess and review resources availability.
Moreover, the firm will have to assess overall trade and investment environment, review private participation and contribution. It will also have to assess and review research, development and promotion activities.
The firm will also have to identify the most pragmatic implementation mechanism of the strategic plan. The report must be submitted to the government within 150 days.

The government’s positive stance on promoting the secondary market propelled the Nepal Stock Exchange (Nepse) index by 2.02 per cent today to breach the psychological threshold of 1,300 points after nearly eight months.
The last time the local bourse had closed above the 1,300-point mark was on May 30.
Share investors’ recent optimism can be attributed to numerous reasons — including easy availability of margin loans and seasonal factors. But today’s surge of 26 points that led to the benchmark index to settle at 1,310.23 points was due to the comments by Chairperson of Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON), Bhisma Raj Dhungana.
Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, SEBON Chairperson Dhungana had assured to implement all the necessary measures to lift the secondary market and said the board would soon issue licence to open another stock exchange.
“We are currently studying the documents submitted by five companies to establish another stock exchange in the country,” he had said.
Consequently, the sensitive index, which measures the performance of class ‘A’ stocks, today rose by 1.4 per cent or 3.9 points to 282.87 points. The float index that measures the performance of shares actually traded also went up by 1.97 per cent or 1.8 points to 92.86 points.
The share investors’ sentiment had earlier been boosted after Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada had also hinted that the government would support the secondary market.
Prakash Rajhaure, an independent analyst of stock market, said the sentiment had turned positive following the finance minister’s statement and got a further boost from the SEBON chair’s address yesterday.
According to him, the market movement is expected to be northbound for the next couple of weeks.
“Should the government implement the earlier 58-point secondary market reform plan, the share market will rise further,” he added.
Apart from others, all the subgroups recorded gains today. Among the gainers, two subgroups surged by more than four per cent, five ascended by more than three per cent, two went up by more than two per cent, while the remaining two rose by less than two per cent.
Finance subgroup soared by 4.16 per cent or 26.55 points to 665.01 points, followed closely by manufacturing, which advanced by 4.03 per cent or 97.31 points to 2,509.81 points.
Microfinance subgroup rose by 3.82 per cent or 76.18 points to 2,069.38 points.
Life insurance sub-index inclined by 3.76 per cent or 242.58 points to 6,700.76 points. Hotels subgroup went up by 3.74 per cent or 74.55 points to 2,066.99 points. The trading subgroup ascended by 3.4 per cent or 28.59 points to 868.38 points and mutual funds sub-index jumped by 3.25 per cent or 0.32 point to 10.05 points.
While non-life insurance and development banks rose by more than two per cent, banking and hydropower subgroups went up by 1.69 per cent and 0.78 per cent, respectively.
However, others subgroup shed 0.25 per cent or 1.7 points to 684.9 points.
Altogether, 5.05 million shares of 181 companies were traded through 17,295 transactions that amounted to Rs 1.69 billion today.
The firms that surged by the daily limit of 10 per cent today included NIBL Pragati Fund, whose share price closed at Rs 7.99, Multipurpose Finance Company at Rs 121, ICFC Finance at Rs 187, Global IME Laghubitta Bittiya Sanstha at Rs 1,320 and Tinau Mission Development Bank at Rs 187.
Among the top losers were Mahila Sahayatra Microfinance Bittiya Sanstha, which was down by 2.67 per cent to Rs 760 and Himalayan Power Partner that dropped by 1.91 per cent to Rs 154.

China Q4 GDP grows 6.0% y/y (vs poll 6.0%, Q3’s 6.0%)
2019 growth slows to 6.1% (poll 6.1%, 2018’s 6.6%) – weakest pace since 1990
Partial Sino-US trade deal a relief but may offer only modest boost
More stimulus expected in 2020 – a crucial year for leaders
December data shows quickening factory output, investment growth

BEIJING: China‘s economic growth slowed to its weakest in nearly 30 years in 2019 amid a bruising trade war with the United States and sputtering investment, and more stimulus steps are expected this year to help avert a sharper slowdown.
But data on Friday also showed the world’s second-largest economy ended the year on a firmer note as trade tensions eased, suggesting a raft of growth boosting measures over the past two years may finally be starting to take hold.
This year is crucial for the ruling Communist Party to fulfill its goal of doubling GDP and incomes in the decade to 2020, and turning China into a “moderately prosperous” nation.
Fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) rose 6.0% from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, steadying at the same pace as the third quarter, although still the weakest in nearly three decades.
That left full-year growth at 6.1%, the slowest annual rate of expansion China has seen since 1990. Analysts had expected it to cool from 6.6% in 2018 to 6.1%.
“I think it (the apparent stabilisation of growth in the fourth quarter) is sustainable,” said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.
“We have seen improvement in industry. We have seen efforts (from policymakers) to make sure the economy continues to grow, especially efforts in the financing of infrastructure.”
Policy sources have told Reuters that Beijing plans to set a lower economic growth target of around 6% this year from last year’s 6-6.5%, relying on increased infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown.
On a quarterly basis, the economy grew 1.5% in October-December, also in line with expectations and the same pace as the previous three months.
MORE SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT
December data released along with GDP showed a surprising acceleration in factory output and investment growth, while retail sales grew at a steady, solid pace.
Industrial output grew 6.9% in December from a year earlier, the strongest pace in nine months. Analysts had expected growth to dip to 5.9% from 6.2% in November.
Fixed-asset investment rose 5.4% for the full year, versus expectations for a 5.2% increase, the same as in the first 11 months of the year.
Retail sales rose 8.0% in December on-year, compared with forecasts for 7.8% and November’s 8.0%.
Real estate investment rose 9.9% in 2019, slowing slightly from 10.2% in the first 11 months of the year. But growth in December slipped to a two-year low as authorities continued to clamp down on speculation to keep home price rises in check.
Beijing has been relying on a mix of fiscal and monetary steps to weather the current downturn, cutting taxes and allowing local governments to sell huge amounts of bonds to fund infrastructure projects.
Banks also have been encouraged to lend more, especially to small firms, with new yuan loans hitting a record 16.81 trillion yuan ($2.44 trillion) in 2019.
The economy has been slow to respond, however, and investment growth had slid to record lows.
Even with additional stimulus and the trade war truce, economists polled by Reuters expect growth will cool further this year to 5.9%.

The Cabinet has given a clean chit to Nepal Rastra Bank Deputy Governor Shiba Raj Shrestha, who was under investigation for allegations of misconduct.

Interestingly, the Cabinet itself had in November directed the Ministry of Finance and central bank to conduct a probe against Shrestha on the charge of ‘various misconducts’, including his involvement in jeopardising the country’s financial stability, promoting money laundering and taking facilities unlawfully during his foreign trips.
However, Gokul Prasad Baskota, spokesperson for the government, said Shrestha was given the clean chit after allegations against him could not be proved. Addressing a regular press meet of the government to make public decisions of the Cabinet over this week, Baskota said, “We had initiated the probe earlier as questions were raised against his conduct.”
Following the government’s decision, Shrestha is expected to resume his post and office from Sunday.
After the direction from the Cabinet, the central bank had formed a committee to investigate allegations levelled against Shrestha under the coordination of Sri Ram Poudyal, a member of NRB’s board of directors. The committee had submitted its probe report to the government in the second week of December, stating that though Shrestha had acted against the law in some instances, most of the mistakes made were due to systemic deficiencies/weaknesses.
However, during the investigation, the team uncovered evidences that proved Shrestha had assisted a few institutions that had breached financial stability in the country, according to a committee member.
On the basis of the report submitted by the committee, the government had sought clarification from Shrestha a few weeks ago. However, Shrestha was given a clean chit after his response was found to be ‘satisfactory.’
Ever since the probe was started against Shrestha, he had been refuting all allegations against him claiming that they were aimed at tarnishing his credibility in the run-up to the race for the post of the governor. NRB Governor Chiranjibi Nepal is retiring after around three months and deputy governors are often the primary contenders for the post.
Shrestha had stressed that all his decisions were based on the law and as per consultations with the NRB management and board members. THT could not contact Shrestha as his mobile ‘was out of reach’.

Amid the government’s attempt to lure foreign investors and investment in Nepal, frequent attacks witnessed by firms and projects with share of overseas companies have raised concerns about security of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country.
Whether offices and infrastructure of telecom firm Ncell being targeted in the recent months or attacks on Upper Karnali Hydropower Project and Arun III Hydropower site last year, such incidents discourage foreign investors from coming to Nepal, as per experts.
Moreover, they opined that failure to ensure security to FDI projects will directly affect FDI flow into Nepal, which will ultimately affect various development goals of the country.
“Investors are highly sensitive and they take attacks on FDI or domestic projects very seriously. As investment security is the first thing that an investor looks for, it is the responsibility of all to ensure that investment and investors in Nepal are secured,” said Maha Prasad Adhikari, chief executive officer of Investment Board Nepal (IBN).
In the recent months, various unidentified groups have been attacking infrastructure of Ncell in different parts of the country, which has not only caused financial losses worth millions of rupees but also resulted in disturbance of essential telecom services being provided by the company. Nearly 20 towers of Ncell in 15 districts have reportedly been attacked over the period of last two weeks. Moreover, an explosion in front of the Ncell head office at Nakkhu, Lalitpur in February last year had killed one and left two others injured.
On Tuesday, the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) — the telecom sector regulator — also issued a notice urging related government agencies to curb and control attacks on infrastructure of telecom firms citing that they are directly related to essential telecommunication services.
The attacks on Ncell and its infrastructure, however, are not exceptions. In June last year, an unidentified group had detonated an improvised explosive device at a contact office of Upper Karnali Hydropower Project, damaging some infrastructure.
Similarly, unidentified groups had detonated three improvised explosive devices at the powerhouse of under-construction Arun III Hydropower Project in Sankhuwasabha district in February last year. Both of these are FDI projects.
“We should not generalise these incidents, but should be cautious and make collective efforts to prevent such attacks on projects,” added Adhikari.
Investors in the country said that as such news spread like wildfire, investors are discouraged from coming to Nepal.
“Investors across the world take attacks on FDI projects and firms as a major threat to investment.
Along with security issues, other issues related to policy ambiguity, ineffective implementation of laws and government’s unnecessary pressure to investors have been discouraging investment in Nepal in recent months,” informed Shekhar Golchha, senior vice-president of Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI).

AirAsia, which had suspended services to Nepal from October 2018, has refuted that the airline company has any outstanding payment to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) in respect to its operations into Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA).
Amid CAAN officials claiming that AirAsia is yet to clear over Rs 180 million in dues to the government, the airline company has stated through a press statement that it has no dues.
“The overdue payments claimed are due to long outstanding bills which were not made by AirAsia’s former local travel partner in Nepal — Incentive Group of Companies (IGC),” reads AirAsia’s press statement.
However, Rajkumar Chhetri, spokesperson for CAAN, said that the airline company has yet to clear dues worth Rs 180 million — Rs 50 million in respect to its operation at TIA and Rs 130 million in penalties for delayed payment.
“AirAsia has to be responsible towards ensuring that the government gets the payment of the due amount as soon as possible,” said Chhetri.
While AirAsia passed the buck to its former local travel partner in Nepal, IGC officials were not available for comment on this issue. Moreover, it is said that officials of IGC are currently out of contact.
Meanwhile, CEO of AirAsia Benyamin Ismail said in the statement, “Although this is not our dispute, we continue to work closely with CAAN and TIA to assist to resolve this matter as soon as possible. We want to support Visit Nepal 2020 and AirAsia will consider reinstating services to Nepal if this matter can be finalised or redirected to IGC.”
“In the spirit of resolving the issue amicably with CAAN, AirAsia has not only been current with its payments, but had in good faith, remitted additional payments on top of the monthly charges to CAAN, which resulted in additional operational costs and resources on the part of AirAsia,” reads the airline’s statement.

The government has managed to spend merely 13.72 per cent of the allocated capital budget in the first half of 2019-20, clearly indicating its failure to expedite project works and development.
As per the statistics of the Financial Comptroller General Office, the government managed to spend only Rs 58.39 billion till mid-January, out of the Rs 408 billion allocated under capital expenditure for the current fiscal. While the capital expenditure in first half of last fiscal had stood at over 14 per cent, development spending in the same period of fiscal 2017- 18 had been recorded at more than 16 per cent.
The government had expressed its commitment to improve budget spending this fiscal, defending the tepid spending in the previous years stating that it was busy forming necessary regulatory frameworks.
However, the plague of low capital spending has continued even this year, which might also affect the government’s economic growth target of 8.5 per cent in the ongoing fiscal year.
Economist Biswo Poudel said that the trend of low capital spending of the government is not going to change unless it adopts proper budget planning and implementation mechanism from the initial months of the fiscal year. “Project planning and implementation should also be closely monitored to ensure effective budget spending,” said Poudel.
Meanwhile, the government’s total budget spending, including capital, financing and recurrent expenditure, during the review period stood at 25.81 per cent of the total budget of Rs 1.53 trillion for the ongoing fiscal.
The government has spent Rs 309.5 billion (32.35 per cent) as recurrent expenditure of the total allocated Rs 957 billion during the review period.

ALAS Group, a company based in Denmark, has expressed an interest to establish Approved Training Organisation (ATO) — an aviation training centre — in the country.
While the government recently announced its plan to establish its own flying school, the ALAS Group has come up with its concept of establishing ATO in Nepal, focusing primarily on pilot and cabin crew training.
The company recently held a discussion with the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) and the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) for the aforementioned purpose, informed Nabin Shrestha, the Nepal-based manager of the company.
“We shared our concept with the government in an informal meeting,” he said, “Hopefully we will be holding a formal meeting very soon.”
Both the MoCTCA and CAAN have given a positive response towards the project, he added.
Meanwhile, Dustin Paul Wilden, chairman of ALAS Group, said that the plan hinges on the company receiving approval from the concerned authorities.
As per him, the company has a plan of investing double-digit million dollars for the project. “However, it depends on the requirements of CAAN,” Wilden said.
“We have to hold a formal meeting with CAAN regarding the requirements that we need to fulfil before we can be certain on how much we will be investing,” he added.
According to him, the ATO will provide training not only to Nepali students but also to students from other South Asian countries.
“As the global aviation industry is growing rapidly and Nepal is still in the initial phase of aviation development, this is a good opportunity for us to expand our business,” he said, adding, “And surely it will help Nepal to produce skilled aviation human resources locally at low cost.”
As per Wilden, the ATO will provide both theoretical and practical trainings to the students.
It has to be noted that prior to this, a pilot training centre in Nepal had shuttered as it could not provide practical training.
“We have our own aircraft and regional airports are being constructed in the country. Thus, there won’t be any issue for ATO operation,” Wilden said.
“However, the government has to support us at the policy level.”

Higher inflow of remittance has made Nepalis lazy, as people have cut down working hours, hitting labour supply and revenue of non-farm enterprises. These are the findings of a latest report prepared by the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAW- TEE), a think-tank.
The report, which dissected data of the Nepal Living Standards Survey 2010-11, has found that Nepalis, who receive money from family members working abroad, work 2.4 hours less per week on an average.
This reduction in labour supply indicates a jump in, what the report calls, ‘reservation wage’ — the lowest rate at which job-seekers accept a job. Since wage expectation of workers is higher than what the market is offering, beneficiaries of remittance are inclined towards working less as the money they receive from abroad is providing them with a cushion.
This has created a disincentive to work in general, says the working paper, ‘Remittances and Non-Farm Self-Employment among the Left-Behind: Evidence from Nepal’.
Nepalis received Rs 879.3 billion in remittances from the formal channel in the last fiscal year. This amount is 26.2 per cent as a share of gross domestic product. This has made remittance the biggest foreign currency earner for Nepal. A surge in remittance inflow has reduced poverty in Nepal, improved living standard and enhanced household spending. But as households’ financial health is getting better, the nation may be falling ill as people have started working less.
Economically active Nepalis, on an average, work 40 hours a week, which includes time spent on extended economic activities, such as household chores. The average working hours are the highest in salaried employment (42), followed by non-farm self-employment (39), farm self-employment (23) and extended economic activities (18).
But in households where remittance inflow has doubled, women’s working hours in non-farm self-employment has fallen by 3.6 hours a week on an average, says the SAW- TEE report. Higher inflow of remittances has also propelled women to work 1.6 hours less on an average per week in agricultural self-employment and 3.4 hours less in wage employment.
These women, who have cut down labour hours in core economic activities, are devoting more time to household chores, such as firewood collection and fetching water.
Despite this, their total working hours have not gone up, says the report.
This means extra time spent on household chores did not make up for reduced labour hours in core economic activities, such as agriculture and non-agriculture wage jobs, and farm and non-farm self-employment.
But it is not only women who are cutting down on working hours because of comfort provided by higher remittance inflow. Men are also making less contribution to core economic activities, says the report.
This, in turn, has hit the income of enterprises. Enterprises operated by households, that witnessed 10 per cent jump in remittances, reported 0.5 per cent decline in the gross revenue on an average, says the report.
This shows remittances, which were supposed to raise access to finance and ease credit or liquidity constraints, are not working as incentives for beneficiaries to expand business, thereby hitting the process of creating additional employment opportunities. This implies the gap in the labour market created by Nepalis, who have left for overseas job destinations, has not been fulfilled.
If this continues, Nepal may not be able to promote entrepreneurship to ramp up domestic production.
Most of the enterprises operated by beneficiaries of remittances are generally micro in nature with low returns and are operating in the informal sector. Perhaps, operators of these businesses were reluctant entrepreneurs, who were pursuing their vocation out of desperation, says the report. So, had there been adequate supply of salaried jobs, these entrepreneurs would have opted for salaried jobs over self-employment, adds the report.
But what is also true is that salaried jobs are scarce in Nepal and that is one of the main reasons why people, mostly men, are seeking employment opportunities abroad.
“This calls for policy attention towards promoting non-farm micro and small enterprises,” says the report, adding, “Policymakers should create conditions that make nonfarm self-employment a vocation of entrepreneurs who are enthusiastic rather than reluctant.”
“For this, we must raise people’s access to domestic market, expand transport network, focus on providing market intelligence, provide vocational training and appraise whether money remittance beneficiaries are getting from their family members abroad is adequate to start or expand a business,” said SAWTEE’s Research Director Paras Kharel, who is also an author of the report.

Bhatbhateni Supermarket and Departmental Store, a reputed shopping chain, has been found to have evaded income tax and value added tax worth Rs 724.04 million since 2007.
Hearing the case filed by different firms against the decision of the Revenue Tribunal that they should pay the determined tax amount, a division bench of Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher JB Rana and Justice Prakash Kumar Dhungana on Monday concluded that five firms, including Bhatbhateni Supermarket, had evaded taxes and directed the government to initiate legal proceedings for tax collection from the companies.
The other companies against which the SC made the decision in cases of tax evasion include Arun Intercontinental, AIT Pvt Ltd, Shankar Oxygen Gas and BS Baniya Store and Firm. The apex court had decided that companies had evaded income tax and value added tax.
As per the SC decision, the five companies have evaded tax worth Rs 787.32 million. Bhatbhateni evaded income tax worth Rs 485.56 million and VAT worth Rs 238.48 million. Arun Intercontinental dodged income tax worth 20.08 million and VAT worth Rs 4.75 million. AIT evaded VAT worth Rs 24.18 million. Shankar Oxygen Gas is liable to pay income tax worth Rs 12.91 million and VAT worth Rs 1.06 million and BS Baniya Store and Firm evaded income tax worth Rs 208,427 and VAT worth Rs 115,096.
The SC had rejected the claims made by the defendants that they did not use fake VAT bills or evade income tax.
Bhadrakali Pokharel, spokesperson for SC, confirmed that the apex court had ordered the aforementioned companies to pay the income tax, VAT, as well as fines and interest.
“The responsible government agencies will now have to determine the fines and interests on the tax amounts and adopt legal ways of collecting the total amount from these companies,” Pokharel said.
She added that it would take a few days before the Supreme Court would issue the full text of the final verdict.
In February 2011, the Inland Revenue Department had raided Bhatbhateni Supermarket and found that it had been evading taxes by presenting fake VAT bills. After reviewing the documents from 2007 to 2013, the department had said that the store was liable to pay a total of Rs 724.04 million, excluding interest and penalty, to the government in back taxes.
Similarly, the department had raided the office of AIT Pvt Ltd in December 2009 and found that the company had been conducting transactions with fake VAT bills.
Binod Bahadur Kunwar, director general of IRD, said the department would take necessary action to collect the income tax and VAT from the companies after they received the full text of the final verdict from the SC.
Based on the information many companies had been increasingly issuing fake VAT bills, the IRD had formed a committee led by the then deputy director general of IRD Laxman Aryal on 23 December 2009. The committee had found that 518 companies, including the aforementioned firms, had evaded income tax worth Rs 3.33 billion, VAT worth Rs 3.7 billion and Rs 20.50 million in excise between 2007 and 2013. The cases of the remaining companies are sub-judice.

The programme was organised on August 16 and 17 at Kanjirowa National Secondary School in collaboration with Robotics Association of Nepal (RAN) and Nepal Robotics Project, USA, according to a press release issued by the organiser.

The main aim of the training was to promote STEM — focusing on both the practical and theoretical aspects of robotics in Nepal, reads the statement. As many as 28 participants from 18 schools were involved in learning about the fundamentals of STEM education, drone making, aerodynamics, principles of flying, among others.
Kapil Dev Regmi, Chairman of Kanjirowa School, highlighted that Nepal’s education system required a practical approach to encourage the students for innovation and research rather than promoting rote learning. He was hopeful that such training will be given priority in more schools in future.
Participating teachers had an opportunity to interact with one another and share their experiences on the condition of STEM education in Nepal. The programme was led by some innovative engineers having extensive knowledge of robotics and latest technological advancements in the field.
Michael Kronmiller from Nepal Robotics Project, US, Aliyah Pandoliff from Kashmir World Foundation, US, and Prof Sandra Magnus, former NASA Scientist and Astronaut sent messages for the success of the programme and expressed their interests to work further with Kanjirowa in STEM education in the future too.
Theodore Kronmiller, former US ambassador has been an inspiration to Kanjirowa in its STEM education, according to the statement.

Nepali students, who wish to pursue non-academic courses, like vocational education or language courses in countries such as Australia and Japan, will not be allowed to do so from now onwards, thanks to the government’s radical move aimed at curtailing the rights of high school graduates to make choices. What’s more, students who have not completed Grade XII will not be allowed to study abroad.
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology published a notice today stating that students who have completed Grade XII or equivalent will be given ‘no objection letters’ to study abroad only if they intend to pursue academic courses of bachelor’s level or above.
Students cannot study abroad without obtaining ‘no objection letters’. These letters are also essential to get foreign currency exchange facility.

“We will issue no objection letters even to those who wish to pursue technical and vocational education, language courses and academic bridge courses, which are similar to language courses. But those students will have to provide evidence to substantiate they will get enrolled in a university to pursue academic courses after completing vocational or language courses,” said MoEST Under-secretary Maheshwor Sharma.
This move will largely affect students intending to study in Australia. Many Australia-bound Nepali students join technical and vocational institutions. This is common among those pursuing nursing.
Technical and vocational education, which is a non-academic course, generally prepares students for the job market, as it is designed by conducting studies on the needs of several industries. Countries such as Australia, Germany and Switzerland are well known for their technical and vocational education courses.
The latest move will also hit students who leave for Japan to pursue language courses. Many of them have not even passed Grade XII.
The latest provision introduced by the government clearly states that students will not be given permission to study abroad if they have not completed Grade XII. At present, not many students prefer to study abroad before passing Grade XII, but the new provision prevents parents who can afford to, or students who wish to, from doing so.
“The new provisions were introduced on the basis of the law which states that students can only get enrolled in foreign institutions if they intend to pursue higher education,” said Sharma. He added, “We now define higher education as tertiary education and not education attained in Grade XI and XII.” Earlier, the government used to define education provided in grades XI and XII as higher education. This has changed after the government started recognising grades XI and XII as a part of high school.
“The government should not have introduced such a provision without holding consultation with stakeholders. This blanket provision will not do good to students planning to study abroad. Students should be allowed to go abroad if they can attain quality education,” said Kedar Bhakta Mathema, former vice-chancellor of Tribhuvan University.

Loughlin, who starred in the television sitcom “Full House,” and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli filed papers in federal court in Boston waiving their personal appearances at an arraignment hearing and asking to have not guilty pleas entered on their behalf.
They are among 50 people accused of participating in a massive scheme that allowed wealthy parents to use cheating and $25 million in bribes to help their children secure spots at well-known universities like Yale, Georgetown and USC.
California college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer pleaded guilty in March to charges that helped parents facilitate cheating on college entrance exams and bribed coaches at universities to falsely present their children as athletic recruits.
Prosecutors allege that Loughlin (54) and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USC’s crew team, even though they did not row competitively, to help them gain admission.
Loughlin and Giannulli provided Singer photographs of their daughters in order to create fake athletic profiles for them, which a USC athletics official in exchange for bribes then used to support recruiting them, prosecutors said.
The couple and several other parents were originally charged in March with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Prosecutors secured an indictment on April 9 that included an additional charge of conspiring to commit money laundering.
Several other parents charged alongside Loughlin and Giannulli also filed papers seeking to waive appearing at an arraignment and have not guilty pleas entered for them. A federal magistrate judge granted their requests on Monday.
In all, 33 parents have been charged in the college admissions scandal. Of those, 13 have agreed to plead guilty, including “Desperate Housewives” TV star Felicity Huffman. She is scheduled to plead guilty on May 21.

ULYSSES, KANSAS: A 16-year-old Kansas boy will soon earn his high school diploma — and a few days later he’ll travel to Harvard to collect his bachelor’s degree.
Ulysses High School senior Braxton Moral will attend both commencement ceremonies in May, becoming the only student to successfully pursue a four-year high school degree and a bachelor’s degree from Harvard at the same time, The Hutchinson News reported .
Harvard has changed the rules, Braxton’s father Carlos Moral said, so his son will “the one and only” reaching that milestone. Braxton Moral will be 17 when he gets his diplomas.
Carlos Moral said they began to realize their son was special when he was in the third grade.
“They told us: ‘You need to do something. He’s not just gifted. He’s really, really gifted,’” he said.
Braxton Moral skipped the fourth grade.
The Ulysses school district allowed him to take some high school classes while he was still in middle school. Before high school he took a class offered at Fort Hays State University. Then he was admitted into Harvard.
Braxton Moral simultaneously studied at the high school and the Harvard Extension School. The program typically serves adults who work and can’t attend classes on campus full time.
Ulysses High School math teacher Patsy Love served as the proctor for the Harvard program, administering Moral’s tests in Kansas. Moral spent the summer before his junior year at Harvard’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
“We constantly are monitoring Braxton to make sure he is not too overwhelmed,” said Julie Moral, Braxton Moral’s mother. “No achievement is worth him being unhappy.”
Braxton Moral is on track to graduate from the Bachelor of Liberal Arts program, with a major government and a minor in English, said Harry Pierre, associate director of communications for Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education.
Braxton Moral said he hopes to attend Harvard Law School next.
“Politics is end game for me,” he said, though he’s still too young to vote.

BOSTON: The latest crop of US Rhodes scholars has more women than any other single class, and almost half of this year’s recipients of the prestigious scholarship to Oxford University in England are either immigrants or first-generation Americans, the Rhodes Trust announced Sunday.
Among the 32 winners is Harvard University senior Jin Park, the first recipient covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation.
Park, 22, of the New York City borough of Queens, arrived from South Korea with his parents when he was 7, studied molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, and founded a nonprofit to help undocumented students apply to college.
He hopes to become an immigrant advocate, saying it’s important for him to use the opportunity to better others, not just himself.
“When you grow up as an undocumented immigrant in America, that understanding that your talents don’t really belong to you in the traditional sense, that you have to share the fruits of your labor with others, that’s just something you learn,” Park said.
Alaleh Azhir, a 21-year old senior at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, emigrated from Iran when she was 14 — and is also one of 21 female scholars named Sunday. The New York City resident hopes eventually to become a doctor and will study women’s and reproductive health at Oxford.
“I’m just a passionate advocate for women in general and that’s mostly because of my background,” she said. “I thought that the way I could advocate for women could be by advocating for their health.”
At Chapman University in Southern California, Vidal Arroyo, 21, reflected on his unlikely path to becoming his school’s first Rhodes Scholar.
“As a Latino, a first-generation college student, and a train commuter to college, winning this scholarship means so much to me because it sheds hope for students from backgrounds like my own who have to overcome multiple barriers in pursuit of a higher education and a better future,” said Arroyo, who plans to study engineering science at Oxford.
And Eren Orbey, a 23-year-old senior at Yale University in Connecticut, whose parents emigrated from Turkey, hopes studying at Oxford will bring greater “context and clarity” to his writing. He is a regular contributor to The New Yorker magazine and is working on a book about his father, who was slain in Ankara when he was just 3, and the killer.
“I’m interested in studying the ethics of revenge and forgiveness,” Orbey said Sunday by email. “I think that our culture and media coverage often condescend to immigrants and survivors of trauma. In my writing, I hope to recast tragedy and strife as occasions for growth and heroism.”
The US Rhodes scholars join a separate, international group of scholars representing more than 60 countries.
Rhodes Scholarships provide all expenses for at least two years of study at Oxford. They were created in 1902 in the will of Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman and Oxford alum who was a prime minister of the Cape Colony in present-day South Africa.

LONDON: Football legend David Beckham has visited Indonesia – where one in three children have been physically attacked in school – to see how his charity, the 7 Fund, is combating bullying.
The A-list celebrity and former England captain launched the fund to protect the world’s most vulnerable youngsters in 2015 with the United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF).
“I feel very proud to see how my 7 Fund is helping UNICEF tackle bullying and violence in schools in Indonesia, and is ultimately keeping children, especially girls, safe in their schools so they can continue their education,” he said.
Bullying and violence are among the biggest worries for young people in Indonesia, with more than 1 in 5 teens aged 13 to 15 – or 18 million students – experiencing it, leading to mental health problems and school dropouts, UNICEF said.
The 7 Fund teaches children who have been bullied and former bullies to educate others and trains teachers to keep children safe. Bullying has been reduced by almost a third among the 7,000 children who have taken part in pilot programmes, it said.
“I spent time with an amazing young girl – Sripun – who was voted by her peers to take part in an anti-bullying programme to help stop violence in schools,” Beckham said in a statement.
“This has increased her confidence and she’s hopeful that other students won’t have to go through the same bullying experience she did.”
The fund — named after Beckham’s lucky number on his England and Manchester United shirts — focuses on children at risk of violence, abuse or disease.
Beckham, a father of four, has said that he hopes his own children will be proud of his work with the 7 Fund, which also has projects in Indonesia, Nepal, Uganda and El Salvador.

Vice-chairman of National Planning Commission Swarnim Wagle has said that setting the educational agenda has been a great challenge in the country.
Speaking at the 18th Annual General Meeting of Educational Journalist Group here today, he said the government had to give priority to education.
“The quality of education should be improved now that the local levels are responsible for handling and managing school education,” he said.
Around 40 per cent of budget is being sent to the local levels and preparations are also on to hand over different projects currently being handled by different non-governmental organisations to the local levels.
Similarly, former education minister Dhaniram Paudel said despite the handover of the education system to the local levels, the Ministry of Education, Department of Education and district education offices should handle the education system.
Madhu Prasad Regmi, secretary at the Ministry of Education, said 23 responsibilities of the education sector had been given to the local levels without hampering the educational system.
As all the basic and secondary schools are being handled by the local levels it will be easy to manage resources for the education sector from local resources, he added.
On the occasion, Mathura Yadav principal of Tribeni Primary School, Rupandehi, and Devi Khadka Pokhrel, member of School Management Committee of Kamala Secondary School, Sindhuli were honored at the programme.

Kathmandu
Teachers are guides for students providing students with valuable knowledge, which help students to excel in their studies as well as life in general. Teachers with decades of teaching experience in various colleges share important tips.

Study on a regular basis
Teachers suggest that students should give regular time to their studies. However, they say there is no fixed hours that they should set aside.
“Regular reading is a must,” says Bharat Kumar Bhattarai, who has 30 years of experience as a Nepali lecturer. He suggests students to prepare notes right from the beginning of the academic year and go through it regularly.
Saroj Pyakurel, Accounting lecturer in different colleges in Kathmandu, says that there is no fixed hours that students should give to their studies. However, according to Pya-kurel, who has 14 years of teaching experience, students should give as much time as they can daily, in which they would be able to understand the lessons taught every day. “Students themselves should decide how much time they should give regularly on a daily basis so they understand the lessons,” he suggests. He stresses that during holidays too, students should set aside at least three hours for revisions.
Educationist Prof Dr Bidya Nath Koirala says that the time students should give to their studies depends upon their nature. Some students learn fast and some slowly, so students themselves should find out how much time they should give to their studies according to their learning ability.

Tips for exam preparation
Educators suggest that students should go through all the topics of a subject in order to obtain good marks in exams.  Nepali lecturer Bhattarai suggests students to divide time according to the importance and marks of the topics. “For the exams you should not study selecting a few topics, but study all the topics in the text with the intention to understand each topic thoroughly.”
He says that students who select only few a topics to study for exams will not be able to do well. “Every topic in course is inter-related, and if students do not understand earlier topics, they will not be clear about the next chapter too,” he opines.
He also suggests students to prepare for exams by noting down important points of each chapter. Besides this, he says that students, who prepare notes from the beginning, will score good marks in exams as they will have already gained a deep knowledge of each chapter. However, he suggests avoiding using guides books and guess papers. “Students depending upon guide books and guess papers will ruin themselves,” he informs as “guide book writers are not responsible ones; they take it as a job and they are not responsible towards students’ progress.”

Be proactive
Students should not only depend upon the teachers’ notes but should also work on their own by studying reference materials, books from the library and doing online researches, as per the teachers.
“Teachers are limited within the circle of their knowledge and education, so students should also study and prepare from books by various writers. This will broaden their knowledge,” says Bhattarai.
Pyakurel also argues that students should not only depend upon their teachers and course books. “Students can benefit much from YouTube and Google as thousands of study materials are available there.”
He further says, “The mind is always motivated by desire, so students should also research on issues in which their interests lie.”

Questioning mind
Prof Dr Koirala says that raising questions is the most important feature of a learner. He says that students should always have questions in their mind and ask questions to themselves in order to learn. On any topic or issue, a student should ask questions: Why it is so? How did it happen? What is the mechanism behind it? How is it related with me? Raising such questions will make a student understand topics analytically, he says.

Clear vision
Sociology lecturer Uttam Prasad Devkota says that students should have a goal. Devkota has 13 years of experience in teaching.  “It is not that you study BBA because you completed your plus two level. Students should have a clear vision about their field of interest and about what they want to be in future,” points out Devkota. He adds that the students should not be limited to their course but should broaden their horizon by gaining knowledge on social, cultural, political and economic conditions of the country and people. Students should always notice what is happening in their society and country. This will make them explore the possibility of the current subject they are studying. They should not only prepare to get good results in exams but think of study and learning as a regular process, Devkota adds.

Kathmandu
Teej, one of the greatest festivals for Hindu women, is here. Students also celebrate this festival, and even if they don’t, they are affected by the festivities surrounding it as people from their friend circle or family members celebrate it. Sharing their views about this festival, they admit that the study environment college and homes is affected by the festival.
In celebratory mood
For most students the best aspect of this festival is that it strengthens the bond between female members in society as they meet and share their feelings with each other. They add that the singing, dancing and the celebration part of the festival is what they enjoy the most.
Nisha Khatiwada, a resident of Kapan and a Vth semester student of Bachelor of Public Health at the Karnali College of Health Sciences in Battisputali, says that it is fascinating to see women in red, dancing and singing folk songs on streets, going to temples in a holy and fasting mood.
Class environment
Rebecca Maghariya, a IVth year student of Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) at the Shanker Dev Campus in Putalisadak, says that as their college has no uniform, students come wearing red and green, or colourful kurta and also with mehendi on their hands two weeks prior to Teej. Maghariya is from Kailali and is currently residing in Thankot.
Maghariya’s classmate Pratiksha Gautam says Teej becomes a subject of all talks among classmates. Gautam hails from Rukum and is residing in Dillibazar. According to her, kind of clothes to wear and songs to sing during Teej become the main topics of talk in class starting a few weeks before the festival.
Effects on study
The students also admit they are distracted from their studies during the festival due to many reasons.
Neeru Poudel, a IVth Year BBS student at Shanker Dev Campus, says that the festival affected her when she was studying in BBS Ist Year as the board exam was on the same day. She was distracted from her studies as there was a celebratory environment at her home. According to her, this year too the BBS Ist Year board exams were scheduled on Teej but was postponed due to floods in Tarai. Poudel is from Syangja and residing in New Baneshwor. She says that music and other noise from Darr events at a nearby complex could be heard from her room. This disturbs her while doing her college assignments.
Umesh Bhakt Joshi, a IInd Year student of Bachelor of Law (LLB) at the Nepal Law Campus at Pradarshanimarg, says that around 50 per cent of female classmates in his class do not attend class from around two weeks prior to Teej. Joshi, from Bajhang and residing in Kirtipur, says almost all his female classmates are absent from Darr eating day till Rishi Panchami. He opines that as half the number of students remain absent, their lecturers show no interest in teaching and usually postpone classes for a week. There is also less possibility of female lecturers holding classes on those days, informs Joshi, adding that student unions in the college have organised Darr programme for students this year too as in previous years.
Shanta Bahadur Tamang of the Nepal Law Campus however, says that Teej celebration should not affect students regarding their studies as it depends upon students themselves on how to manage time. According to him, if some days are to be spent in celebrations, students should study those chapters early on or give extra time to the same after the festival ends.
Superstition
Apart from these aspects of Teej, Khatiwada said she does not believe bathing and performing other rituals on Rishi Panchami will purify women and earn them penance from the so-called mistakes they may have committed being and making others impure during periods. Such superstitions push women to an inferior position in society, she adds.

67,https://thehimalayantimes.com/education/the-hostel-life/,"Hasana Lawaju talks to college students who are living in hostels as they pursue their studies and finds out why students find it advantageous to stay in one


Hostel provides a good environment for studies — serious students take the best advantage while living in hostels. While there are the fun and challenges of living in a hostel, these are also the best places for students to live while pursuing their higher studies. Most students agree that they are motivated to study while saving their time as they attend their colleges while living in hostel.
Conducive study environment
Some students find hostel environment motivational to concentrate in their studies, especially during exams.  “Every student staying in a hostel usually has exams at the same time, and thus all are studying during that time,” says Bishwadeep Tamang, a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering, Bhaktapur. Tamang, who hails from Sankhuwasabha, is staying at Hostel Libali — a private hostel in Bhaktapur.
Tamang’s classmate as well as roommate Manish Dhakal echoes a similar view — “when a  friend is studying for exams at hostel, a competitive spirit develops among other friends, and as a result everyone is motivated to study”.
The motivation to study comes from seniors at her hostel for Manisha Khadka, Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) VIth Semester student.  Khadka, who studies at Padmakanya Multiple Campus, Baghbazar and stays in the college’s Pragya Chhatrawas, shares, “When I see my seniors — especially Master’s level students — studying sincerely, I am inspired to study properly.”
Living in a hostel with classmates becomes advantageous, especially when one misses a class or does not understand the topic taught in the classroom.  “Whenever I do not understand any topic taught by the teachers, I can consult my roommates or other friends in the hostel who have a better understanding of the topic,” points out Kshitij Dahal, BE (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering. Dahal also resides in Hostel Libali.
However, Sharmila Upadhyaya staying at Padma Girls Hostel in Pulchowk, has a different experience. Initially, when she started living in the hostel three-and-a-half years ago, it was difficult for her to adjust because she was not used to studying in group. But with time, she has gotten used to it.
Upadhyaya, BE (Computer Engineering) VIIIth Semester student at the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk,  shares her hostel offers a good environment for students as it “only selects students after checking their academic performances”.
Life made easier
Khadka’s hostel is next to her college premises. “It takes me only a few minutes to reach my hostel. So, my time is not wasted in travelling,” says Khadka, who hails from Butwal. Living near the college, she claims to utilise most of her time for studies.
Had Dhakal, whose house is in Kapan, chosen to commute to his college in Bhaktapur from his home “I would have spent at least four hours daily just travelling in bus”. Thanks to his decision to stay in a hostel, he is able to save valuable time.
The students also need not cook or do laundry and cleaning as most hostels provide students with food, laundry and other services.

“We do not need to cook, wash dishes or clothes, and it is convenient for us,” Tamang shares.
Along with that other facilities are available in the hostels. For instance, the three-and-a- half storey Pragya Chhatrawas has made one study hall available in each floor for students along with Wi-Fi facility, as per Geeta Tandukar, a third class officer at General Administration Division of the Padmakanya Multiple Campus.
Kutumba Boys Hostel, Jawalakhel receives students’ report cards from their respective colleges. “We wake the students up early in the morning, monitor their studies, talk to the parents if their children are not concentrating in their studies or have poor academic performances,” hostel coordinator Bandana Khatri reveals.
More than studies
Be it a hostel run by the college or a private one, most make students’ academics the priority. But they also provide opportunities for students to have fun. As such, the occasional celebrations in hostels are the best moments for students like Khadka. They celebrate Teachers’ Day where they offer treats to their teachers and also celebrate birthday of their hostel warden, as per Khadka.
Hostel wardens too support the students in such endeavours. Rakesh Machamasi, Warden of Hostel Libali informs, “We prepare delicacies like Dahi Chiura, Khir, Yomari et cetera  on different occasions for the hostel students and we all celebrate together. Our students find such celebrations interesting.”
Dissatisfaction 
Most students agree that hostels provide them with a good study environment. However, they have some dissatisfaction too, mostly about the food served.
“Sometimes, the food served by our hostel is not hygienic. At times I have found insects and hair in the food, though it does happen always,” complains Khadka.
Dahal has some objection with the meat-policy of his hostel. “Our hostel serves meat every Wednesday. But if I do not feel like eating on that day and want to have meat on some other day, that is not possible,” Dahal argues.
But Upadhyaya puts forth a different opinion. “It is not what we want to eat, but what is available. If we do not eat properly, no one in the hostel will convince us to eat. As such habits like not eating on time  can even affect our health. So, rather than complaining, we should learn to take care ourselves,” she opines.

68,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/parasite-wins-at-sag-awards-so-do-pitt-and-aniston/,"“Parasite” has officially infected Hollywood’s award season. Bong Joon Ho’s Korean class satire became the first foreign language film to take top honors from the Screen Actors Guild on Sunday, setting itself up as a legitimate best picture contender to the front-runner “1917” at next month’s Academy Awards.
The best ensemble win for “Parasite” came over the starry epics “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” and “The Irishman.” It was a surprise but only to a degree. “Parasite,” up for six Oscars including best picture, has emerged as perhaps the stiffest competition for Sam Mendes’ “1917,” which won at the highly predictive Producers Guild Awards on Saturday.

But “Parasite” was the clear crowd favorite Sunday at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, where even the cast’s appearance introducing the film drew a standing ovation. Yet until the SAG Awards, the many honors for “Parasite” have seldom included awards for its actors, none of whom were nominated for an Oscar.
“Although the title is ‘Parasite,’ I think the story is about coexistence and how we can all live together,” said Song Kang Ho, one of the film’s stars, through a translator.
Because actors make up the largest percentage of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, their picks are closely watched as an Academy Awards harbinger.
But the last two years, the SAG ensemble winner has not gone on to win best picture: “Black Panther” last year and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” in 2018. And this year’s front-runner, “1917,” more acclaimed for its technical acumen, wasn’t nominated by the screen actors.
If “Parasite” can pull off the upset at the Feb. 9 Oscars, it would be the first foreign language film to do so.
Before the win for “Parasite,” the SAG Awards were most notable as a reunion for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. They each took home awards and celebrated the other’s win.
Pitt is headed toward his first acting Academy Award for his supporting performance in “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” and he added to his front-runner status with a win from the actors’ guild. Along the way, his speeches have been full of one-liners and he didn’t disappoint Sunday. Pitt, who said he was nursing a flu, looked down at his award and said, “I’ve got to add this to my Tinder profile.”
He added: “Let’s be honest, it was a difficult part. A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn’t get on with his wife. It was a big stretch.” The audience laughed and clapped, including — as the cameras captured — Aniston, his ex-wife.
Aniston later won an award of her own for best female actor in a drama series for the Apple TV Plus show “The Morning Show.” “What!” she said upon reaching the stage. Aniston finished her speech with a shout-out to her “Murder Mystery” co-star Adam Sandler, whose performance in “Uncut Gems” has gone mostly unrewarded this season despite considerable acclaim.
“Your performance is extraordinary and your magic is real. I love you, buddy,” said Aniston.
Backstage, Pitt watched Aniston’s acceptance speech. After she got off stage, they warmly congratulated each other on their first individual SAG Awards.
Along with Pitt, all the Oscar favorites kept their momentum, including wins for Renee Zellweger (“Judy”), Joaquin Phoenix (“Joker”) and Laura Dern (“Marriage Story”).
As expected, Phoenix took best performance by a leading male actor. After individually praising each fellow nominee, Phoenix concluded with a nod to his Joker predecessor. “I’m standing here on the shoulders of my favorite actor, Heath Ledger,” said Phoenix.
Dern also further established herself as the best supporting actress favorite with a win from the actors guild. On her way to the stage, she hugged her father, Bruce Dern, part of the “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” ensemble.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge continued her awards sweep for “Fleabag,” a winner at the Emmys and the Golden Globes. Waller-Bridge added a SAG win for best female actor in a comedy series and took a moment to reflect on the show’s parade of accolades.
“This whole thing really has been a dream, and if I wake up tomorrow and discover it was just that, then thank you,” said Waller-Bridge. “It’s been the most beautiful dream.”
“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” also continued its streak, winning best comedy series ensemble for the second straight year, along with a win for Tony Shalhoub. But accepting the ensemble award, the show’s shocked Alex Borstein said she had voted for “Fleabag.”
“Honestly this makes no sense,’ said Borstein. “‘Fleabag’ is brilliant.’”
Robert De Niro was given the guild’s lifetime achievement award, an honor presented by Leonardo DiCaprio who, like De Niro, is a frequent leading man for Martin Scorsese. (The two co-star in Scorsese’s upcoming “Killers of the Flower Moon.”) A raucous standing ovation greeted the 76-year-old actor.
De Niro, a fiery critic of Donald Trump, referenced the president in his remarks.
“There’s right and there’s wrong. And there’s common sense and there’s abuse of power. As a citizen, I have as much right as anybody — an actor, an athlete, anybody else — to voice my opinion,” said De Niro. “And if I have a bigger voice because of my situation, I’m going to use it whenever I see a blatant abuse of power.”
“Game of Thrones” closed out its eight-season run with wins for Peter Dinklage for best male actor in a drama series and for best stunt ensemble work. “The Crown” took best ensemble in a drama series. And both “Fosse/Verdon” stars — Michelle Williams and Sam Rockwell — won for their performances in the miniseries.

Joaquin Phoenix, Renee Zellweger take lead acting prizes
Brad Pitt wins again
Apple TV+ notches win for Jennifer Aniston in ‘Morning Show’

LOS ANGELES: South Korean thriller “Parasite” was the upset winner at the Screen Actors Guild awards on Sunday, while Joaquin Phoenix and Renee Zellweger were named best actors, cementing their roles as frontrunners at the Oscars next month.

“Parasite,” the Korean language social satire about the wealth gap in South Korea, beat homegrown Hollywood movies with A-list casts “The Irishman” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” to take the top prize of best movie ensemble cast.
Winning the award, director Bong Joon Ho said it made him think that “maybe we haven’t created such a bad movie.”
“I am so honored to receive this award. I will never forget such a beautiful night,” he said through an interpreter.
The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, are closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actors form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Phoenix’s terrifying performance as a loner who finds fame through violence in “Joker” has swept awards season.
“I am standing on the shoulders of my favorite actor – Heath Ledger,” Phoenix said on Sunday, referring to the actor who won a posthumous Oscar in 2009 for his turn playing the comic book villain.
Zellweger, likewise, has picked up most of the prizes so far for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopic “Judy.”
Brad Pitt picked up another trophy for his supporting role as a charming stunt man in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” while Laura Dern was named best supporting actress for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Netflix domestic drama “Marriage Story.”
“It was a difficult part,” quipped Pitt of his role. “A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn’t get on with his wife. It was a big stretch,” he said to laughter, riffing on his own life as a twice-divorced Hollywood heartthrob.
DISAPPOINTING NIGHT FOR ‘IRISHMAN’
Sexual harassment drama “Bombshell” went into Sunday’s awards with a leading four nods but emerged empty-handed.
Martin Scorsese’s $170 million Netflix gangster movie “The Irishman” had another disappointing night, despite a cast that includes Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci.
Several of the contenders for best picture at the Oscars on Feb. 9 were not nominated for best movie cast ensemble at SAG.
Those left out include immersive World War One film “1917,” the big winner at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, as well as dark comic book story “Joker,” heart-wrenching divorce drama “Marriage Story,” and novel adaptation “Little Women.”
De Niro, whose lead performance in “The Irishman” has been snubbed by the Oscars, Golden Globes and SAG, was given a lifetime achievement award at the SAG dinner and used his speech to take a veiled shot at US President Donald Trump.
In television, Jennifer Aniston was an upset winner for her role as a TV anchor in “The Morning Show,” bringing the second award this year for the new Apple TV+ streaming service. Her co-star Billy Crudup won a Critics Choice award last week.
Aniston, in her first television role since the end of “Friends” 25 years ago, seemed visibly shocked.
“What?! Oh my gosh. This is so unbelievable,” she said.
Comedy “The Marvelous Mrs Maisel” and British royal drama “The Crown” took the prizes for their TV ensemble casts. But “Mrs Maisel” actress Alex Borstein said the comedy prize should have gone to quirky British comedy “Fleabag.”
Moments earlier, “Fleabag” creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge accepted the best television comedy actress statuette, capping a year of multiple awards for her and the show.
“This whole thing has been a dream and if I wake up tomorrow and find it’s been just that, thank you. It’s been the most beautiful dream,” Waller-Bridge said.

LOS ANGELES: Brad Pitt and Laura Dern took home prizes at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards on Sunday, as Hollywood’s awards season began to shape up ahead of the Oscars next month.

Pitt won for his supporting role as a charming stunt man in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” while Dern was named best supporting actress for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Netflix domestic drama “Marriage Story.” Both had also won Golden Globes earlier this month.
“It was a difficult part,” quipped Pitt.

Comedy “The Marvelous Mrs Maisel” took the top television prize for its ensemble cast, but “Mrs Maisel” actress Alex Borstein said the prize should have gone to quirky British comedy “Fleabag.”
“This makes no sense,” a shocked Borstein said. “This is a mistake, but thank you,” said lead actress Rachel Brosnahan.

“This whole thing has been a dream and if I wake up tomorrow and find it’s been just that, thank you. It’s been the most beautiful dream,” Waller-Bridge said.
The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, are closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actors form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Sexual harassment drama “Bombshell” went into Sunday’s awards with a leading four nods for its story of how misconduct allegations by women in 2016 led to the ouster of Fox News network founder Roger Ailes. Ailes denied the multiple accusations from female staffers and died a year later.
Charlize Theron, who underwent hours in make-up to transform her appearance for her role as former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, is one of the favorites for best actress.
However, Rene Zellweger has picked up most of the prizes so far for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopic “Judy.” A win at SAG later on Sunday after a Golden Globe earlier this month will further boost her chances for a second Oscar next month.
Joaquin Phoenix, who played a terrifying loner in “Joker” and Adam Driver, who played a divorced father in “Marriage Story” are competing for best actor, along with Leonardo DiCaprio for the nostalgic “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.”
Several of the contenders for best picture at the Oscars on Feb. 9 were not nominated for the top prize of best movie cast ensemble at SAG.

Awards pundits say the contest for SAG’s best movie cast is likely to come down to two star-laden films – Netflix gangster epic “The Irishman” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” the 1960s throwback celebrating the entertainment industry.
De Niro, whose lead performance in “The Irishman” has been snubbed by the Oscars, Golden Globes and SAG, is getting a lifetime achievement award at the SAG dinner.

71,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/1917-takes-top-honour-at-the-producers-guild-awards/,"LOS ANGELES: If the Producers Guild Awards are a true predictor of the Oscars’ best film category, then the World War I film “1917” is poised to come away with the top honour in a few weeks.
The Sam Mendes film won the award for theatrical motion picture at the untelevised ceremony Saturday night at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. Many in the crowd seemed stunned after Reese Witherspoon announced the winner of the Darryl F Zanuck Award, which has gone on to win the best picture Oscar 21 out of 30 times — including the past two years, with “Green Book” and “The Shape of Water.”

“This film was inspired by my grandfather, Alfred Mendes, and my hope was to honor his experience,” said Mendes, who co-produced and directed the project. He also said it was his first time attending the awards, and thanked the guild for recognizing his film.
“This was best experience of my professional life,” he added.
Released late last month, “1917” has made a splash during awards season, including another surprise victory in the best drama picture category at the Golden Globes.
At the PGA awards, the war film bested other contenders like “Ford v Ferrari,” “The Irishman,” “Jojo Rabbit,” “Joker,” “Knives Out,” “Little Women,” “Marriage Story,” “Parasite” and “Once Upon a Time in … Hollywood.” “1917” has now built strong momentum heading into the Academy Awards on Feb. 9.
In other categories, “Toy Story 4” took home the animation award, “Fleabag” won the episodic comedy television award and “Chernobyl” collected best limited series.
“Producing a movie takes a village,” said “Toy Story 4” co-producer Mark Nielsen, while fellow producer Jonas Rivera stood beside him.
Multiple special honors were given out throughout the evening for production work including to Octavia Spencer, Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos, “Friends” co-creator Martha Kauffman, the film “Bombshell,” and Plan B Entertainment’s Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner.
“When I started off as an actor, I wondered about producers, ‘What the (expletive) do they do?'” Pitt jokingly said after accepting the David O Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures. Plan B has been behind “Moonlight” and “12 Years a Slave.”
“I’m now painfully aware of what you do,” he said. “I commend you all. Our job as producers are protectors, stewards. … Stewards of the story and protectors of the storytellers. And I find that to be an awesome responsibility.”
Spencer received the Visionary Award, struggling to deliver her acceptance speech through tears. The actress who starred in “The Help” and “Hidden Figures” said acting was her backup plan to being a producer, which was “the dream” for her.
“As an actor, I learned that my job was to find the truth in every scene and bring humanity to the characters I portray,” said Spencer, who runs the production company Orit Entertainment with Brian Clisham. Their company has produced the Apple TV Plus drama series “Truth Be Told,” and Spencer is starring in and producing an upcoming Netflix limited series about Madam CJ Walker.
“Now as a producer, I understand that Brian and I must maintain that insight with the movie and television series we develop,” she continued. “We look forward to adding fresh perspectives from diverse storytellers who enlighten, uplift and most importantly entertain.”

Disney will still run them as separate studios within the company. But trade publication Variety reported that 20th Century Fox will become 20th Century Studios, while Fox Searchlight Pictures will be Searchlight Pictures. Variety said the studios’ logos are largely unchanged except for the removal of the Fox name.

Variety said the Fox name created brand confusion with Disney because Fox News and the Fox broadcast network are owned by Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corp, while the movie studios now belong to Disney.
The news outlet said a decision has yet to be made on Disney’s Fox television production businesses, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox 21 Television Studio.
Disney representatives did not return messages requesting comment.

73,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/eminem-drops-surprise-album-advocates-changes-to-gun-laws/,"Rapper Eminem once again dropped a surprise album, releasing “Music to Be Murdered By” on Friday — along with a video that calls for changes to gun laws.
The follow-up to 2018’s “Kamikaze” — also released without warning — was announced on Twitter just after midnight.
The Detroit rapper’s new music video for “Darkness,” one of the album’s 20 tracks, depicts a shooting at a concert. The lyrics and storyline of the video specifically allude to the 2017 mass shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead, making it the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. It closes with audio and video footage of news broadcasts from other recent mass shooting around the U.S. and an appeal to register to vote.
“When will this end? When enough people care,” reads the text at the end of the video. “Register to vote at vote.gov. Make your voice heard and help change gun laws in America.”
A link to the music video on Eminem’s website encourages viewers to contact or visit several gun violence prevention organizations, including Everytown for Gun Safety and Sandy Hook Promise.
The cover art features blood spatter and a bearded Eminem clad in a suit and fedora and holding a shovel. An alternate cover features the same splatter, with a now hatless Eminem holding both a hatchet and a gun to his head in an homage to Alfred Hitchcock’s 1958 album of the same name: “Inspired by the master, Uncle Alfred!” Eminem tweeted.
“Music to Be Murdered By” is Eminem’s 11th studio album, according to his website.
Among many collaborators, the album features Ed Sheeran, Skylar Grey, Anderson .Paak and Juice WRLD, the 21-year-old rapper who died in December.

“The idea is to create a truly global, action-packed spy series,” Amazon Studios chief Jennifer Salke said. “It’s a totally innovative, multifaceted international approach to storytelling, and we can’t wait to tell you more as it comes together.”
Local-language productions are being done in Italy and India, with another announced Tuesday in Mexico. Amazon called the US version the “mothership” of the project, with production set to begin this summer.
Film star Chopra Jonas was in the ABC TV series “Quantico.” Madden starred in the award-winning BBC and Netflix series “Bodyguard.”
The other “Citadel” productions will “enhance the experience of engaging with the show,” Salke said. Further details and release dates were not announced.
Also announced by the streaming service during its presentation at a TV critics meeting:
— Meagan Good is among the stars of an upcoming Amazon comedy from “Girls Trip” creator Tracy Oliver.
The untitled, half-hour series revolves around four African American college friends in pursuit of their dreams, the streaming service said.
Good (“Star,” “Think Like a Man”) plays the “stylish, sunny” Camille, who teaches an anthropology course on sex and love at Columbia University. Also starring are Grace Byers (“Empire”), Jerrie Johnson (“Good Trouble”) and Shoniqua Shandai (“I Am the Night”).
Byers plays trust-fund baby and fashion designer Quinn; Shandai portrays aspiring singer Angie and Johnson plays Tye, described as “an alpha fierce, queer successful app developer.”
The series reunites Oliver with “Girls Trip” director Malcolm D. Lee, who will direct the first two episodes. Pharrell Williams is joining the show’s executive producers, which include Oliver and Amy Poehler,
— Amazon is touting the cast of a new “The Lord of the Rings” series as multi-generational actors “from around the globe,” including British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi and Australian actor-musician Tom Budge.
But the streaming service declined to say which characters — or the races — they or other cast members announced Tuesday will be playing. Other details of the production also are being kept under wraps but “everything is moving forward,” Salke said.
The series will “explore new storylines” preceding J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Fellowship of the Ring,” Amazon said.
Other actors in the series based on Tolkien’s works include Joseph Mawle, who played Benjen Stark on “Game of Thrones,” Morfydd Clark (“His Dark Materials”) and Ismael Cruz Cordova (“Ray Donovan,” Mary Queen of Scots”).

75,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/riding-globes-1917-ends-star-wars-box-office-reign/,"LOS ANGELES: It took the Great War to finally take down “Star Wars.”
Director Sam Mendes’ World War I story “1917” brought in $36.5 million in its first weekend of wide release, easily topping the box office and ending the three-week reign of “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” which brought in $15 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.

Universal’s expansion strategy worked beautifully for “1917,” as the film went from just 11 screens in its first two weeks to more than 3,400 on the weekend after it won Golden Globes for best director and best drama film, and just before Monday’s Academy Award nominations, where it’s likely to get nods in several categories.
“This is the blueprint for how to perfectly execute the platform release for a potential Oscar nominee and Oscar winner,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore.
While the epic wartime feel of “1917,” which was shot and edited to appear as though it was done in a single take, makes it a natural for major awards, its triumphs at the Golden Globes were a surprise over other dramas including “The Irishman” and “Marriage Story.”
“I hope this means that people will turn up and see this on the big screen, the way it was intended,” Mendes said at the Globes ceremony. Those hopes weren’t unfounded.
A good weekend was expected for the film, but it shot past those expectations.
“It’s the not like the kids were clamoring for a World War I trench drama,” Dergarabedian said. “A film like this could have easily slipped off the radar.”
With its previous two-week take, “1917” has now earned $39.2 million in the U.S. and Canada and over $60 million globally. That’s of course dwarfed by Disney’s total domestic take of $478.2 million for “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” which is on the verge of reaching $1 billion globally after four weeks.
“Jumanji: The Next Level” was in third place in its fifth week of release for Sony with earnings of $14 million, and has totaled more than $257 million domestically.
Sony has a smaller sort of hit in “Little Women,” which could also make a mark at Monday’s Oscar nominations and continues its strong run for a film of its kind, bringing in another $7.65 million to put it in the sixth spot with a total of $74 million after three weeks.
The usual January box-office blahs were in effect for the week’s new releases.
“Like a Boss,” Paramount’s comedy starring Tiffany Haddish and Rose Byrne, finished in a fourth-place tie at $10 million with “Just Mercy.”
“Underwater,” 20th Century Fox’s deep-sea adventure starring Kristen Stewart, brought in a tepid $7 million and finished below “Little Women.”
“For newcomers, this is usually not a bountiful time for the box office,” Dergarabedian said. “It’s usually about the holdovers and awards-season contenders.”
The tied-for-fourth $10 million finish was better news for Warner Bros.’ smaller-budgeted “Just Mercy,” which stars Michael B. Jordan in the true story of an attorney appealing a murder conviction, and like “1917” was expanded from just a few screens to a few thousand in its third weekend.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

“1917,” $36.5 million, ($19.9 million international).
“Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker,” $15.1 million, ($24.2 million international).
“Jumanji: The Next Level,” $14 million, ($22.6 million international).
“Like a Boss,” $10 million.
“Just Mercy,” $10 million.
“Little Women,” $7.65 million, ($8.1 million international).
“Underwater,” $7 million, ($7.1 million international).
“Frozen 2,” $5.76 million, ($19.1 million international).
“Knives Out,” $5.73 million, ($5.5 million international).
“Spies in Disguise,” $5.1 million, ($11.4 million international).

NEW YORK: Canadian pop superstar Justin Bieber revealed on Wednesday that he had been battling Lyme disease and a serious case of mononucleosis but said he was overcoming his health issues.
On Instagram, Bieber noted that some people had recently criticized his appearance and suggested he was using drugs.
“They failed to realize I’ve been recently diagnosed with Lyme disease, not only that but had a serious case of chronic mono which affected my skin, brain function, energy and overall health,” Bieber wrote.
“It’s been a rough couple of years but getting the right treatment that will help treat this so far incurable disease,” he added. “And I will be back and better than ever.”
Bieber, 25, said his health challenges were among the topics to be chronicled on an upcoming 10-episode documentary series about his life that will be released on YouTube starting on Jan. 27.
In the past year, Bieber has written a series of Instagram posts to his 124 million followers talking about his struggles with depression, drug abuse and fame and crediting religion and wife Hailey Baldwin for his recovery.
This year, Bieber plans to release his first album in several years and embark on a North American tour. He released a single called “Yummy” last week.

The ruling by Rio de Janeiro judge Benedicto Abicair responded to a petition by a Brazilian Catholic organization that argued the “honor of millions of Catholics” was hurt by the airing of “The First Temptation of Christ.” The special was produced by the Rio-based film company Porta dos Fundos, whose headquarters was targeted in the Christmas Eve attack.
Netflix told The Associated Press it would not comment on the ruling.
Porta dos Fundos also declined to comment on the judge’s decision, which contradicted an earlier decision rejecting censorship of the program. The ruling is valid until another court orders otherwise.
Abicair said the program’s withdrawal “is beneficial not only to the Christian community, but to Brazilian society which is mostly Christian.”
The ruling comes at a time when some civil groups say far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is waging a “cultural war,” cutting funding for arts projects that challenge “Christian values” and inveighing against flamboyant carnival celebrations.
Early on the day before Christmas, a group of hooded men attacked the headquarters of Porta dos Fundos with Molotov cocktails. No one was hurt. A video circulating days later on social media showed three men claiming responsibility for the attack.
The First Temptation of Christ depicts Jesus returning home on his 30th birthday and insinuates he is gay. Religious groups bristled at the depiction. Creators of the film have defended it as legitimate freedom of expression.

Deepika Padukone stood silently behind students chanting anti-government slogans at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University on Tuesday evening, surprising many in a country where top film stars typically avoid politics.
Her act of solidarity came after masked men wielding sticks and rods stormed the JNU campus on Sunday, injuring some 30 people.
Students at JNU, regarded as a left-wing bastion, have protested for months against an announced fee hike as well as a new citizenship law, which critics say discriminates against Muslims and erodes India‘s secular constitution.
Students and some faculty blamed Sunday’s assault on a student union with ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. The student union has denied these allegations, blaming left-wing groups for the violence.
Pictures circulating online showing a solemn-faced Padukone standing behind an injured student leader, whose head was covered in a bandage, set off social media storm, raising calls for a boycott of her film “Chhapaak” (Splash), which is set to be released on Friday.
“#BoycottChhapaak” was Twitter’s top trending topic in India on Wednesday, with more than 350,000 tweets on the subject. The film is based on the true story of a woman who survived an acid attack and re-built her life.
“What a brazen & cheap tactic to promote a film!” wrote one Twitter user about Padukone.
“She chooses JNU where leftists who want to break India dominate!” tweeted another.
Some outspoken Bollywood figures lauded Padukone though, and vowed to support “Chhapaak.”
“Let’s all those who stand against the violence go to @bookmyshow and show them,” tweeted director Anurag Kashyap.
Padukone, who starred in the 2017 action film “xXx: Return of Xander Cage” with Vin Diesel, does not appear to have made any statement on Tuesday. She was not available for comment on Wednesday, her spokeswoman said.
The protests sweeping India in the last weeks have posed a dilemma for Bollywood, which has some big-name Muslim actors but is sensitive to the sentiments of the country’s Hindu majority.
“The reason why a whole lot of stars back away from making statements is because they are afraid of the consequences it will have on their films,” said brand consultant and columnist Santosh Desai. “To do this so close to a film is certainly risky.”

79,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/celebs-donate-millions-to-help-australia-wildfire-efforts/,"LOS ANGELES: Elton John and Chris Hemsworth are among the celebrities donating big bucks for relief efforts as wildfires engulf Australia.
Hemsworth, the Australian actor who plays Thor in the Marvel movie franchise, took to social media Monday to share that he will donate $1 million and asked his millions of followers to show support as well. He said that “every penny counts.”
So far, the wildfires have scorched an area twice the size of the U.S. state of Maryland. The blazes have killed 25 people and destroyed 2,000 homes. The fires, fueled by drought and the country’s hottest and driest year on record, have been raging since September, months earlier than is typical for Australia’s annual wildfire season.
John announced during his Farewell Yellow Brick Road concert in Sydney, Australia, that he will also donate $1 million. The singer said he wanted to bring attention to the devastation that wildfires have caused, saying it has reached a “biblical scale.”
Hemsworth and John join a growing list of celebrities who have pledged to donate toward relief efforts, including Nicole Kidman, Pink and Keith Urban.
“I am totally devastated watching what is happening in Australia right now with the horrific bushfires,” Pink wrote in a recent social media post. “I am pledging a donation of $500,000 directly to the local fire services that are battling so hard on the frontlines. My heart goes out to our friends and family in Oz.”
Metallica announced a donation on Tuesday night of $750,000 to a  firefighting agency  and  emergency services agency in Victoria.
An emotional Rose Byrne, who is Australian, spoke about the crisis and the relief efforts on Tuesday night at the New York premiere of her movie “Like a Boss.”
“Really what people need is just donations because it’s all volunteer based, the firefighters and all the rural services and the wildlife services trying to rescue the animals,” she told The Associated Press.
She added: “It’s devastating. It’s such a beautiful country. There’s always drought but this is the hottest year on record and they need rain but a lot of rain, not just a little bit which is what’s happening now. They need like a downpour, downpour and it’s just getting hotter and it’s getting more and more out of control. It’s a climate crisis is what it is.”
At the Golden Globes on Sunday, Phoebe Waller-Bridge said she would auction off her Globe outfit and have the proceeds go to firefighter relief.
Russell Crowe wasn’t at the Globes to accept his trophy for best actor in a limited series or TV movie for playing former Fox CEO Roger Ailes in the Showtime miniseries “The Loudest Voice.” Instead, the actor was in Australia trying to protect his home from the wildfires, sending a speech that Jennifer Aniston read.
“Make no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change-based,” Crowe’s statement said. “We need to act based on science, move our global workforce to renewable energy and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is. That way, we all have a future.”

BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA: Tom Hanks, regarded as one of the nicest men in show business, was honored with a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes on Sunday to mark his 30-year movie career.
The boyish-looking Hanks, now 63, was presented with the Cecil B DeMille award at a ceremony where he also was nominated in the best supporting actor race for his role as the late, beloved US children’s television presenter Mister Rogers in “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.”

Hanks began his acceptance speech by joking about his early career stint on the 1970s TV comedy “The Love Boat” and saying that he had a bad cold that had made him particularly emotional.
He thanked his wife, Rita Wilson, and five children before acknowledging a long list of actors and directors who he said had contributed to his long success.
“You’re a dope if you don’t steal from everybody you have every worked with,” Hanks said, naming Meryl Streep, Meg Ryan, Denzel Washington, and Charlize Theron, among others.
Hanks made his movie breakthrough in “Big” in 1988, playing a teenager who wakes up to find himself in the body of an adult.
He went on to win back-to-back Oscars and Golden Globes in 1994 and 1995 for his roles in AIDS drama “Philadelphia” and comedy “Forrest Gump.”
Genial and dependable, he has become known as “America’s Dad” thanks to performances in more than 70 movies, including romantic comedy “Sleepless in Seattle,” war movie “Saving Private Ryan,” action film “Sully” and the voice of friendly cowboy Woody in the “Toy Story” animated franchise.
Hanks attributed some of his success in the movies to a lesson he learned while working at a Shakespeare theater festival when he was a young actor: being on time.
“Showing up on time is one of the greatest liberating acts you can give yourself in a movie,” he said.
The Cecil B DeMille award is given annually by Golden Globe organizers the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to an actor, director or producer who has made a lasting impact on the film industry. Past recipients include Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep, Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Harrison Ford.

81,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/1917-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-win-golden-globes/,"
The 77th Golden Globes were meant to be a coronation for Netflix. Instead, a pair of big-screen epics took top honors Sunday, as Sam Mendes’ technically dazzling World War I tale “1917” won best picture, drama, and Quentin Tarantino’s radiant Los Angeles fable “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” won best film, comedy or musical.
The wins for “1917” were a surprise, besting such favorites as Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” (the leading nominee with six nods) and Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman.” Both are acclaimed Netflix releases but they collectively took home just one award, for Laura Dern’s supporting performance as a divorce attorney in “Marriage Story.” “The Irishman” was entirely shut out.

“1917” also won best director for Mendes. The film was made in long takes, giving the impression of it unfolding in one lengthy shot.
“Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” had easier path than the more competitive drama category. Brad Pitt won for best supporting actor, his first acting Globe since winning 1996 for “12 Monkeys,” padding his front-runner status for the Oscars.
“I wanted to bring my mom, but I couldn’t because any woman I stand next to they say I am dating so it’d just be awkward,” said Pitt.
Ricky Gervais, hosting the NBC-telecast ceremony for the fifth time, began the evening with an expletive-laden plea against hypocrisy, telling winners to stick to thanking their agent and their god. But throughout the night, those who took the stage used the moment to speak on matters including the currently raging Australian wildfires, destabilization in Iran, women’s rights, the importance of LGBT trailblazers, and even, the importance of being on time.
Gervais also argued that Netflix had taken over Hollywood, given the streaming service’s commanding 34 nominations, in film and TV, coming into the Globes. But the awards were widely spread around among traditional Hollywood studios, indie labels like A24, cable heavyweights like HBO and relative newcomers like Hulu.
As always at the Globes, there were surprises. Mendes’ best director ‘prize bested the likes of Martin Scorsese (“The Irishman”), Tarantino and Bong Joon Ho (“Parasite”). The award was well-timed for “1917,” which expands nationwide Friday.
“There is not one director in the world that is not in the shadow of Martin Scorsese,” a plainly surprised Mendes said.
Awkwafina, the star of the hit indie family drama “The Farewell,” became the first woman of Asian descent to win best actress in a comedy or musical. “If anything, if I fall upon hard times, I can sell this,” said Awkwafina, holding the award.
No other category has been more competitive this year than best actor. On Sunday, Joaquin Phoenix won for his loose-limbed performance in the divisive but hugely popular “Joker” in a category that included Adam Driver (“Marriage Story”)
Gervais opened the 77th Golden Globes by declaring movies irrelevant, pretending to confuse Joe Pesci for Baby Yoda, calling the Hollywood Foreign Press Association racist and declaring Netflix’s takeover of Hollywood complete.
Gervais, who has a series on Netflix, said he could summarize the three-hour award show with a simple phrase: “Well done, Netflix. You win.” The streaming giant came into the Globes with a commanding 34 nods: 17 in film categories and 17 in television categories.
Hosting the Globes for the fifth, and according to him last time, Gervais was perhaps even more cutting than before. He told executives in the room that journalist Ronan Farrow, who has exposed cases of sexual misconduct, was coming for them. He said something vulgar that got bleeped about Judi Dench’s part in “Cats.” And most of all, he mocked Hollywood hypocrisy, skewering stars for working for companies like Apple, Amazon and the Walt Disney Co. while giving speeches urging social change.
“If ISIS started a streaming service, you’d call your agent,” Gervais told the starry crowd Sunday at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California.
Laura Dern, the best supporting actress front-runner for her performance as a divorce attorney in “Marriage Story,” won her fifth Globe. (Dern even served as Miss Golden Globe at age 15.) Her win denied Jennifer Lopez, the “Hustlers” star, her first major acting award.
The first award of the night went to a streaming service series. Ramy Youssef won best actor in a TV series comedy or musical for his Hulu show “Ramy.” Best actor in a limited series went to Russell Crowe for the Showtime series “The Loudest Voice.” He wasn’t in attendance because of raging wildfires in his native Australia.
“Make no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate-changed based,” Crowe said in a statement read by presenters Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.
Ahead of Sunday’s show, some wondered how much the rising tensions with Iran would be talked about following the United States’ targeted killing on Friday of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. That went unmentioned until more than halfway through when Patricia Arquette, a winner for her performance in Hulu’s “The Act,” said history wouldn’t remember the day for the Globes but will see “a country on the brink of war.” She urged all to vote in November’s presidential election.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge followed up her Emmy haul by winning best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series. She thanked former President Barack Obama for putting “Fleabag” on his best-of-2019 list. With a grin, she added: “As some of you may know, he’s always been on mine.”
Waller-Bridge’s co-star Andrew Scott (of “hot priest” fame) missed out on the category’s supporting actor award, which Stellan Skarsgård took for HBO’s “Chernobyl.”
HBO was also triumphant in best TV drama, where the second season of “Succession” bested Netflix’s “The Crown” and Apple TV Plus’ first Globe nominee, “The Morning Show.” Brian Cox, the Rupert Murdoch-like patriarch of “Succession,” also won best actor in a drama series. “The Crown” took some hardware home, too, with Olivia Colman winning best actress in a drama series, a year after winning for her performance in “The Favourite.”
Best foreign language film went to Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite,” the Cannes Palme d’Or winning sensation from South Korea. Despite being an organization of foreign journalists, the HFPA doesn’t include foreign films in its top categories, thus ruling out “Parasite,” a likely best picture nominee at next month’s Oscars.
“Once you overcome the inch-tall-barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,” said Bong through a translator.
Tom Hanks, also a nominee for his supporting turn as Fred Rogers in “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” received the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award. The Carol Burnett Award, a similar honorary award given for television accomplishment, was given to Ellen DeGeneres. She was movingly introduced by Kate McKinnon who said DeGeneres’ example guided her in her own coming out.
“The only thing that made it less scary was seeing Ellen on TV,” said McKinnon.
Hanks’ speech had its own emotional moment. Just as he was beginning comments that would touch on the importance of actors being on time, Hanks caught sight of his wife and four children at a table near the stage and choked up.
“A man is blessed with the family’s sitting down front like that,” said Hanks.
Elton John and Bernie Taupin won the evening’s most heavyweight battle, besting Beyonce and Taylor Swift. Their “I’m Gonna Love Me Again” won best song. “It’s the first time I’ve ever won an award with him,” said Elton of his song-writing partner. “Ever.”
The Golden Globes, Hollywood’s most freewheeling televised award show, could be unusually influential this year. The roughly 90 voting members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association have traditionally had little in common with the nearly 9,000 industry professionals that make up the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The HFPA is known for calculatingly packing its show with as much star power as possible, occasionally rewarding even the likes of “The Tourist” and “Burlesque.”
Sunday’s show may have added to that history with an unexpected award for “Missing Link” for best animated feature film over films like “Toy Story 4” and “Lion King.” No one was more surprised than its director, Chris Butler. “I’m flabbergasted,” he said.
But the condensed time frame of this year’s award season (the Oscars are Feb. 9) brings the Globes and the Academy Awards closer. Balloting for Oscar nominations began Thursday. Voters were sure to be watching.
The dearth of nominations for female filmmakers stoked more backlash than anything else at this year’s Globes. Only men were nominated for best director (just five women have ever been nominated in the category), and none of the 10 films up for best picture was directed by a woman, either. Time’s Up, the activist group that debuted at the black-clad 2018 Globes, was highly critical of the HFPA for the omission, calling it “unacceptable.”
Last year’s telecast, hosted by Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh, held steady in TV ratings, averaging 18.6 million viewers.

BEVERLY HILLS: Classic Hollywood takes center stage at the Golden Globes on Sunday, kicking off an unusually crowded awards season where the top movie honors are wide open.
The awards, handed out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), have shown a knack for rewarding movies that go on to do well at the Oscars in February.

Netflix’s wrenching “Marriage Story” and costly gangster epic “The Irishman” lead a field of dramatic movie contenders for Golden Globes that feature some of the biggest names in Hollywood but few safe bets on the likely winners.
“The winners are not that predictable. There are four legitimate contenders for top movie drama,” said Matthew Belloni, editorial director of the Hollywood Reporter.
Immersive World War One movie “1917” and religious biography “The Two Popes” round out the movie drama contenders.
Also competing for awards are “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” stars Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and director Quentin Tarantino, along with “Hustlers” actress Jennifer Lopez, actors Tom Hanks for “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” and Eddie Murphy in comeback mode with comedy “Dolemite is My Name,” and “The Irishman” director Martin Scorsese and veterans Al Pacino and Joe Pesci.
With acerbic British comedian Ricky Gervais hosting for the first time in four years, anything could happen at the informal, often boozy dinner in Beverly Hills.
One of the closest contests is for best movie drama actor between publicity-averse stars Joaquin Phoenix and Adam Driver.
Phoenix’s terrifying “Joker” performance has made him a force to be reckoned with this year, while Driver’s heart-wrenching role as a father resisting divorce and its consequences follows acclaimed turns as villain Kylo Ren in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” and political tale “The Report.”
A win in the best movie drama or comedy/musical fields by Netflix would mark the biggest Hollywood breakthrough so far by streaming services that have revolutionized the entertainment industry. Netflix leads the pack with a total of 34 nominations across film and television.
One of the few actor shoo-ins on Sunday appears to be Renee Zellweger for her role as the legendary entertainer Judy Garland in “Judy.”
“She gave a universally admired performance, and the HFPA has a history of honoring her,” said Belloni
Lopez, who wowed audiences as a feisty pole dancer in “Hustlers,” which she also produced, appears to be the favorite for the supporting actress statuette, while Pitt is the presumed front-runner for his supporting role as a 1960s stunt man in the nostalgic “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” awards watchers say.
On the television side, Jennifer Aniston crowned her return to the small screen with an acting nomination for “The Morning Show,” one of the first offerings from Apple TV+. The show also is in the running for best TV drama series.
The Oscars take place this year on Feb. 9, three weeks earlier than usual, causing a traffic jam of award shows.
“Everything is crunched together. We are going to have award show after award show after award show, and it is exhausting for a lot of the people that are nominated,” said Belloni.

The actress and her musician husband, Benji Madden, on Friday announced the birth of a daughter they’ve named Raddix.
“We are so happy, blessed and grateful to begin this new decade by announcing the birth of our daughter,” Diaz wrote on Instagram. “She has instantly captured our hearts and completed our family.”
But don’t expect a photo of the baby. Diaz wrote that while she and Madden “are overjoyed to share this news” they “also feel a strong instinct to protect our little one’s privacy.” The Instagram post had no image attached.
“We won’t be posting pictures or sharing any more details, other than the fact that she is really really cute! Some would even say RAD,” Diaz wrote.
Diaz, whose films include “There’s Something About Mary” and “Bad Teacher,” married Madden, a member of the band Good Charlotte, in early 2015.
Both parents posted the identical message on Instagram. Representatives for both stars did not immediately respond to calls for comment.

84,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/study-finds-2019-was-a-banner-year-for-female-filmmakers/,"NEW YORK: Lulu Wang, Lorene Scafaria, Melina Matsoukas and Greta Gerwig led Hollywood to a record year for women in the director’s chair. In 2019, women directed more of the most popular movies than any year before.
Women directed 12 of 2019’s top 100-grossing films in 2019, according to a study released Thursday by USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. That percentage of female filmmakers, 10.6%, is greater than researchers have recorded before, suggesting that some measure of change is finally coming to a film industry where inequality behind the camera has remained stubbornly persistent.

It’s the most meaningful increase in several decades for female directors. Despite mounting outcry, the rate of female directors helming Hollywood’s top productions has long been largely stagnant. The previous high in USC’s annual study was 8%, in 2008. In 2018, only 4.5% of the year’s top films were directed by women.
“This is the first time we have seen a shift in hiring practices for female film directors in 13 years,” said Stacy L. Smith, one of the study’s authors. “One notable reason for this jump in 2019 was that Universal Pictures had five films with women directors at the helm in the top 100 movies. Yet there is still much more progress needed to reach parity for women behind the camera.”
The high-profile success of several films had already made 2019 a historic one for women. Those include Wang’s “The Farewell,” one of the year’s most popular indie releases, Scafaria’s acclaimed “Hustlers” ($105 million domestically), Matsoukas’ “Queen & Slim” ($40.7 million) and Gerwig’s “Little Women,” which last week opened strongly with $29 million in its first five days of release.
“Frozen II,” with $1.2 billion in worldwide ticket sales, is close to setting a new box-office record for a movie directed by a woman. Jennifer Lee, who co-directed the film, set the record with the first “Frozen” film. In 2018, Lee became the chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios.
Other notable films included Kasi Lemmons’ “Harriet,” Tina Gordon’s “Little” and Jill Culton’s “Abominable.”
USC researchers singled out Universal Pictures, which put forward a slate of films with 26% directed by women. Universal is the only major studio with a female studio chief, Donna Langley.
Netflix also fared well. While the streaming company’s films largely bypass theaters — leaving them outside the study’s parameters — 20% of Netflix’s 2019 movies were directed by women.
Paramount Pictures, however, hasn’t released a movie directed by a woman in the last five years.
Four women of color directed one of the top 100 movies in 2019, though the overall statistics for underrepresented directors dipped. Underrepresented filmmakers were behind 16.8% of films in 2019, a decline from last year’s 21.4%, a record.
“While 2019 is a banner year for women, we will not be able to say there is true change until all women have access and opportunity to work at this level,” said Smith.
Another study released Thursday by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University examined women in the top films as not just directors but writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers. Women accounted for 20% of all such roles in the year’s top films, up from 16% the year before.
But the San Diego State University study, the 22nd annual Celluloid Ceiling authored by Martha Lauzen, found less progress when the movies researched were expanded to the top 500 films. In that metric, Lauzen found women held steady at 23%.
“While the numbers moved in a positive direction this year, men continue to outnumber women 4 to 1 in key behind-the-scenes roles,” Lauzen said in a statement. “It’s odd to talk about reaching historic highs when women remain so far from parity.”
Despite gains, female filmmakers have been largely overlooked in this awards season. Sunday’s Golden Globes, presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, includes no women nominated for best director. None of the 10 films nominated for best picture were directed by women, either.
Rebecca Goldman, Time’s Up chief operating officer, earlier said those results were unacceptable.
“This year, there have been twice as many women-led features than ever, with more films by female directors on the way,” Goldman said. “Women — and especially women of color — continue to be pushed to the sidelines by a system that holds women back, onscreen and off.”

Justin Bieber is launching a docu-series about creating his new album on YouTube, the platform where the singer originally got his start in music over a decade ago.
YouTube announced Tuesday that “Justin Bieber: Seasons” will debut Jan. 27. The 10-episode series will follow the pop star while he records his first new album since 2015. Before releasing his debut song in 2009, Bieber gained popularity from posting his performances of cover songs on YouTube.
“When I was getting started, YouTube provided me a platform and a community where I could share music, experiences and moments with my fans,” Bieber said in a statement. “It feels great to partner with YouTube for this original documentary series. I want my fans to be part of this journey.”
Bieber, 25, will release a new song, “Yummy,” on Friday. His most recent album was “Purpose,” which features the hits “Sorry,” “Love Yourself,” “What Do You Mean?” and “Where Are U Now,” a collaboration with Diplo and Skrillex which won Bieber his first-ever Grammy Award.
YouTube says the series will “feature a behind-the-scenes look at Bieber’s private life, including never-before-seen footage of his wedding to Hailey Bieber and his day-to-day alongside those in his inner circle.” The series will also show Bieber reflecting “on the highs and lows of growing up in the public eye as he invites his fans on the journey leading up to the release of the highly-anticipated and most personal album of his career.”

86,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/sharon-stones-dating-profile-restored-after-being-blocked/,"LOS ANGELES: Sharon Stone can now return to mingling on Bumble without being kicked off the dating app.
A Bumble spokesperson said in a statement Monday that Stone’s profile has been restored after it was “mistakenly” blocked. The 61-year-old Golden Globe-winning actress said on Twitter the day before that Bumble closed her account and she asked, “Is being me exclusionary? Don’t shut me out the hive.”
Bumble apologized for the confusion but thought users could have viewed Stone’s profile as fake because there was no verification.
“Being the icon that she is, we can understand how so many of our users felt it was too good to be true once they noticed her profile wasn’t photo verified,” the statement said. “Photo verification is just one of the many ways to connect with confidence on Bumble.”
Bumble extended an offer to host Stone for a few hours of profile prep at their headquarters in Austin, Texas.

Stone is best known for starring in the 1992 drama “Basic Instinct” and the 1995 crime film “Casino.” She has been married twice, the first to producer Michael Greenburg and then journalist Phil Bronstein, who she divorced in 2004.
The actress’ rep didn’t immediately return an email message from The Associated Press.

87,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/skywalker-rises-again-little-women-go-big-at-box-office/,"LOS ANGELES: “Star Wars” was still rising in the last weekend of the year, while “Little Women” broke big at the box office.
“Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” brought in $72 million over the weekend to remain the top-earning film in North America by light-years, according to studio estimates Sunday.

In 10 days of release it has brought in $362.8 million for Disney, falling just short of the earnings of its predecessor, 2017’s “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” in a comparable span.
Helped by the Christmas holiday week, “Star Wars” had a smaller-than-average 59% drop-off in its second weekend after earning $175 million in its first.
“For a movie that opened that big, that is a modest drop,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “Movies that open this time of year, they usually have legs.”
Sony’s “Jumanji: The Next Level,” earned $35.3 million for second place and has tallied a total of $175.5 million through its third weekend of release.
Director Greta Gerwig’s re-imagining of the American literary classic “Little Women” had a $16.5-million weekend and a five-day total of $29 million since its Christmas opening, a major performance for a smaller-audience film with a budget dwarfed by the top two films.
The film, also a Sony release, starring Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Laura Dern, scored big with both audiences and critics and is gaining momentum as an awards-season favorite.
“With Greta Gerwig’s reputation as a filmmaker, a great cast and a perfect holiday release date, they’ve got quite a hit on the their hands,” Dergarabedian said.
“Uncut Gems,” an even smaller film that has also sparked awards-season buzz for Adam Sandler’s rare dramatic performance as a jeweler and gambling addict, entered the top 10 for the first time as it expanded to more screens in its first week. The film earned $9.6 million over the weekend and has brought in $20 million overall.
Director Sam Mendes’ experimental World War I epic “1917,” earned more than $1 million since its Christmas opening despite showing in only 11 theaters. The huge per-screen average bodes well for the film’s nationwide opening next month as it ramps up its Oscars campaign.
As 2019 ends, annual overall box office revenue is down by 4%, though it gained ground in its latter months, narrowing a deficit that was 11% in April, and 2018 was always going to be tough to beat.
“Last year was an outlier,” Dergarabedian said. “It was just a massive year.”
Between Marvel and “Star Wars,” and its animation divisions, 2019 was utterly owned by Disney, which had all five of the year’s top grossing movies: “Avengers: Endgame,” “The Lion King,” “Toy Story 4,” “Captain Marvel” and “Frozen 2.”
And with “The Rise of Skywalker” ending the year at No. 7 and “Aladdin” at No. 8, the mega-mouse ate up seven of the top 10 spots.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.
1. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” $72 million, ($94.3 million international).
2. “Jumanji: The Next Level,” $35.3 million ($61.6 million international).
3. “Little Women,” $16.5 million, ($6.3 million international).

NEW YORK: Lindsey Vonn popped the question to hockey star PK Subban.
“Merry Christmas and happy holidays everyone!! On our 2 year anniversary, in a “non traditional” move, I asked PK to marry me and he said, Yes,” Vonn tweeted on Christmas Day. “Yes (bashful emoji) ! Women aren’t the only ones who should get engagement rings!”
The former ski racer closed the tweet with the hashtags “MerryChristmas” and “equality.”
Vonn linked a picture of herself and Subban with the ring, with the couple wearing matching striped pajamas in front of a Christmas tree with three dogs in the foreground. She also posted a close-up of Subban flashing the ring, with the words “Drip drip”and a blue teardrop.
Vonn also said on social media in August that they were engaged.
The 35-year-old Vonn recently retired from a skiing career that included three Olympic medals, four overall World Cup titles and 82 World Cup race wins, a record for a woman.
The 30-year-old Subban and won the 2013 Norris Trophy with Montreal as the NHL’s top defenseman. He was traded to New Jersey from Nashville in June.
Vonn had a high-profile relationship with Tiger Woods. She previously was married to former ski racer Thomas Vonn, and kept his last name after they separated.

KATHMANDU: Nepal’s famous folk-rock band, Nepathya, performed at the Palms at Crown, entertainment venue, in Melbourne of Australia, on Monday.
The show kicked off with Nepathya’s popular number “Bheda ko Un Jasto” with a synchronised video and light at a sold-out auditorium.
While performing the song, the band’s lead singer Amrit Gurung paused and said, “Yesterday, we have lost one of our founding members—Suk Gurung–who gave us hit song ‘Chakyo Chakyo Deurali Danda,” and paid tribute to late Gurung from the stage.”
“May his soul rest in peace,” Amrit Gurung added.
As the show went on, the band performed their hit numbers–Taal Ko Pani, Yo Jindagini, Resham among others.
As usual, Gurung was supported by Dhurba Lama on drums, Suraj Thapa on keyboards, Subin Shakya on bass guitar, Niraj Gurung on guitars and Shanti Raymajhi on madal.
With this show, Nepathya’s concert entourage ends its Australia tour and heads back home on Tuesday.

90,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/disney-cuts-lesbian-kiss-from-star-wars-in-singapore/,"KUALA LUMPUR: Disney has cut a lesbian kiss from the latest “Star Wars” movie – one of the top Christmas films – Singapore’s media regulator said on Tuesday, so that more children can watch it.
The two minor female characters embrace but do not kiss in the version of “The Rise of Skywalker” shown in Singapore, local media said, as the ninth and final film in the celebrated science-fiction series rakes in millions from loyal fans.
“The applicant has omitted a brief scene which under the Film Classification Guidelines would require a higher rating,” a spokeswoman from Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Disney, which owns the “Star Wars” production company Lucasfilm, did not respond to a request for comment on its decision to cut the scene from the last installment of the second highest-grossing movie franchise of all time.
It concludes a story that began in 1977, when filmmaker George Lucas introduced a young hero named Luke Skywalker and delighted audiences with a galaxy of robots, furry warriors known as Wookiees and a host of other eclectic characters.
Sex between men is illegal in Singapore and punishable with up to two years in prison, though the British colonial-era law is rarely enforced. The law does not apply to sex between women.
Singapore activists challenged the law last month as polls suggested attitudes toward homosexuality are softening and similar legislation was scrapped in India last year.
The film is rated PG-13 in Singapore without the kiss scene, meaning parental guidance is advised for children below 13. Higher ratings mean it could be restricted only to viewers aged 16, 18 or 21 and above.
In 2016, the Singapore organisers of the musical “Les Miserables” removed a scene in which two male actors kiss after complaints from the public.
Disney declined to respond to a question about censorship in other markets, including the Middle East, amid media reports that lesbian kiss has also been deleted from screenings of “The Rise of Skywalker” in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

UNCASVILLE: Organizers wanted to make it clear the 99th Miss America competition isn’t your grandmother’s beauty pageant, and their winner did just that on Thursday.
Virginia biochemist Camille Schrier won the crown just minutes after wowing the crowd with science. Dressed in a lab coat, she gave a colorful chemistry demonstration of the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.
Schrier, a native of Pennsylvania, said she hopes to “break stereotypes about what it means to be a Miss America in 2020” by being a “woman of science” who is authentic to herself.
“I’m not the beauty queen,” she said. “I’m the brand ambassador for this organization and I’m more than just someone with a crown on my head.”
Victoria Hill of Georgia placed first runner-up.
No longer called contestants, the 51 women “candidates,” who hailed from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, competed for a $50,000 scholarship and the “job” of Miss America, a one-year paid position they hope to use as a public platform for their “social impact initiative.”
For the second year in a row, women were not judged in a swimsuit or how they look in an evening gown. Instead, a series of interviews and talent demonstrations will determine who is best qualified to wear this year’s crown.
“To make it relevant for these young women, it was important for us as a scholarship and service organization to make sure that we were reflective of this generation, meaning that you no longer had to be defined by some sort of ideal,” said Regina Hopper, president & CEO of the Miss America Organization.
Schrier, 24, who spoke on stage about having tackled an eating disorder, said she decided to compete for Miss America after the swimsuit competition was ditched, along with other changes that have been made to modernize the organization.
“I kind of figured that I would never get on that stage because I was a woman who did not want to get into a swimsuit on stage. And I didn’t have a performing talent, which is really ironic now,” she said, adding how she’s the first Miss America to win with a science experiment, a presentation she brings to schools.
Schrier is a cum laude graduate of Virginia Tech with dual bachelor of science degrees in bio chemistry and systems biology and she is currently studying to obtain a doctor of pharmacy degree.￼ Her platform issue is drug safety.
Morgan Nichols, Miss South Carolina, had her own message on Thursday night. She walked down the red carpet wearing a billowing, long skirt topped by a plain white T-shirt that read: “Stronger.”
While Hopper acknowledges there has been some push-back from “old pageant” people who liked the old way of doing things, she said there’s been greater interest in the competition since the roll-out of Miss America 2.0.
When asked on stage whether the Miss America organization should change even more and allow married women and women with children to participate, both Schrier and Hill said no. Schrier told reporters afterward that she believes the job would be too busy for a mother.
This year also marked the first time the multi-day event is being held at Mohegan Sun, a tribal casino and entertainment complex in suburban southeastern Connecticut. Miss America organizers announced plans this summer to leave Atlantic City, New Jersey — for the second time in its history.
Miss America also switched from ABC back to NBC to broadcast the glitzy finale to an estimated 4.5 million viewers. And for the first time, preliminary events and the finale — held in Mohegan’s 10,000-seat arena — are being streamed live on the NBC app.
“We’ve had many, many large events. This probably reaches the most people,” said Jeff Hamilton, president and general manager of Mohegan Sun. “We’re just really, really excited about it.”
Miss America organizers and NBC have not yet agreed to a multi-year contract with the Connecticut casino. A decision is expected in the coming months.
Schrier succeeds 2019 Miss America Nia Franklin, a classically trained opera singer from New York.
The decision to drop the swimsuit competition did create great controversy and criticism of Miss America officials, including former board chair and former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, who said in 2018 that Miss America would represent “a new generation of female leaders focused on scholarship, social impact, talent and empowerment.” Carlson has since stepped down.
Atlantic City businessmen came up with the idea for a pageant in 1921 as a way to extend the summer tourism season beyond Labor Day weekend. It became synonymous with the New Jersey seaside resort but moved to Las Vegas in 2005, returning to Atlantic City in 2013.

92,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/little-miss-period-tackles-japans-menstruation-taboos-with-a-punch/,"
TOKYO: Her timing can be terrible and she can pack a mean punch.
But “Little Miss Period” – a pink blob with red lips and red pants who stars in a Japanese manga comic and movie of the same name – has a mission: breaking taboos in a society where talking about menstruation has been seen dirty or embarrassing.

The character has generally been received positively as a step toward better understanding among the sexes. Some critics, though, worry about stereotypes and inattention to underlying gender discrimination that holds back Japanese women in many fields.
“Until now, menstruation has been something to hide and many people completely lack correct understanding of it,” said Kazue Muta, a sociology professor at Osaka University.
“I can’t praise the manga 100% … but it would be good if it were a step toward greater openness and education.”
The movie “Little Miss Period” was released domestically by entertainment company Yoshimoto Kogyo Co Ltd last month. It is based on a manga by male artist Ken Koyama that debuted in 2017 before being compiled into a book by publisher Kadokawa.
The film also opened in Taiwan this month and will debut in Hong Kong in January. Premieres in China and across Southeast Asia are also planned.
The topic of menstruation caught public attention in Japan recently when department store Daimaru suggested female employees wear a “period badge” to alert co-workers to their cycle. The plan sparked accusations of harassment and the store is reconsidering.
In the manga series, Little Miss Period – “Seiri-chan” in Japanese – delivers a punch to the gut that lays some women out flat before drawing blood with a syringe. When a woman’s husband fails to sympathise, he gets a “period punch” of his own to help him understand.
History gets a nod, with the tale of a feudal era Japanese girl forced to stay in a secluded hut because of the belief that menstruating females are unclean.
The movie version focuses on Aoko, a publishing firm editor whose male boss shows little compassion for her monthly pain. Aoko’s widower boyfriend is raising a young daughter. “If only men could get periods, even just once a year,” Aoko laments.
Feminist author Minori Kitahara welcomed efforts to break taboos but lamented that the representations were “treating the matter like a comedy talk show.”
Nobuyoshi Yoshida, 33, said he found the movie instructive. “Men don’t get how harsh menstruation can be for some women,” he said as he exited a cinema. “This was easy to understand.”
His girlfriend Kumiko Hanazawa, 32, was succinct: “I want men to watch this.”

93,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/anna-karina-the-icon-of-french-new-wave-cinema-dies-at-79/,"PARIS: Anna Karina, the French New Wave actress who became an icon of the cinema in the 1960s and was the muse of Jean-Luc Godard, has died. She was 79.
The French culture minister announced her death on Twitter on Sunday. French media said that the Danish-born Karina had cancer and died Saturday.

”Her look was the look of the New Wave. It will remain so forever,” Culture Minister Franck Riester tweeted.
“Anna Karina radiated. She magnetized the entire world,”‘ Riester said, adding that ”French cinema has lost one of its legends.”
Karina made seven films with Godard, her partner at the time, including the 1961 “Une Femme Est Une Femme” (A Woman is a Woman), in which she played a femme fatale. For that, she received the best actress award at the Berlin Film Festival. Other cult Godard movies starring Karina included the 1962 “Vivre Sa Vie'” (Live Your Life) and the 1965 “Pierrot Le Fou.”
Karina captured film-goers with her large blue doe eyes and acting and singing talents.
The French New Wave broke with traditional cinematic conventions to create a fresh approach to making movies, in keeping with the free-spirited times.
Godard wasn’t the only director with whom Karina worked. Jacques Rivette’s 1966 film “La Religieuse” (The Nun), adapted from the 18th-century French novel by Diderot, was initially banned. The story of a young woman forced into the convent by her mother, who had given birth out of wedlock, was revived in a restored version and presented at the 2018 Cannes film festival.
Born Hanne Karin Blarke Bayer in Denmark, she initially modelled and sang in cabarets before coming to France. She was reportedly discovered, and renamed, by Coco Chanel, then discovered by Godard.
Karina also worked, among other illustrious directors, with Luchino Visconti.
In a bold undertaking at the time, the actress later got behind the camera to make her own movie in 1973, “Vivre Ensemble” (Living Together).
Films that Karina has appeared in will be shown on the silver screen again with a retrospective of Godard starting next month at the Cinemateque, a noted film institution in France which she had frequented.

KATHMANDU: After successfully performing in Brisbane, Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart, Nepal’s famous folk-rock band, Nepathya, captivated the full-house audience at Big Top Auditorium in Luna Park of Sydney, Australia, on Saturday.
Performing for the fifth time in Sydney, Nepathya, entertained the audience with their mix of old and new songs with a great effect of the latest technology at the sold-out auditorium this weekend.
With this show, Sydney hosted Nepathya’s concert for the record fifth time. Nepathya has already performed more than five times in Kathmandu, Pokhara, Butwal, Chitwan, Hetauda and Dhangadhi within Nepal.
As the show went on, band’s lead singer and social activist Amrit Gurung said, “I still remember our first concert ten years ago as there were fewer Nepalis living in Sydney. However, during the last decade, Nepali diaspora has migrated looking for opportunities all over the globe.”
“Nepal would be a prosperous nation if it could do enough to stop the flow of brain-drain in the near future,” Amrit Gurung added.
“I see future in youths like you, who have gained knowledge, skills and experience in a foreign land, to transform the course of the nation like ours. Although our predecessors failed to create opportunities for us, we should be able for the next generation in Nepal, “Amrit Gurung shared.
As usual, Gurung was supported by Dhurba Lama on drums, Suraj Thapa on keyboards, Subin Shakya on bass guitar, Niraj Gurung on guitars and Shanti Raymajhi on madal.
After the Sydney show, Nepathya’s concert entourage will head to final stop-over in Melbourne to perform on December 23, the band said.
Nepathaya is currently touring Australia for the fifth time with new music series.

97,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/lemonade-by-beyonce-is-named-the-aps-album-of-the-decade/,"NEW YORK: The top 15 albums of the decade by Associated Press Music Editor Mesfin Fekadu:

Beyoncé, “Lemonade”: At the beginning of this decade, Beyoncé was already the greatest singer of her generation. She won a record six Grammys in a single night, had women AND MEN “oh-oh-oh’ing” to the fun sound of “Single Ladies” and continued to be a beast of a performer. But somehow Superwoman — shoot, she’s Superman, too! — found a way to do more: Like a boss she launched her own company, Parkwood Entertainment, and really took the bull by the horns of her career. In 2011, she released the R&B adventure “4,” featuring classics like “Countdown,” “Love on Top,” “Party,” “End of Time,” “I Care” and “I Miss You.” Three years later — in surprise form — came “Beyoncé,” her bold, audacious and daring album that showcased a new side of Beyoncé: Goodbye was the girl who cared about topping the charts, and born was an artist, a true storyteller, a grown woman. Somehow, she topped herself again with “Lemonade,” which still tastes as good as it did when it was released in 2016. The usually private Beyoncé bares her soul on the album, singing about a troubled relationship, black pride and motherhood in a brave way. Lyrically, she’s on point and honest over beats and sounds that range from rap to rock to country and pop. “Who the (expletive) do you think I am,” she brashly asks on “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” which co-stars Jack White. The answer: the greatest of all time.
Rihanna, “Anti”: Something was in the water in 2016: Beyoncé delivered “Lemonade” and Rihanna gave us the best album of her career with “Anti.” Rihanna had been moving like the Energizer Bunny since releasing her first album in 2005. She also put out albums in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 — showing that she was a singer who knew how to pick a hit, record it and make it sound better than any other artist could. But she took four years to create “Anti,” and the time was used wisely. No need to hit the skip button on this album as Rihanna shows her sultry side on “Kiss It Better,” her twerk side on “Work” and her vocal chops on “Love on the Brain.” Her hard work, work, work, work, work, work has truly paid off.


Beyoncé, “Beyoncé”: See earlier entry.
Adele, “21”: Back in my day — well in 2010 — record labels sent albums months in advance, and in November 2010 I received Adele’s “21.” Everything else around had to be turned off. I was sucked in. Months later, so was the world. THE ENTIRE WORLD. Adele was impressive on her 2008 debut, especially on “Hometown Glory,” but with “21” she went deep, too deep, she was rolling in the deep! Literally. Each song made you feel something — sad, lonely, bouncy, fired up, calm, angry, lost. And nine years later, each song sounds as classic as they did at first listen, especially “Turning Tables,” “Set Fire to the Rain” and the incomparable “Someone Like You.”
Kendrick Lamar, “good kid, m.A.A.d city”: All of Kendrick Lamar’s albums released this decade have been masterpieces, including the 2011 independent release “Section.80” as well as the major-label projects “To Pimp a Butterfly” and “DAMN.,” which won him the Pulitzer Prize for music as he made history as the first non-classical or jazz artist to win the prestigious prize. Lamar has profoundly mixed his poetry with hip-hop, jazz, soul, funk and African music to create songs that tackle blackness, street life, police brutality, survival and self-worth. And with 2012’s “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” this great kid immediately raised the bar not in only in hip-hop, but in music period, forcing his peers to do better and try harder.
HAIM, “Days Are Gone”: The sister trio HAIM reached perfection on their debut album. Hit play. And that is all.
SZA, “Ctrl”: SZA is masterful and introspective on her confessional debut album, which follows a young woman going through life and the turbulent experiences that come with it, from dating dusty boys to dealing with self-doubt.


Janelle Monáe, “The ArchAndroid”: According to contemporary pop folklore, Janelle Monae arrived on the pop landscape from another planet, and boy do we need more artists from that sphere to land here now. On the beautifully theatrical “The ArchAndroid,” she brilliantly paints the picture of an android, Cindi Mayweather, who finds out she is the chosen one and is trying to figure out how to handle her newfound mission. The versatile album has so many highpoints, including the Fela-flavored “Dance or Die,” the playful “Tightrope,” the groovy “Locked Inside” and the addictive “Faster.”
Katy Perry, “Teenage Dream”: I’ll quote the opening line of my 2010 “Teenage Dream” review, which came before the album matched the record Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” set by launching five No.1 hits: “Katy Perry’s new CD is like a magical slot machine: Select any song and you’ll hear a hit.”
Bruno Mars, “24K Magic”: Bruno Mars released three epic albums this decade, but “24K Magic” was a whole mood.
Solange, “A Seat at the Table”: Solange’s art-piece of an album will move you to think, and sing along, at the same time.
Sam Smith, “In the Lonely Hour”: Unrequited love ruled Sam Smith’s debut album, introducing the world to a piercing voice that is brave and honest.
Nas, “Life Is Good”: Nas is still the best rapper alive. Don’t at me.
Taylor Swift, “1989”: After dabbling in it on “Red,” former country singer Taylor Swift hopped, skipped and jumped into the pop music world with “1989,” an adventurous album full of hits, hits and more hits.
Kacey Musgraves, “Golden Hour”: With timeless songs like “Space Cowboy,” “Butterflies,” “Slow Burn” and “Lonely Weekend,” Kacey Musgraves proved to not just be golden, but grand.

NEW YORK: Stocks ended slightly higher on Friday, helped by better-than-expected quarterly results from Google’s parent Alphabet and retailer Amazon and a modest recovery in oil prices.
However, the gains were held back by disappointing results from Exxon Mobil as well as news out of the Bank of Japan, which did not announce as much stimulus as many had hoped.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 24.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,432.24.
The Dow was held back partly by a drop in the oil giant Exxon Mobil. The company reported its smallest quarterly profit in 17 years, well below what analysts were looking for, due to the continuing weakness in oil prices. Its major competitor, Chevron, fared slightly better. While earnings dropped sharply from a year ago, Chevron’s results still beat analysts’ expectations.
Exxon fell $1.25, or 1.4 percent, to $88.95. Chevron climbed 69 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $102.48 after being down earlier in the day.
Broader market indicators ended higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,173.60 and the Nasdaq composite increased 7.15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,162.13.
Wall Street is finishing out its busiest week of corporate earnings, which was dominated by mostly strong results from technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and others.
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped $25.50, or 3.3 percent, to $791.34. The company reported earnings of $8.42 a share, well above the $8.04 that analysts were looking for.
Amazon rose $6.20, or 1 percent, to $758.81. The online retail giant reported a profit of $1.78 per share, well above the $1.11 a share that analysts expected. Amazon reported it sold $30.4 billion in goods in the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier.
The strong results from Amazon and Google, as well as the results from other tech companies, helped lift the technology-heavy Nasdaq 1.2 percent this week, while the Dow lost 0.8 percent. The S&P 500 closed the week down slightly. It was the first weekly loss for the S&P 500 after four weeks of gains.
So far, corporate profits appear to be coming well ahead of what were very low expectations. Earnings in the S&P 500 so far are down 2.4 percent from a year ago, which is better than the 5.2 percent decline expected when earnings season started, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“Expectations were exceptionally low for the second quarter. While consumers goods and technology has been better than expected, the energy sector continues to show challenges,” said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock.
Investors remain cautious, however. The run-up earlier this month made stocks more expensive than investors are historically comfortable with. The S&P 500 is trading at 18.5 times its expected earnings for the next year, noticeable above the 12-14 times investors typically look for.
The presidential election will continue to grow as an issue for markets in the next several months. Investors dislike uncertainty, and the unexpectedly close presidential election and mostly unknown policies of Donald Trump puts them on edge.
Next week another fifth of the S&P 500 will report their results, including Proctor & Gamble, General Motors, Kraft Heinz, 21st Century Fox and Allstate, among many others.
Moore also pointed out the July jobs report, released August 5, will give investors direction since the June and May jobs reports showed two clashing directions for the US economy.
Japan’s central bank ended a policy meeting Friday by announcing it will expand purchases of exchange traded funds from financial institutions to help inject more cash into the world’s third-largest economy and pursue its 2 percent inflation target. But the measures fell short of hopes for more aggressive action. That helped the yen surge as investors priced in fewer yen in circulation. The dollar dropped to 102.03 yen from 105.45 yen.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury note falling to 1.46 percent from 1.51 percent the day before.
In energy trading, benchmark US crude reversed earlier losses and was up 46 cents to close at $41.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 24 cents to $42.46 a barrel in London.
Heating oil rose less than 1 cent to $1.28 a gallon, wholesale gasoline futures rose 1 cent to $1.32 a gallon and natural gas fell was little changed at $2.88 per thousand cubic feet.
In other currencies, the euro rose to $1.1179 from $1.1073 the day before and the British pound rose to $1.3239 from $1.3148.
The price of gold closed up $16.70 to $1,349 an ounce, silver rose 16 cents to $20.31 an ounce and copper rose a penny to $2.222 a pound.

Five years after United Airlines and Continental merged, Munoz declared in a public letter published in national newspapers on Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015, that the combined company has failed to live up to the expectations of both fliers and United’s employees.

NEW YORK: Five years after United Airlines and Continental merged, the company’s new CEO declared in a public letter that the combined company has failed to live up to the expectations of both fliers and United’s employees.
Just three weeks into the job, CEO Oscar Munoz acknowledged in full-page newspaper ads that “the journey hasn’t always been smooth.”
Since the merger, United has been plagued with chronic delays, computer outages and dissatisfied workers, who have a reputation for taking out their frustrations on fliers. The problems overshadowed the tenure of former CEO Jeff Smisek, who took over the combined airline when the merger closed on Oct. 1, 2009.
On Sept. 8, Chicago-based United Continental Holdings said Smisek was ousted following an internal investigation into the airline’s dealing with the public agency that operates its hub airport in Newark, New Jersey. That agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is part of a federal investigation into abuse of power. Munoz, a railroad executive and head of United’s audit committee, was named president and CEO.
In his letter, which ran in national newspapers, Munoz didn’t offer any hints as to how he will actually fix United’s many problems except that he will listen to fliers and employees.
“We are committed to re-earning your trust,” he wrote.
The company set up a website, UnitedAirtime.com, for people to ask questions and provide feedback to the airline. The airline posted a few questions and answers in advance of the site’s launch that focus on delayed luggage delivery, aging airplanes that lack Wi-Fi or working TVs and the poor quality of first-class meals.
“Let’s be honest, the implementation of the United and Continental merger has been rocky for customers and employees,” Munoz says on a video greeting on the site. “While it’s been improving recently, we still haven’t lived up to our promise or our potential.”

WASHINGTON: US manufacturers expanded at their slowest pace in two years last month, held back by faltering global growth and cutbacks in oil and gas drilling.
The Institute for Supply Management says its index of factory activity fell sharply to 50.2 in September from 51.1 in August. That is the lowest level since May 2013. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders and production both fell sharply and a measure of hiring also declined, according to the ISM, a trade group of purchasing managers. All three still barely remained in expansion territory.
US manufacturers are getting hit by slower growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy, and a stronger dollar, which makes US goods more expensive overseas. Oil and gas drillers are also cutting back on their orders for steel pipe and other goods in the wake of sharply lower oil prices.
China’s factory activity contracted last month, according to a survey of its purchasing managers, though its manufacturing index inched up to 49.8 from 49.7 in August.
Manufacturers cut 15,000 jobs last month, the most in five years, payroll services provider ADP said Wednesday. The government will release its jobs report Friday, and economists forecast it will show that the economy added 206,000 jobs overall.
The unemployment rate is expected to remain at a seven-year low of 5.1 percent.
Most economists expect US manufacturing will do little for the economy for the rest of the year, with the possible exception of automakers. But so far, healthy consumer spending on cars, homes and restaurant meals is offsetting overseas weakness and driving modest growth.

Are we utilising resources to the best of our ability?
As Shahrukh Khan stated in the blockbuster film, ‘Chennai Express’ — “Don’t underestimate the power of a common man”, the financial markets can deliver the same phrase with a twist. Don’t underestimate the power of information! In the age of technology and information, the world of traders has been enveloped by numerous data and reports. Life, as the traders know it, has been surrounded by scores of data emancipating from various economies and every second matters in the race towards accomplishing profits. With the passage of time, global markets have provided innovative ways to look at the markets and the fundamentals within it. Given that global markets are operating 24 hours a day and five days a week, inevitably investors will enhance their knowledge levels.
In recent times, during market operation, information does stem out from every corner of the globe with astounding pace that traders need to keep an eye on every major economy around the globe. Given the markets is a convergent point for the constant flow of information, investors should weigh the data and incorporate the ones which one feels will be imperative to his trading strategies. Easier said than done, the preceding sentence might leave some readers with a raised eyebrow and an immediate question — how do I weigh the information or how can I know the importance of such information?
In the first few trades, it is important to follow the impact of such information and wait to enact on the appropriate trade. With experience, the trader will learn the importance of such information and incorporate similar strategies in the ensuing days too.
But given the importance of the word ‘information’, are we utilising resources to the best of our abilities? Having undertaken numerous training classes related to the markets, I have noticed that participants have not been keeping themselves updated with the latest developments from around the globe. It is next to impossible to throw the dart expecting to find the bull’s eye when darkness has clouded the room. However, with light, the task of finding the bull’s eye becomes a tad easier. Information is the light, guiding traders and making the process of trading more effective.
A mentor once said — “information from the markets, if interpreted and processed in the right manner, will always reap greater results in the forthcoming days.” In contemporary times, processing the given information is a major challenge for the prevailing investors. In theory, trading seems easier but when theory has to be converted into practice, life does not seem to be easy. However, with experience and practice, one will surely master the art of trading from the given processed information. Hence, information is the most important commodity in today’s global financial world.

FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

Two is always better than one. When it comes to making a powerful impact, one needs to learn to effectively coordinate and collaborate. In every session, our aspiring change makers meet and learn from like-minded individuals and get exposed to new avenues to foster collaboration, expand their ideas, and maximise their efforts. Currently, our participants are working with various organisations and communities to implement their ideas and reach out to the right people with the right solutions and right attitude.

Martina Gautam
Morning shows the day. Youngest amongst the 13 girls, Martina Gautam believes in giving her best in whatever she does. A recent high school graduate, she wants to pursue Biomedical engineering in her undergraduate studies. Head strong about her goals, she leaves no opportunities behind to achieve them.
When EmpowHER came around, she knew what she needed to do. The idea of sharing the same platform with other like-minded women and learning new things excited her. She joined EmpowHER with a hope to improve her leadership skills, and bring back her experience and understandings to her students.
She has been working as a teacher since the last three years at a women’s school in her neighbourhood. Many of her students work as domestic helpers in dif ferent houses in the community. In exchange for school fees, many young women from rural Nepal travel to the capital to work as domestic helpers. Despite mistreatment and abuse, these girls stay with their host families so that they can receive free schooling. But most of them do not even get to go to school, and even if they do they cannot concentrate and lag behind in their classes due to over workload. Therefore, through her EmpowHER ‘Impact Service Project’ Martina will provide free coaching classes to help these girls with their assignments and class works including sessions on ESL, mathematics, and computer courses. Based on their performance in the coaching classes, she will provide
scholarships to few students to support their tuition fees. She hopes her effort will
help at least few young women to pursue education without being forced into domestic labour.
For her, EmpowHER has exceeded her expectation. It has offered more than she had anticipated, helping her gain more clarity about her goals and herself.
Change maker #10:
Nisha Bhatt
Reap what you sow. Nisha Bhatt who is a second year Bachelor’s student of Social Science knows that to get good results you need to put in good effort. Passionate about
social change, she believes that a society can only be progressive when women are
given their basic rights without hesitance.
Through her ‘Impact Service Project’, she wants to create awareness about “Chaupadi”, an old tradition that banishes women during their menstruation forcing them to live in a sheds or outbuildings. They have limited food, poor sanitation, and are vulnerable to wild animal attacks and sexual harassments. Despite being
outlawed in 2005, many families in Western Nepal still practice this detrimental and life threatening tradition. She wants to pilot her project in Mashfal VDC in Dolpa, where many women have lost their lives to Chaupadi. With the help of her project, she will be providing awareness trainings in the community to help women overcome the social pressure to practice such traditions, and establish an understanding of menstruation as a biological process rather than a regressive social practice. She will also provide trainings on women health and how women can take care of themselves while they are menstruating. She hopes that her efforts will help the community gain a different perspective on women menstruation, leading to both behavioral and social change towards such practices.
She joined EmpowHER to empower herself so that she can enable other women in the community. Through EmpowHER she has been able to strengthen her interpersonal skills, better herself as a leader, and develop ever lasting sisterhood.
As the journey of EmpowHER progresses, we see the passion, focus, and the sense of responsibility towards the community brewing strongly in our participants. We are confident that these change makers will leave no stones unturned to make a powerful impact anywhere they go.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

105,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

106,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

107,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/trade-with-confidence/,"IT IS SEEN THAT TRADERS FOCUS ON RESULTS RATHER THAN PROCESS

KATHMANDU: Trade outcomes cannot be assured. The market might be predicted up to some level but its result is uncertain. You entered a market with full preparation to come out successful and it happened to be same as predicted but it can be the other way too; you entered a market with full study and analysis and relied on probabilities to come out successful but it had an unexpected outcome. The nature of trading is like that. Due to its nature and effect on the psyche of human being, it is essential to have a lot of self-confidence.
Self-confidence is an element which is required in every field to excel. Without this underlying competence, a person cannot grow and be ahead. It is rightly said that ‘Without confidence, we can do little in life. With it, we can change the world’. Confidence is a tool which when used in trading can have a positive impact and help to improve the performance thereon. Self-confidence in trading is the ability to focus on improvement and better performance thereby keeping self away from negative thought patterns like fear, greed, anxiety, et cetera.

Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade

Many traders have the misconception that winning trades develop confidence but the fact is just the opposite. More winning trades come from a dedicated focus on the process of trading where traders develop their skills and in doing so, develop their confidence. Focus on the process of trading is very important but very often, it is seen that traders focus on results rather than process. Soon if a trader sees a loss or two in a strategy they attempted, they will discard the strategy. This attitude leads only to frustration. So, in the phase of trading it is quite important to understand how we learn. Learning does not start at point A and steadily progress to point B; it is not a linear. Learning occurs in a series of ups and downs. We grow a little, fall back a bit, advance some more, take breaks and this is how it goes.
Other thing which leads to confidence development is positive thoughts. Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade. They don’t have a negative outlook. Rather they are quite optimistic and try to learn from their mistakes. It is said that positive outlook brings out positive result and the same applies to trading too. So instead of burdenning your mind with negative thoughts and wasting your time, be positive and think of how you can plan your trade better and follow it properly.
Develop self-confidence and you will see a better performance in your trade!

108,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/entrepreneur-juggler/,"“START SMALL, REALLY SMALL. TEST YOUR BUSINESS MODEL BEFORE YOU REACH OUT TO THE MASS.”

KATHMANDU: Amun Thapa, 27, owner/co-owner of five companies combined suggests that he is an ‘entrepreneur juggler’. When asked what it means, he states, “Someone who is constantly juggling between several ventures. At present, I manage Sasto Deal, Sasto Book, Irish Pub, Chhahari Production and Anthropose. A few other interesting projects are in the pipeline.”
Before asking him how he manages to look after all of these, I was curious to know where he started. Amun, I discovered, sees things in black and white without much grey areas. “For any problem, there are two approaches — to complain or to seek for solutions. I have always taken the latter approach. I never intended to become an entrepreneur. But the problems I personally faced in Nepal and elsewhere got me to come up with solutions, and hence the businesses I am involved with,” he shares. He says that getting where he is today was not an easy task. In his own words, “The first and foremost hurdle, when starting a business, is to understand the local legal and tax systems. Nepali entrepreneurs still do not have a clear understanding of how they should go about when it comes to taxation. It is a shame but also a reality that most businesses operate without proper registration and billings. This makes it difficult for other businesses to work. Also, finding the right employees is another major challenge here, apart from building culture.”
Amun shares that getting investment for a start-up in Nepal was a daunting task. He blames the regulations set by the Central Bank for Foreign Direct Investment and suggests that the easiest route is to seek for investment among friends and family. With profit margins depending on the venture/start-up, Amun says that the first year of the start-up, he did not care much about the profit margin but diverted their efforts in generating brand awareness. He shares, “This is when the advertisement costs are at their maximum. But to put it in numbers, a venture must seek at least 10 per cent to 40 per cent profit margin for it to be sustainable and scalable.”
On employees he says, “The smartest thing to do is ignore the resume because it tells nothing about an employee. We hire them on the basis of their performance during their internship period (which usually lasts for two months). Most of them come through referrals. We also have performance incentives to encourage employees to work at their level best. As for salaries, I believe everyone deserves to be paid well, like the saying goes — if you look after your employees, they will look after your clients.” He opines that he would definitely focus more on technology if he had the chance to start over again. “Over the past four years I have witnessed consumers adapting to changes in technology. People have taken to Facebook and Viber for communication, apps are replacing websites, and such. I was talking to a hotel owner in Pokhara yesterday and he told me, one of the first things people ask for after checking-in is the WiFi password.”
When asked about the Nepal’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, Amun says diversification is the key. “Nepal is now not only relying on tourism and hydropower and banking industries as income generating businesses but there are a lot more new industries that were introduced to the market in the past several years. Therefore, we are definitely on the right track.” His words of wisdom for the ones starting out are, “Start small, really small.
Test your business model before you reach out to the mass. Focus on building systems because this comes in handy when you are scaling your businesses. And always give priority to your brand because revenues can go up and down but your brand is what keeps you going.”

Altice expands in US with USD 17.7 billion Cablevision deal
European telecoms group Altice will become a major force in the lucrative US cable market after it agreed to buy fourth-largest operator Cable vision for a mix of cash and shares in a deal worth USD 17.7 billion including debt.
The move is the latest foray by French-Israeli billionaire and Altice founder Patrick Drahi, who built a telecoms and cable empire in recent years via debt-fueled acquisitions in France, Portugal and Israel.Drahi entered the United States in May by buying small regional cable group Suddenlink for USD 9.1 billion and had declared he would do more acquisitions so as eventually to earn half of Altice’s revenue there.
GM to pay USD 900 million settles US criminal case
General Motors Co (GM.N) has agreed to pay USD 900 million and sign a deferred-prosecution agreement to end a US government investigation into its handling of an ignition-switch defect linked to 124 deaths, two sources told Reuters. The deal means GM will be charged criminally with hiding the defect from regulators and in the process defrauding consumers, but the case will be put on hold while GM fulfills terms of the deal, one source said. No individuals would be charged in the criminal case, one of the sources said. The company’s expected USD 900 million payment, confirmed by a second source, is less than the USD 1.2 billion that Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) paid to resolve a similar case.

Global stocks at three-week highs as Fed decision looms
World stocks inched to a three-week high on Thursday while the dollar drifted lower against other currencies, as investors consolidated positions ahead of a nail-biting US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. There was a sense of relief as much as anything that after months of market speculation and advice from almost everyone from the IMF to the heads of the world’s top companies, that the wait for the Fed’s verdict would be over by 1800 GMT. Europe’s main share markets were left at a virtual standstill with Britain’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 all barely budged after two days of gains helped by a flurry of merger activity.Currency and bond market moves were low key too.
Wal-Mart worker group splits in two
A Wal-Mart Stores Inc worker group that has been one of the loudest voices pushing the retailer to boost wages and improve conditions has splintered over a disagreement about funding and strategic direction, according to people on both sides of the split. Both wings are claiming the name OUR Walmart and vow to continue their work, moves that could sow confusion among supporters.The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which for years has provided important funding and resources to the OUR Walmart worker group, will only financially support the wing that it believes represents the broader set of workers. “Recently we had a group split from us,” said Barbara Getz, who said she is head of the health and safety team for the OUR Walmart grouping that is sticking with UFCW.

AUSTRALIA

US Fed may not hike interest rates
The Australian share market has surged ahead of highly anticipated US Federal Reserve rates call, as energy stocks soar on a strong bounce in crude oil prices. Investors remain upbeat approaching the US Federal Reserve’s decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, with financial markets predicting a 30 per cent chance of lift-off. At the 4.15pm (AEST) official market close, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 added 47.9 points, or 0.94 per cent, to 5146.8 points, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 47.6 points, or 0.93 per cent, to 5171.2 points. The growing sense that the US Fed may not hike interest rates has also pushed the Australian dollar above US72c for the first time in three weeks as per The Australian.
Australian shares rose 1.5 per cent on Thursday for a second straight day of gains as all sectors rallied ahead of the US Fed’s interest rate decision later in the day. Banks and miners were among the clear winners with the “Big Four” lenders rising more than two percent in early trade. A jump in oil prices pushed energy stocks higher. The S&P/ASX 200 index added 73.83 points to 5,172.7 by 0215 GMT. The index closed 1.6 per cent higher on Wednesday, and is on track to post a second straight weekly gain. Analysts said the market could claw back some of the day’s gain as the near-month futures contract expires on Thursday and could add some volatility. Asian stocks hit a three-week high on Thursday after a jump in oil prices lifted Wall Street, with many investors taking last-minute positions ahead of the Fed’s policy decision.

BANGLADESH

Secretary of state for treasury ministry
According to The Daily Star, Poland is interested in investing in mining, coal extraction and installation of liquefied natural gas terminal in Bangladesh as the European country has experience in the sectors, a deputy minister said yesterday. Zdzislaw Gawlik, secretary of state for the treasury ministry, also said his country is keen to explore shell gas in Bangladesh. “We are bringing in very solid proposals of investment in Bangladesh,” he said. “I know Bangladesh is developing at a faster rate. So we are working at the government-to-government and business-to-business levels to intensify bilateral relationship.”
Tea prices in Bangladesh edged higher for a second straight week at the weekly auction on Tuesday amid tight supplies and strong demand for quality leaf. Bangladeshi tea fetched an average 187.93 taka (USD 2.4) per kg at the 19th auction of the current marketing season, slightly up from 185.81 taka at the previous week’s sale when the prices snapped seven-week losing streak, an executive with National Brokers said. There was huge demand for quality tea, while volume dropped again this week compared with last week, helping prices to perk up, the executive said. About 1.93 million kg was offered at the sole auction centre in Chittagong, of which 6.5 per cent was unsold. In the previous auction, about 10 per cent of the 2.17 million kg offered went unsold. The national budget for the 2015/16 fiscal year that started in July raised the regulatory duty on tea imports by five per cent to discourage overseas buying. Tea prices fell sharply in the last marketing season on poor demand from local buyers as business sentiment was hit by renewed political unrest early this year that left more than 120 people dead and disrupted supplies. The country, however, has moved from being a net exporter to a net importer of tea due to rising consumption.

CHINA

Activists rally ouside the White House
China’s economic powerhouse is slowing, destabilising global markets. Beijing’s neighbors, unnerved over its pursuit of territorial claims, are increasingly cosying up to Washington. A threat of US cyber sanctions looms over Chinese companies. It might seem an ideal time for US President Barack Obama to take advantage of Beijing’s troubles and get tough when he hosts Chinese leader Xi Jinping for a state visit on September 25. Obama is expected to press Xi on issues that have strained relations between the two countries, but his approach will be tempered because for better or worse the world’s two biggest economies are inextricably bound together. That will mean a difficult balancing act for Obama. He is under pressure to send a strong message to Xi over cyber spying, Chinese economic policies and South China Sea disputes, but he does not want to upend a summit that could set the tone for relations for his last 16 months in office.
Just as China shows that its domestic stock market can be something of a one-way street — investors can put money in, but not take money out — the biggest mutual fund company, Vanguard Group, is moving ahead with plans to expose more mom-and-pop investors to the country’s heavily restricted exchanges. With the Shanghai stock exchange down by 37 per cent and the Shenzhen exchange off by 43 per cent during the past three months, compared with just an 18 per cent drop on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, Vanguard is adding China mainland stocks to its USD 60 billion emerging markets fund in the coming year.Vanguard says adding A-shares — stocks that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, as opposed to those that trade on the Hong Kong exchange — will diversify the fund, but acknowledges they pose unique risks related to tracking a benchmark. Steps taken by the Chinese government to restrict trading on domestic exchanges make it difficult for index funds to buy the stocks they need to replicate the performance of Chinese benchmarks, fund executives said.

EUROPE

Nestle fails to convince European judges
According to The Guardian, Nestlé has failed in an attempt to convince European judges to let it trademark the shape of the four-finger version of a KitKat in the UK. The European court of justice ruled that the KitKat’s shape was not distinctive enough for consumers to associate it with the chocolate covered wafer. Nestlé is not seeking to trademark its two-fingered version of KitKat. Nestlé had argued that even without its red and white packaging or the word KitKat embossed on the chocolate, the shape of the bar should be regarded as distinct. The dispute between Nestlé and Cadbury, which has fought to prevent Nestlé securing a trademark, will go back to the UK high court for a final ruling that will determine whether rivals will be able to launch copycat KitKats in Britain.Despite the court’s failure to allow the trademark, Nestlé said it was pleased with the ruling.
International creditors expect the first review of Greek reforms under the latest bailout to start in October, bringing changes to a memorandum of understanding signed with Athens and paving the way for debt rescheduling talks, Euro Zone officials said. Euro Zone finance ministers will discuss preparations for Greek reforms envisaged by the third bailout, worth 86 billion euros (USD 96.8 billion), at an informal meeting in Luxembourg on Saturday. No implementation review is possible before Greece’s September 20 parliamentary elections. “There are elections in Greece. We have to wait for the results,” Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna, whose country holds the EU’s rotating presidency, told Reuters in an interview.

INDIA

Reserve Bank of India headquaters, Mumbai
India requires sustained low inflation and a credible programme for fiscal rectitude to lower the cost of capital, Urjit Patel, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said on Thursday, striking a hawkish note after government calls for interest rate cuts to boost the economy. The central banker also said in a speech to a business conference that he expected India’s current account deficit to be 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product in the 2015/16 fiscal year. New banking licences issued by the RBI were also aimed at lowering the cost of capital, Patel said. His remarks addressed concerns that commercial banks have failed to pass on recent cuts in the RBI’s main policy rate to their borrowers.
India plans to address some pending tax disputes in the next few days, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday, but did not give details or say whether the cases in question included disputes with foreign companies that have spooked investors. Earlier this month, the finance ministry decided not to press claims for a Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) against foreign portfolio investors. India remains locked in major back-tax battles with telecoms group Vodafone (VOD.L) and Cairn Energy (CNE.L). Arun Jaitley said last week that the government was trying to resolve pending tax cases, many of them outside the courts.

JAPAN

Workers are seen in a container area at a port
Japan’s exports slowed for a second straight month in August in a worrying sign that China’s economic slowdown could deal a damaging blow to the world’s third-biggest economy and force policymakers to inject fresh stimulus before too long. The data joins a string of depressing shipment numbers in key regional economies — including South Korea and Taiwan — which has heightened anxiety over a China-led slowdown in global growth and tempered bets of the US Federal Reserve lifting rates for the first time in almost a decade later on Thursday.Slowing exports could increase the chance of additional monetary easing from the Bank of Japan, because this could lead to lower factory output, slack economic activity and less momentum needed to offset deflationary pressure caused by a collapse in oil prices.
Vietnam agreed with Japan on Tuesday to step up security cooperation, becoming the latest Southeast Asian country to seek closer ties with Tokyo as China maintains an assertive posture in disputed waters in the South China Sea. The agreement between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Vietnam’s Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong comes after a US expert said on Monday China appeared to be carrying out preparatory work for a third airstrip in contested territory in the South China Sea. China has overlapping claims with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei in the South China Sea. It is also embroiled in a row with Japan over a group of East China Sea islets. Earlier this year, Japan reached an agreement with Malaysia and the Philippines to strengthen security ties.

Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Thursday ahead of a likely policy move by the US Federal Reserve, with stocks in Malaysia outperforming and Singapore hitting a more than one-week high as a big jump in global oil prices boosted energy stocks. Oil prices jumped as much as six per cent on Wednesday after a US stock draw. Oil bulls were also encouraged by doubts on whether the Fed will decide to hike US interest rates on Thursday after tame August inflation data. Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur composite index was up 2.1 per cent on a rally in oil-related stocks. The index touched 1,691.93, a near six-week high, on resuming trade after a market holiday. Shares of oil and gas services firm Sapurakencana Petroleum Bhd was up seven per cent and Tenaga Nasional Bhd was 2.3 per cent higher, among top gainers.
While Malaysia’s premier faces tough questions over the origin of hundreds of millions of dollars transferred to his bank accounts, the country has tentatively received good grades for its anti-money laundering efforts from a team of international experts, documents reviewed by Reuters show. A draft report by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body which monitors how countries fight illicit financial flows, said Malaysia had put in place a “robust policy framework” to combat money laundering.But it said the Asian country needed to be more effective in targeting high-risk offences and needs to pay more attention to transnational crime. The draft, dated Aug 4 and marked for official use, said the FATF inspection team found the Malaysian government had a “strong political commitment and well functioning coordination structures” to fight money laundering and that “significant resources have been allocated” to investigations in this field.

RUSSIA

Launch of new Opel Astra to boost sales
General Motors (GM.N) executives said they remained committed to meeting their goal of reaching profitability in Europe by 2016, brushing aside concerns that a downturn in Russia could put their goal at risk. “We are confident about reaching our goal,” Opel Chief Executive Karl-Thomas Neumann told journalists at the Frankfurt auto show on Tuesday. In July, GM warned its European employees the Opel and Vauxhall brands were still posting significant losses, and meeting its goal of returning to profit by next year would be difficult given the crisis in Russia and the Euro Zone. But General Motors President Dan Ammann said on Tuesday the launch of a new Opel Astra would help boost sales.
Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc on Tuesday said it expected to complete its new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a soon-to-be banned Russian engine, but the date could slip if it does not receive enough US government funding. Aerojet Vice President Julie Van Kleeck declined comment on reports that Aerojet has offered USD two billion to acquire United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 rocket launch venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Analysts say the bid is a strategic move by Aerojet to shut out rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, that is developing a new engine favored by ULA for use in its new Vulcan rocket. ULA has said Blue Origin’s engine programme is about two years ahead of Aerojet’s work on the AR-1 engine, a claim Aerojet disputes.Work on the new engines gained urgency after US lawmakers passed a ban on use of Russian RD-180 engines for launches of US military or spy satellites following Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine last year.

PAKISTAN

A labourer moves sacks of cement
Pakistan and Afghanistan have shelved a raft of agreements that promised to more than triple cross-border trade, officials said, as economic ties seen as key to regional stability fall victim to rivalry and suspicion. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani struck the trade deals with Pakistan soon after taking office last year as part of a broader rapprochement that included plans to share intelligence on Taliban insurgents active in both countries. That cooperation was aimed at tackling the Islamist militant movement, which has separate Afghan and Pakistani branches whose violent campaigns kill thousands of people each year and hamper much-needed development. The trade deals were supposed to be a step towards warmer relations and boosting Afghanistan-Pakistan trade from USD 1.6 billion now to USD five billion by 2017. But officials told Reuters that the agreements, which include reducing tariffs and granting each other preferential trade status, have stalled.
Pakistani farmers will receive USD 3.2 billion in grants, subsidies and loan advances from the government, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced on Tuesday, in a bid to spur sluggish growth in one of the country’s main economic sectors. The new schemes represent the government’s largest economic development programme for the agricultural sector since it was voted into office in 2013.The funds will be provided through immediate cash grants and subsidies on agricultural inputs worth USD 1.4 billion, while loan advances worth USD 1.85 billion will also be made and disbursements begin this year, he said. “The conditions of the agricultural sector do not inspire confidence,” Sharif said as he announced the new package at a farmers’ convention in Islamabad. The package includes immediate cash grants for rice and cotton farmers, cuts in fertiliser prices, and a government scheme to pay insurance premiums for farmers who cannot afford them.

THAILAND

TAC plan expansion of it 4G mobile network
Thailand’s Total Access Communication Pcl (TAC) said on Thursday it is planning a major expansion of its fourth generation (4G) mobile network, as it seeks to displace rivals Advanced Info Service Pcl and True Corp. The country’s second largest mobile operator, controlled by Norway’s Telenor, has received regulatory approval to provide 4G services on the 1800MHz frequency band, which is currently used for 2G, Chief Executive Officer Lars Norling told a news conference. TAC also plans to increase its number of base stations to 32,000 in early 2016 from 17,000 now, aiming to provide 4G network coverage nationwide.
The Asian Development Bank will lower its 2015 GDP growth forecast for Thailand from the current 2.9 to 3.0 per cent following weaker-than-expected performance in the first half, the Bangkok Post reported, citing Luxamon Attapich, the bank’s senior economist for Thailand.The new growth forecast, due to be announced on Sept 22, will be higher than 2.5 per cent, the paper reported.

USA

A women walks past the FR headquaters
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has made clear she would rather delay an interest rate hike for too long than move sooner and risk jeopardising a tepid economic recovery, a conviction that will face its sharpest test yet on Thursday. Having weighed the economy’s steady march toward full employment against the backdrop of weak inflation and wage growth and turbulence overseas, the US central bank will issue its latest rate decision at the end of a two-day policy meeting. A rate hike would be the first in the United States in nearly a decade. Fed watchers, however, see the outcome as a toss-up, with Yellen’s consistently stated desire to see workers reap more benefits from the recovery, coupled with weak price rises and a variety of global risks, looming large. “It is a game-time decision. The key is what Yellen thinks and my guess is that she will want to wait,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. “If you put yourself in her shoes, you don’t want to make a mistake by going too soon.”
Oil prices were stable on Thursday as a US stock draw tightened the market while Asia’s economies showed new signs of weakness.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading at USD 47.13 per barrel at 0430 GMT, virtually unchanged from their previous close, while Brent was up 6 cents at USD 49.81 per barrel. That followed a price jump of as much as six per cent in the previous session when data from the US Energy Information Administration showed the largest crude drawdown since February 2014 at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point. Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures said that the stock draw was “a result of higher refining activity and lower US crude production which is helping the US inventory glut to ease off”.

110,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

111,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/weak-institutions-hit-economic-growth/,"Poor spending performance by public institutions a challenge for the economy
KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

KATHMANDU
Traders are simply investing their time, thinking that if they spend a lot of time around the markets, analysing charts, reading books and studying courses, their skill level will improve. Investing time is necessary when you are starting out, as there is a lot to learn. But putting in hours will not necessarily increase your profit potential. If you always repeat the same mistakes, putting in hours will just be meaningless with those habits in place. To improve, make repeated and deliberate choices. Here are five things to start doing today to improve your trading performance.
GET HELP
Trading is tough and not a cup of tea for everyone especially when we go at it completely alone. So choose a person who could be just a friend or family member who you have told your plans to and who you keep updated on your performance. Share what you are doing, what you are struggling with and what you are having success with. Anyone can get side tracked, so be open to being told when you have gone astray. When your own discipline and self-awareness fails, you will have someone to help you get back on track.
FOLLOW YOUR PLAN
Talking about strategies with other traders or discussing your performance with your trading referee is fine, but avoid the opinions of others when it comes to specific trades. Trade your trading plan, your way. It doesn’t matter if a trader you respect says they are going to buy when your plan says to sell.
PRACTICE
A strategy may seem simple on the surface, but even a simple strategy is hard to implement in live market conditions. Every day, every trend, every pullback is slightly different; nothing looks exactly the same as it did in the textbook examples. So trade it in a demoaccount until you consistently see profit from it.
MENTAL CLARITY
Each day take one minute before you trade to make sure you are feeling clearheaded and focused. Also take a couple of seconds to reiterate that you’re here to trade, not check your social media accounts, email or watch videos online. When you trade, simply focus on trading and leave other matters. Check the economic calendar to be aware of events that may move the market, so you are not taken by surprise during the day. If you are angry, upset or unfocused, avoid trading. It only takes one day, one trade even, to lose an entire account when not in the right mind frame.
RECORD YOUR TRADE
Review every trade you make. Take screenshots of your trades with entries, stop loss levels, targets, and your technical/fundamental notes so you can easily review your trades at a later time.

KATHMANDU
Hear it verbatim from Rajesh KC on how he aspires to build a world-class Nepali brand.
“I have been drawing cartoons since 1990s. Back then they were limited to my friend’s portraits but once I got the platform, I was able to polish my skills and dedicate my time and energy to the same. It has been 25 years now and I recently expanded the skills I have to something new.”
On Phalano Luga: “Phalano Luga came to me as a pleasant surprise. A friend of mine who owned a t-shirt store asked me to design a few prints for t-shirts. While designing, I thought to myself, ‘He might give me royalty and I might make some money out of the designs but why not create a Nepali brand in itself?’ I visited stores for market evaluation and realised that even though Nepal has a lot of talent in terms of designs, the fabric was not up to the mark. Even though the t-shirts had tags that said, ‘100 per cent cotton’, something was amiss. Phalano Luga came into existence with an ambition of creating a Nepali brand for Nepalis to wear. With the fabric imported from Ludhiana, India, and the manufacturing factory located in Patan, I have been able to give the market what I had in mind. The printing machines are imported from California and are top class and that is how I had imagined my brand to be — uncompromising and pocket-friendly.”
On growth: “Initially, I had a target of selling at least one t-shirt per day. I thought that the concept of a Nepali brand might take some time to build but I am surprised with the exponential growth Phalano Luga has seen. In the past two years, my dream of selling one t-shirt per day has topped 30 t-shirts per day.”
On workers: “This is one of the bigger challenges I face. Retaining workers and getting the best ones is a big challenge. A group of Nepali workers are coming back to Nepal from Malaysia to work with me. Apart from retaining them, paying them the same amount they used to earn overseas is a challenge. The people I am working with right now are also working with the production unit of Nike, Adidas, Peter England and other such global brands, based in Nepal. The problem is not the quality of the workers, but the economy and the quality of local materials available.”
On funds: “While starting the business off, my bank was skeptical about giving me a loan. My capital investment was close to one crore and after convincing the bank, I had 30 per cent of the costs covered. Most of the funds were drawn from my own pockets.”
On new ventures: “As of now, with more than satisfactory sales, I have the confidence of expanding my business across the country and abroad. But my first priority would be maintaining the quality for a while before dreaming big. Phalano Coffeeghar which is the latest addition to my business venture is something I am looking up to for now. With Phalano Luga doing well, I partnered with an old friend, Prem Aryal and opened the cafe last week. I had the space and he had the ideas, we got together and came up with the Coffeeghar plan. Like the tees, the eatables available at the cafe will all be Nepali-centric. Long term plans for this cafe are branded water bottles and sugar sachets.”
On the future: “I aspire to make Phalano Luga as big as Nike and Adidas.”

Mad sad ad world. Graphic: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Kathmandu
With the country in dire need of post disaster economic recovery, it is expected that governing bodies address the concerns of major contributors to the GDP. The advertising industry is one such sector with the potential to help with economic recovery; and could provide a significant push towards an economic boom, just as the country needs it the most.
Advertising helps create successful businesses, which then lead to employment opportunities. Even media, the driving force behind growing economies, benefits from stability in the industry, as advertising is the chief source of revenue for mass media like newspapers, television, radio, print magazines and websites. Research has consistently shown that countries with larger investments in the advertising industry are more developed than other countries. For instance, the advertisement industry in the United States creates 18.2 million of the 126.7 million jobs. However, back home in Nepal, the predicament of the advertising industry is such that the government is yet to give due recognition to the industry.
According to the Advertising Association of Nepal (AAN), the total annual revenue of the advertising
industry is Rs 5.5 billion. While it is an industry with vast potential; it appears to lack order with various unresolved issues brimming under the surface.
The present scenario
Although at a very slow pace, the industry was witnessing growth before disaster struck. Post earthquake, the scenario looks far from encouraging. Is there a noticeable difference in the industry before and after the earthquake? Ranjit Acharya, CEO of Prisma Advertising says, “Before the earthquake, the industry was in its growing stage. Growth was rather slow but it was growing
nonetheless. Post earthquake, advertising agencies had to cut down on budgets, as it was the need of the hour. With no help from any quarter it was a necessity to cut down costs.” According to him, most businesses had to cut down on advertising budgets, which led to stagnancy in the industry. He says, “A person must seek medical help when ill and not cut down on medicinal costs. The same is with
advertisements.”
Deependra Tandon, Director of Business Advantage says, “In the first few months after the disaster in April/May we did not have any business. We have gradually recovered now and we hope that the business will revive in the festive season.” He adds that the business is still in its infancy and there is room for improvement.
Ahimsa Yonjan, Managing Partner at TBWA\Benchmark Nepal, says, “The earthquakes led to a rather disturbing slowdown for a month or two, but considering everything that has happened, the industry looks to have weathered the storm rather well”. He adds, “However, as an industry, we do not seem to have learned much from the experience, as there is actually very little difference in communication styles or brand behaviour before or after the earthquakes.”
The mushrooming of advertising agencies
AAN has 298 advertising agencies on its member roster, but there still exist several hundred more agencies that are not registered with the association. With so many advertising agencies operating in the market, it is still generally accepted that most of the advertisements that are produced in Nepal are not satisfactory. On this, Santosh Shrestha, President of AAN says, “Because there is no entry barrier to this industry, anyone can register and have an agency up and running in no time. While this opens a lot of doors for newcomers it leads to compromise on the quality. It becomes a tough job to monitor quality.” He further says, “The world of advertising is creative and fascinating. In Nepal, the industry has an estimated growth of 10 to 15 per cent annually. If we focus on quality control, nothing can stop this industry from growing in the coming years.”
Advertising agencies and advertisement standards
On the compromised quality of advertising and agencies not being up to the mark, Shrestha says, “The quality of advertisement depends of the level of awareness of the society, resources, budget and the economy. Advertisements reflect the attitude of the society. The market is small and the economy is not
progressive. The current focus is on production of effective advertisements rather than creative ones.”
He adds that they are responsible to cater to the mass with limited budget. He says, “Suppose there are three kids who study in grade three, six and eight. Now, all of them must be explained to in a similar manner, in a language they can comprehend. The teacher explains in the easiest way so that every one can understand. The same goes with advertisement.”
Joydeb Chackravarty, Managing Director, JWT – Thompson Nepal has a different view on this subject. He says, “Nepali consumers are exposed to creative advertisements, if not from within the country, but definitely from the world outside. They are intelligent and they know exactly what they want.
Advertisers should not underestimate their level of awareness and should not doubt their intelligence.”
He says that it is high time for the industry to push the envelope in terms of standards and creativity.
Yonjan says, “While I do agree that the overall quality of advertising could be a lot better, I think it is quite unfair to generalise and say that the quality of advertising agencies is not up to the mark. There are a few agencies doing good work locally, so we must give credit where it is due.” He further says, “As with any other industry however, a combination of many factors; such as, lack of industry knowledge and processes, timelines, an unwillingness to provide proper compensation on the side of all parties involved, leads to a large proportion of work being of poor quality. It is the same with art, music and movies. Much of what is produced is quite terrible, but there are those that stand out.”
The clean feed debate
For almost eight years now, AAN has lobbied with the government to introduce a Clean Feed Policy. This policy will ensure content filtering systems that can be used to block foreign commercials aired through foreign channels from reaching the Nepali audience. The main purpose of this policy will be to eliminate the trend of dubbing and encourage multinationals to produce and develop advertisements through local agencies.
Nirmal Raj Poudel, CEO of Welcome Advertising and Marketing, says, “Multinational companies dub foreign advertisements and broadcast them in local channels.  Further, the paid channels also include commercials. This results in quality compromise.”
However, some industrialists claim that clean feed is an uphill task in Nepal. They argue that competition will be killed with the introduction of this policy. A Clean Feed Committee has meanwhile been formed by AAN that has been doing research on the topic and is under dialogue with the government for a quick implementation of this policy.
The right way of doing things
According to some, one of the biggest challenges the industry currently faces is the lack of vision and leadership within the industry. Only self- regulation and quality checks can turn the industry around. Tandon says, “The change must start with the industry itself. Introducing policies is not enough for the development of the industry.” Yonjan has similar views, he says, “We cannot introduce laws to control or fix what are inherently industry problems. What is more necessary is an independent regulatory body that can develop and enforce a code of conduct/best practice model in place for the overall advertising market.”
Although the advertising industry is currently facing an uphill battle, this is still an industry that has enormous potential. With the industry only just beginning to mature, and mediums like digital and new age media opening up, there appears to be much to look forward to for the industry. For the rest of us, it remains the industry to watch.
In parting, it is perhaps Chakravarty who sums it up best — “The next five years are going to be challenging for the advertising industry in Nepal. However, if we follow the right way of doing things and remain honest and integrated there are chances that we can recover soon.”

The monsoon struck the village mid-June, but officials of Sangachowk VDC are still struggling to distribute cash relief to villagers.
Currently, the villagers are living inside temporary shelters made from rusted zinc sheets riddled with holes and timber salvaged from their damaged houses. They kept some zinc sheets and timber to shelter their cattle and poultry after distribution of relief amount was delayed.
Shyam Khadka, 55, of Pokhre said,”The rain water trickles through the zinc sheets. The families of my three sons are housed under one small temporary shelter. Even if the government distributes relief money it will not be sufficient to procure zinc sheets to construct temporary shelters that will accommodate the families of my three sons.”
Basanta Prasad Ghimire, secretary, Sangachowk VDC said cash relief had not been distributed as the registered households claiming cash relief outnumbered the actual damaged households.
“Over 28,000 households have registered for cash relief, whereas, the District Administration Office has allocated cash relief for only 22,000 households on the basis of existing documented records before the earthquake of April 25,” he said.
The government had announced immediate cash relief of Rs 15,000 for one damaged house. The joint families who have not legally divided properties are not eligible for immediate cash relief even if they had been staying in separate houses.
“The joint families who lost more than one house registered fore cash relief under names of different members of the same family,” Ghimire said, stressing that families who had lost more than one house are not satisfied with government policy.
He warned that a monitoring team comprising ward citizens’ forum would be deployed to find such joint families who had registered more than once for the same house before issuing the ID card to claim immediate cash relief and Rs 200,000 to further build a permanent house.
The government released Rs 5.53 billion to the local authorities for immediate relief countrywide in May.
According to District Disaster Relief Committee, the death toll was 3,656 in Sindhupalchowk. About 90 per cent of houses in the district were razed to the ground.

116,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/duplication-in-tax-headings-draws-flak/,"KATHMANDU: The draft of the new constitution has overlooked the concerns related to effective levying of major taxes and duplicated some tax headings in central and state governments, as well as provincial and local governments.
Such duplications might pose a threat to the revenue system once the country adopts a federal structure due to disputes of power allocation between central and provincial government to levy taxes, according to tax experts.
The draft constitution has proposed that excise and individual income tax can be levied by both the central and provincial governments. Similarly, it has also proposed that many other tax headings be levied by the provincial and local governments, like registration tax, vehicle tax and tourist fee.
“Even as related Acts will have to be formulated, the power allocation in the central, provincial and local governments will result in disputes when the laws related to taxes are enforced in the coming days,” opined Rup Khadka, tax expert and the chair of the government-formed High Level Tax System Review Commission. The draft constitution has extended authority to levy taxes, but it is silent on power allocation regarding enforcement, like what portion of the excise duty and IIT can be levied by the province and the portion of the registration and vehicle and land tax that can be levied by the local government.
Giving an example of South Sudan, Khadka said, “The taxes proposed to be levied by the central government were also placed in the domain of provincial government, which led to a dispute. It was later sorted out by forming a task force under the chairmanship of the finance minister of the centre, comprising finance ministers of provinces.”
According to him, it would be better to extend the authority to levy a certain tax to a particular government that can effectively levy that duty. “That power can be shared among other governments.”
The HLTSRC has suggested the finance committee of the Parliament to put customs, VAT, excise, corporate and individual income tax under the domain of the central government for effective enforcement, as these taxes are of stra-tegic importance and strong institutional mechanism is required to levy them effectively. Likewise, registration tax and vehicle tax have been recommended to be levied by provincial government.
Who is to levy what
Central government: Customs, excise, value added tax, corporate income tax, individual income tax, passport fee, visa fee, penalties and royalty of natural resources Provincial government: Wage tax (which covers large portion of individual income tax), land tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, excise, entertainment tax, advertisement tax, tourist fees, agriculture income tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources
Local government: Land and rent tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, service fees, tourist fees, business tax, entertainment tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources

117,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/development-bond-yields-fall-to-all-time-low/,"KATHMANDU: Yield on development bonds, regardless of their maturity period, has fallen to an all-time low, dampening sentiment of bankers, who have to tap the government securities market to meet some of the regulatory requirements.
Return on 15-year development bonds floated today by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) dropped to 2.65 per cent, the lowest since February 1964, when the government first introduced development bonds with a maturity period of five years to raise debt from the domestic market to finance development activities.
Surprisingly, returns on these securities are falling lately even as their maturity period is increasing.
When NRB auctioned five-year development bonds on May 28, the weighted average cut-off rate stood at four per cent. Then on June 4, when it floated seven-year development bonds, the return fell to 3.44 per cent.
The yield further dropped to 3.08 per cent when NRB offered nine-year development bonds on June 11.
The freefall continued on June 25 as well, when 10-year development bonds were floated. At that time, the weighted average interest rate had dropped to 2.99 per cent.
Considering 7.1 per cent inflation of mid-May, returns on these securities are negative in real term.
“Yields on bonds are falling rapidly because of excess liquidity in the banking sector,” Nara Bahadur Thapa, chief of Public Debt Management Department at NRB told The Himalayan Times.
Banks and financial institutions (BFIs) are currently sitting on excess liquidity of over Rs 70 billion. However, a large chunk of this money cannot be extended as loans because it is being used to meet the minimum regulatory net liquid asset to total deposit ratio, or LD ratio, of 20 per cent.
So, BFIs are rushing to grab these low-yielding securities assuming it is wiser to invest funds in bonds and get some returns rather than let them sit in coffers and generate no return.
Lately, what also appears to have exerted pressure on yields is the government’s decision to repay a part of debt.
So far this fiscal, the government has repaid Rs 42.55 billion of debt, including principal, shows the latest NRB report.
On the other hand, fresh government securities worth only Rs 42.34 billion have been floated in the market. This means net borrowing of the government stood at a negative of around Rs 211 million.
“Because of this, BFIs are rushing to replenish their stock of government securities to maintain LD ratio. This is raising the demand for bonds,” Thapa said, adding, “This is another reason for fall in bond returns.”
The falling bond return is, in fact, good news for the government, as it is now able to raise domestic debt at low interest rates. This means the cost of rebuilding parts of the country ravaged by the earthquake would be a little cheaper.
But bankers say this is creating ‘distortions’ in the market.
“Many BFIs that have purchased low-yielding instruments are now carrying a lot of market risk,” said Sashin Joshi, CEO of Nabil Bank.
This is because purchase of nine-, 10- and 15-year bonds is not a short-term investment, according to Joshi.
“And if returns on bonds rise next year, the instruments bought this year will turn into nothing but loss-making tools. At that time, many BFIs will have no option but to sell those instruments at a discount. This may hit their profitability as well,” Joshi added.

KATHMANDU: There is now little doubt that Pashupati Murarka, officiating president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), will take the helm of the largest private sector umbrella body tomorrow.
Murarka taking the lead of FNCCI has become a certainty after the two other contenders — Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar and Bhawani Rana — withdrew their candidacy for the post of FNCCI president from the election slated for tomorrow.
Organising a press meet on Tuesday, Rajkarnikar had announced his willingness to withdraw his candidacy and support Murarka if Rana also did the same. After Rana formally withdrew her candidacy yesterday, Rajkarnikar also formally pulled out his application today.
So, Murarka is the sole contender for the top post of FNCCI and will be announced as the unanimous president tomorrow. It also means that the post of senior vice president, which Murarka held before he took on the role of officiating chief of FNCCI, will be vacant.
Murarka had been appointed as the officiating president after its past president Pradeep Jung Pandey was arrested in a three-decade old corruption charge on March 18.
As per the FNCCI statute, election of the senior vice president should be done within five days of the president’s election. The senior vice president is elected from the executive committee, though the rest of the posts are filled through direct election.
According to FNCCI sources, there is general consensus among FNCCI members to select Bhawani Rana for the post of senior vice president. Leaders of the largest private sector umbrella body have claimed that rifts and groupism that occurred during the past elections will be bridged after the selection of a unanimous chief at FNCCI.

Nepal is hosting the Donors’ Conference for the reconstruction of the country in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes.
“Media reports that there was clash between us and there was lack of coordination while sending invitations to neighbouring countries are baseless. The finance minister and I were supposed to go to India and China respectively. But, I cancelled my visit to China after Chinese authorities informed us that Chinese foreign minister will not be able to participate in the conference due to prior engagement,” Pandey told the meeting of
National Disaster Management and Monitoring Special Committee of the Legislature Parliament headed by Speaker Subas Chandra Nembang today.
Finance Minister Mahat said that his ministry had prepared the 300-page Post Disaster Need Assessment, with the help of more than 200 experts divided into 23 sub-panels by working round the clock in view of the conference. “This is the official document of the government detailing the damage and need assessment. This document has created the base to see support from donor countries and inter-country agencies,” Mahat said.
The government has invited 65 countries and inter-governmental agencies, said Finance Mahat, adding: “Of them, 125 delegates of 40 countries and agencies have already expressed their commitment to participate in the conference”. Seven minister-level participants have sent their confirmation to participate in the conference, according to Mahat.
“Initially, donor countries wished to delay the conference to August-September. Citing the devastating earthquake situation, they proposed to hold the conference in New Delhi of India, Tokyo of Japan and Paris of France. They were reluctant to participate in the conference expressing their doubt over the safety of the participants as the situation had not been normal. However, we persistently stood on our stance of holding the conference in Kathmandu and made all arrangements for their safe living during their stay here. Ultimately, the donors were convinced and are expressing their commitment for their participation,” Mahat said.
Mahat said that the government would focus on foreign grant collection, sharing experiences of managing post-disaster situation and solidarity of friendly nations to Nepal’s crisis.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Pandey said that the government wanted to show the international community that the country was safe for tourism and it maintained complete harmony during the national crisis despite having around 125 different communities.
Mahat, responding to a complaint that Russian ambassador in Kathmandu did not get invitation till last Wednesday due to the government’s carelessness, said, “The government, six weeks ago, had emailed all the embassies and ambassadors in Kathmandu, making preliminary request to participate in the conference. The [Russian] ambassador had replied us via email that the country’s representative would not be able to participate in the conference due to pre-scheduled engagement on the conference day. Then, we did not send invitation to him. But, after we heard about the complaint, we have sent an invitation recently.”
Lawmakers including CPN-UML’s Madhav Kumar Nepal, Nepali Congress’s Ramchandra Paudel and Unified CPN-Maoist’s Girirajmani Pokharel, had urged the ministries to clarify the controversies related to the conference and suggested them to make the conference a success.
After listening to the two ministers, panel Chair Nembang instructed the government to take the neighboring countries and donors into confidence and also consultations with all the parties and take their feedback. Nembang also instructed the government to make an arrangement for making the foreign delegates observe the major tourist areas — both damaged and not damaged — independently during their visit to give a message that Nepal is safe for foreign tourists.

Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam informed that there will be a separate committee of foreign consultants that would be constantly supporting the Authority in its job.
According to the government’s assessment, the tremors caused damage worth Rs 513.38 billion to physical infrastructure and assets, and inflicted income loss of another Rs 187.08 billion.
The government has set the target to collect more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors for the post-earthquake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.

He, however, added that the nation also needs some long-term loads at a lower interest rate.
Addressing a meeting with former finance ministers, former vice-chairpersons of the National Planning Commission, former chief secretaries and former finance secretaries at the Ministry today, Mahat said the government has expected that international donors announce their support at the International Donors’ Conference scheduled for June 25.
He reiterated that the reconstruction campaign is not possible without support from the international community.
The Minister informed that Nepal has stressed on participation of higher-level representatives at the conference. “Many nations and organisations have assured us for the same,” Mahat claimed, “We have prepared well for success of the conference.”
The Ministry had invited former ministers, former NPC vice-chairs and former secretaries to collect suggestions for the event.
Ex-ministers Surendra Pande, Barshaman Pun and Shankar Koirala; former NPC vice-chairs Jagadish Pokhrel, Yuvaraj Khatiwada, Dipendra Bahadur Chhetri and Rabindra Kumar Shakya; former chief secretaries Bimal Prasad Koirala and Bhoj Raj Ghimire among others had floated their suggestions at the meeting.

Conflict Victims Common Platform today issued a press release strongly objecting to the nomination of office bearers in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons.
The recommendation committee formed under former chief justice Om Prakash Mishra to nominate office bearers of the two transitional justice mechanisms had recommended the office bearers yesterday.
CVCP said the recommendation committee endorsed the names recommended by the political parties that were indifferent to the pain and suffering of conflict victims.
Stating that their lack of imitative to amend the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, was one of the major causes behind the failure of the two transitional justice bodies, CVCP said the recommendation committee ignored the concerns of the conflict victims. CVCP further said it recommended party’s loyalists in the two transitional justice bodies without reviewing causes of their failure. CVCP said the rights of the victims could not be ensured by the two transitional justice bodies as they would be unable to investigate the cases of human rights violations in impartial and independent manner.
According to CVCP recommendation of the ‘loyalist and inefficient persons’ in the TRC and the CIEDP was made with the intention of to prolong the transitional justice process. CVCP said the government recently initiated the process to consult stakeholders on the proposal to amend the TRC Act, but that was mere eyewash. “We will not support the TRC and the CIEDP unless they are formed after consulting us and amending the TRC Act,” CVCP said in the release.
The organisation urged national and international stakeholders to exert pressure on the government to address concerns of the conflict victims.

More than four years after the devastating 2015 earthquakes, reconstruction of Rani Pokhari and Balgopaleshwor temple, which were completely damaged in the earthquakes, has finally gained momentum.
Authorities concerned have claimed that reconstruction work of the historic and religious  site will be completed by mid-May this year.

Reconstruction work had been in limbo for long after Kathmandu Metropolitan City proposed to rebuild the archaeologically important pond and the temple, located in the heart of the city using modern construction materials. The metropolis wanted to turn the pond into a recreational centre.
The metropolis had also hired a private contractor to pump out water and desiccate the pond after President Bidhya Devi Bhandari laid the foundation stone at the pond inaugurating the ‘mega reconstruction campaign’ on 16 January 2016.
The idea of using modern materials and desiccating the pond without proper homework had irked activists, who later obstructed the reconstruction process of the temple.
They later forced KMC to take out the concrete from the bottom of the pond. Activists had accused KMC of trying to convert the historic ‘naturally refilling’ pond into a ‘swimming pool’ by applying concrete at the bottom of the pond. KMC later reported that it incurred loss of Rs 20 million as it had to remove the concrete.
Activists were not contented only with this, they also demanded that Balgopaleshwor temple, which lies at the middle of the pond, be constructed in Granthakut model. Historians claimed that King Pratap Malla had built the temple in 1670 in Granthakut model. The Granthakut styled temple was destroyed in the earthquake of 1934. After which, the ruling Rana clan had reconstructed the temple in Gumbaz style, a noted style of the Rana-era.
Following the dispute over the construction model, the government had, in December 2017, formed an 11-member committee to recommend the construction modality of the pond and the temple headed by former director general of Department of Archaeology Bishnu Raj Karki.
The committee recommended that the pond should be built in Malla-era design.
Following the recommendation, the pond is now being reconstructed in Malla-era design. Workers have completed the work on the embankment of the pond, and currently, they are filling the
bottom of the pond with black soil and topping the floor with traditional bricks as per the archaeological principles.
Reconstruction of the temple is also going on in full swing. National Reconstruction Authority said more than 35 per cent of the reconstruction work at the temple and the bridge that passes over the pond had been completed.
Raju Man Manandhar, archaeology consultant hired by the NRA to look after the project, said the reconstruction work was being carried out studying the remnants of the temple built in 1670.
“We are also studying the structures called Pratapur and Anantpur built in Granthakut style at Swoyambhu,” he added.
Authorities failed to meet the deadline for completing the construction of the pond several times in the past. “But this time we are very confident the temple and the pond will be constructed by mid-May,” Manandhar claimed.

Reconstruction of the historic Durbar High School has been completed.

The school building was built using modern construction materials, but its traditional look has been kept intact. The school building was originally built using mud, bricks, pulses and lime.
With the reconstruction of the high school, the construction company officials will monitor it and hand over the building to the government by mid-February.
Currently, decorative and other finishing works are being carried out on the premises of the school. Shanghai Construction was tasked with building the school with full support of the Chinese government.
The four-storey building has 40 rooms. A total of 100 workers were mobilised everyday for the construction. It took 19 months to complete the work.
Established in 1853 by the then prime minister Jung Bahadur Rana for educating only the children of the Rana family, the school was later opened for the children of common Nepalis in 1907. After introduction of the National Education System in 1973, the school has  been running under district education office.

The high Powered Bagmati Civilisation Integrated Development Committee is all set to assign the responsibility of cleaning up rivers to the concerned wards in Kathmandu Metropolitan City.
The committee’s governing board member Mala Kharel said they were preparing to give the responsibility to the wards concerned from January 25 when Bagmati Clean-up Mega Campaign enters the 350th week.
Kharel said Ward No 11 would be assigned the responsibility of cleaning the stretch of the Bagmati River that falls in the ward. Around 1,000 metre stretch of the river from Rudramati Dobhan at Babarmahal to Gushingal, Tripureshwor falls in Ward No 11. This stretch also includes the squatters’ settlement at Thapathali. KMC Ward 11 Chair Hiralal Tandukar said cleaning the Bagmati River near the squatters’ settlement at Thapathali was quite challenging. “We have already informed about this problem to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. We hope the problem will be resolved as the PM has also shown interest in keeping the river clean by managing the settlement,” he said. Cleaning the Bagmati River is challenging in this ward also because Rudramati and Ichhumati (Tukucha) rivulets, the tributaries of the Bagmati River, join the Bagmati in this area.
These two rivulets are highly polluted. Although Rudramati looks somewhat clean compared to Tukucha, the banks of the Rudramati near its confluence with Bagmati is littered and stinking. The Tukucha is heavily polluted and has been encroached upon at many locations.
A committee had been formed to investigateg the land grab along the banks of the Tukucha by unscrupulous people. But this committee is dormant and has not been able to carry out its work for decades now.
Meanwhile, four metric tonne waste was removed from the Bagmati River in Tripureshwar area today as Bagmati Clean-up Campaign entered the 349th week. More than 350 ‘Clean Bagmati’ campaigners from 18 different organisations participated in the campaign today. Nepali Army, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force personnel also joined hands for the cause.
Similarly, the Bagmati River below Gothatar bridge was cleaned today as part of the 311th week of cleaning the Bagmati upstream from Guheshwari. Fifty volunteers cleaned the Bagmati at this location. Bagmati Clean-up Mega Campaign was initiated on 19 May 2013. A campaign to clean the tributaries of the Bagmati and the Ring Road area was also launched following the drive.

The activists also want the government to ensure easy public access to the Nepali Army-occupied part of Tundikhel.
Khula Manch, which once used to be one of the major venues for all kinds of political campaigns, has remained neglected since the 2015 earthquakes. Khula Manch has also been occupied by various government supported development projects.

The Government of Nepal has outlawed a number of ill practices including chhaupadi (menstrual seclusion), dowry, witchcraft allegations and child marriage, but the enforcement remains weak and these deeply entrenched practices continue unabated, according to World Report-2020 published by the New York-based Human Rights Watch earlier this week.
According to the report, legal gap and lack of political will continue to mar accountability for sexual violence, specially for victims from minority communities. A statute of limitation of one year on rape and sexual violence allegations prevents many cases from being filed at the courts. Despite numerous protests, the government has failed to adopt policies to protect and provide justice for women and girls, specially those from minority communities, who face rape and sexual violence. Instead, numerous cases are mishandled by authorities, including that of a 15-year-old Dalit girl from Mahottari, who was murdered after rape at the end of 2018 and the police refused to register the case in 2019.
There is no comprehensive legislation banning gender discrimination. Article 11 of the constitution confers fundamentally inferior legal status on women, by preventing them from passing citizenship to their children according to the same terms as Nepali men. In November 2018, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women recommended Nepal to endorse Safe Schools Declaration, an international commitment to protect schools, teachers and students during armed conflict. The government has yet to ratify the international instrument.
“Caste and ethnic minorities remained more vulnerable than others to abuses, including excessive use of force by police and torture in police custody. Crime, such as sexual violence, against members of minority communities often go unreported. After studying a case brought to the United Nations Human Rights Committee by a member of an indigenous group, who had suffered forced labour and torture, the committee recommended that Nepal must remove obstacles that stand on the way of victims seeking justice,” it reads.
Survivors of natural disasters, such as flooding, who disproportionately belong to minority communities, are often not provided with adequate relief, such as shelter. Four years after the 2015 earthquakes, which destroyed nearly one million homes, many survivors still live in temporary shelters. The government’s Public Service Commission sought to undermine constitutional guarantees of quotas for minority communities in civil service jobs by defying the hiring procedure.
According to the report, the government has also failed to publish the report of the Lal Commission, which investigated deadly violence between members of the minority communities and the police force in 2015. Despite progress in law and policy, tens of thousands of children with disabilities remain out of school, or are segregated at schools in different classrooms from other students, reads the report.

The Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers has approved short-term action plan for traffic management of Kathmandu valley.
As per the action plan, the Department of Roads and Metropolitan Traffic Police Division have already installed and operated traffic lights in Baneshwor, Singha Durbar, Gaushala, Maharajgunj, Kalimati, Tinkune Padmodayamod, Putalisadak, Bagbazaar, Old Baneshwor and Mitrapark.
Smart technology will be introduced in the valley within June. The DoR and MTPD will also install additional pedestrian lights in busy thoroughfares of the valley. The action plan has assigned Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Lalitpur Metropolitan City, DoR and other municipalities to maintain road cracks and fix potholes.
“The DoR will expand service lane on the left side of Koteshwor-Jadibuti road section and take necessary action to reduce traffic congestion in the area, besides constructing overhead bridge at appropriate locations,” the action plan reads. Bishnumati, Bagmati, Dhobikola, Manohara corridors will be managed to avoid traffic congestion. Nepal Oil Corporation and fuel tankers operators have been told not to supply petrol or diesel to fuel stations (petrol pumps) from 7:00am to 8:00pm for the purpose of reducing traffic jam.
“The petrol pumps, which are hampering traffic movement, will be asked to relocate somewhere else. Pick-up and drop-off points will be designated for public vehicles, while making it mandatory for school vehicles to enter their respective compound with 9:00am,” the action plan reads.
Concerned metropolitan cities will have to collect waste within 8:30am. “Right turn of the vehicles will be prohibited in underpass of bridges. Metropolitan cities will clear footpath of encroachment and take action against anyone, who piles up construction materials on the road,” it reads.
Railings will be constructed on either side of busy roads, besides marking zebra-crossing.
The action plan also envisages setting up a CCTV control room in MTPD to monitor traffic.
Portable overhead bridge will be installed at Koteshwor Chowk, Minbahwan, New Baneshwor, Babarmahal, Ramshahpath, Tripureshor, Kalimati Chowk, Airport Chowk, Thapathali Chowk and Chabahil Chowk within June.
The government will also adopt ‘zero tolerance’ policy against traffic rule violators, according to the action plan.
Traffic management has turned to be a daunting task due to inadequate traffic lights and other smart technologies in the valley. Moreover, roads in Kathmandu lack enough sidewalks and overhead bridges for pedestrians. As many as 254 persons were killed in road accidents in the valley in 2018- 19 compared to 194 in the previous fiscal. Around 33 per cent of the victims were pedestrians.
Road network of the valley has been extended from 1,319km in 1995 to 1,596km in 2016, which is a mere 20 per cent increase in the past 20 years.

Ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) co-chairs KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal today met for more than two hours in Baluwatar to discuss candidates for the post of speaker of the House of Representatives, but they could not agree on a specific candidate.
Prime Minister Oli’s Press Adviser Surya Thapa said the two leaders met for two-and-a-half hours to discuss candidates for speaker election, but Thapa did not reveal details of what actually transpired in the meeting. He said it was the continuation of yesterday’s meeting between the two leaders.
According to sources, the two leaders agreed to move ahead in line with the spirit of unification of the then CPN-UML and CPN-MC to form the NCP. This means, chances are higher that the new speaker will be elected from among lawmakers representing former CPN-MC, said the source.
“It is likely that the former CPN-MC will get the speaker’s post. However, the candidate has yet to be finalised,” the source said.
Dahal and Oli have been at odds for the past few weeks over speaker election, with both the leaders projecting their own favourites for the post. While Oli is backing former speaker Subas Chandra Nembang, Dahal is under pressure not to give up the speaker’s post allocated to the then CPN-MC during the unification. Dahal is in favour of either Pampha Bhusal or Agni Sapkota.
Moreover, Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahangphe has also staked her claim to the post. Last Saturday, the NCP secretariat had asked Tumbahangphe to resign, but she refused to put in her papers. She has said she will resign after the party finalises the candidate.
Of late, Dahal has projected Haribol Gajurel for the post that fell vacant with the arrest of Krishna Bahadur Mahara on the charge of attempt to rape in October. However, Gajurel told THT that the party had not discussed any such thing with him. “I too came to know about it through media reports. The party has not communicated to me any such thing. Let’s see what the party decides,” he said.
Oli-Dahal stand-off has led to the HoR meeting being postponed thrice this Bill Session, inviting wide criticism and condemnation from opposition parties and civil society members. The next House meeting has been slated for January 20.

The throat swab and blood sample of a Nepali suspected of being infected with corona virus, which develops severe acute respiratory illness and can even lead to death, will soon be sent to New Delhi or Hong Kong to confirm whether he has contracted the fatal disease.
The 32-year-old student, who recently returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan, was admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital on Monday after he complained of respiratory problems and inflammation in the throat. He had also complained of mild fever around 10 days ago.
“Since he had returned from Wuhan and had shown symptoms of severe acute respiratory illness, he was initially kept in an isolation ward in the hospital for further tests, as Wuhan had recently witnessed outbreak of pneumonia,” said Dr Anup Bastola, consultant, tropical medicine at STIDH.
The outbreak of pneumonia in China is believed to have been caused by a new strain of corona virus, which has already killed at least two people and affected at least 41 others in the country. Recently, Japan and Thailand have also confirmed the first cases of the virus.
As the disease was spreading in Asian countries, Nepali doctors had warned the outbreak could affect Nepalis as well. Around that time, the 32-year-old visited STIDH with symptoms akin to pneumonia that had spread in China. The patient is not in a serious condition now and was discharged today.
“But before he was discharged, doctors at STIDH collected his throat swab and blood sample. We are considering to send the samples to New Delhi or Hong Kong,” a source said. “The foreign laboratory will send the results within a week of receiving the sample.”
The decision to send the sample abroad was taken jointly by STIDH, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division of the government and the World Health Organisation, the source said.
The sample of the patient is being sent to India because Nepal does not have reagents to conduct a comprehensive test of the virus, say doctors.
“Reagents come in bulk and are expensive. Though we have a proper laboratory to test the sample and skilled manpower as well, we can’t perform the test here as we don’t have reagents. Basically such reagents are bought only when necessary,” said Dr Runa Jha, director at National Public Health Laboratory.
Laboratories need to spend around Rs 17,000 on reagents to conduct a test of the virus, according to Dr Jha. But since reagents are not sold in retail to conduct one or two tests, laboratories have to buy the chemical in bulk, with which at least 200 tests can be performed. Buying the reagents to perform at least 200 tests, according to doctors, can cost quite a lot and the chemical has a limited shelf life. Since the disease is rare for now in Nepal, doctors said buying reagents in bulk at the moment might not be necessary.

The government has decided to allow India to take home 173,072 kilogram red sandalwood from Nepal within 90 days. The precious wood was confiscated by Nepal Police while being smuggled to China from India via Nepal, over a period of one decade.
Speaking at a press conference organised in Singha Durbar to disclose the decisions of the January 13 Council of Ministers, Minister of Communications and Information Gokul Prasad Baskota said red sandalwood would be handed over to the concerned Indian authority through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as per Article VII of the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Control Act-2016.
Both Nepal and India are parties to the CITES, which has stipulated a provision of returning confiscated contraband to the country of origin.
“We have granted permission for India to take home the red sandalwood within 90 days.
The transportation cost for returning the precious wood will be borne by India,” said the minister. Red sandalwood is an aromatic tropical hardwood tree which is endemic to southern India. This species does not naturally grow in Nepal. The wood was confiscated from racketeers while being smuggled to China from India via Nepal.
The Ministry of Forests and Environment was having a hard time to manage the stash of red sandalwood seized from smugglers. At least four to five armed police personnel have been deployed to guard the red sandalwood on the premises of the Department of Forest in Babar Mahal. Earlier, government authorities had said they were ready to hand over the contraband to India, the country of origin, after necessary verification, in accordance with existing national and international laws.
The Cabinet decided to accept loan assistance of approximately Rs 12.76 billion to be provided by European Investment Bank for upgradation and extension of electricity grid and approve the Nepal-China mutual legal assistance treaty on criminal offence.
Minister Baskota said the government had also decided to increase the remuneration of local staffers working in Nepali missions abroad, acquire land for expansion and upgradation of Tamagadhi-Simraungadh road section in Birgunj, allow the Hetauda-Dhalkebar-Duhabi 400 kV Transmission Line Project to use 80.66 hectares of national forest area and formulate National Forensic Lab Operation Bill.
In yet another decision, the government will form a five-member talks team headed by the chief of Monitoring and Evaluation Division at the Ministry of Forests and Environment to negotiate with the World Bank regarding the payment to be received by Nepal with respect to carbon trade.

The government has allocated Rs 17.5 million to the MoWCSC to implement programs to enable senior citizens and persons with disabilities to live in the society independently and with dignity.
“Each province will be provided with grant amount of Rs 2.5 million through its Ministry of Social Development. The concerned province may contribute to the programme by allocating additional amount from its annual budget,” Section 4 of the procedure reads.
It requires provinces to spend the grant amount for land acquisition to establish villages for senior citizens and disabled persons; develop housing facilities having safety and health services; provide shelter for helpless children and disabled persons abandoned by family and provide medicines and other necessary assistive materials for senior citizens and disabled persons.

Around 80 per cent of the disabled people in the country are illiterate and 95 per cent are unemployed.
Nepal has been witnessing an increase in aging population.

Police said they had beefed up security across Kathmandu valley and at some government offices, following yesterday’s blast allegedly by Netra Bikram Chand-led Communist Party Nepal.
Chand-led CPN, outlawed by the government, had yesterday planted two bombs, one inside the house of Sobha Kanta Dhakal at Nagarjun Municipality and another inside Lalita Niwas, a high security zone. Police have not made any arrest in connection with the incidents, so far. Dhakal is one of the accused in the Lalita Niwas land grab case.
The bomb planted at Dhakal’s house went off causing minor damage to the house and the vehicle parked inside the garage, while the bomb planted at western corner of Lalita Niwas, near residential area was defused by Nepali Army last night.
The government imposed ban on all kinds of activities of the Chand-led CPN since March last year, following a blast by the outfit outside Ncell office in Nakkhu that killed one person. Police said they have arrested as many as 1,357 cadres of the Chand-led CPN ever since. Of those arrested, cases on various charges were field at different courts against 1,200 persons while rest of them were released after inquiry.

Shree Krishna Giri, vice-chairman of the Medical Education Commission had yesterday filed an application with the Metropolitan Police Range, Bhaktapur, seeking security, citing threat to his life from Prasain. The Bhaktapur District Administration Office issued Giri’s arrest warrant today, said police.
Organising a press conference on January 8, Prasain had charged Giri of demanding Rs 200 million from him for granting affiliation to his medical college, at a meeting held at Dwarika’s Hotel.
According to Prasain, Giri had demanded 10 per cent share of his medical college if he could not give him the money.
Organising a separate press meet on the same day, Giri had refuted the charges saying that the charges levelled against him were baseless, misleading and condemnable.
Prasain had filed a case against Giri at the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority and the Department of Money Laundering Investigation for earning disproportionate property on January 15. Bhaktapur Chief District Officer Humakala Pandey refused to comment on the issue.
Senior Superintendent of Police Sabin Pradhan, head of Bhaktapur Police said police were looking for Prasain. “We have deployed our police team to arrest Prasain, who is on the run,” SP Pradhan said.

Kathmandu, January 16
Amnesty International has said Information Technology Bill, Media Council Bill and Mass Communication Bill will curtail freedom of expression and Nepal’s Parliament must amend these bills in conformity with international instruments.
IT Bill will empower the government to arbitrarily censor online content, including social media, and punish offenders with up to five years’ imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1.5 million.
The IT Bill is one of the three proposed new legislation that uses vague and broad clauses to unduly restrict the right to freedom of expression, said AI in a press statement.
“Nepal was once envied by people across the region for its openness towards critical views and opinions. That reputation is now at risk as the government continues to curtail people’s expression through writing and singing. The IT Bill and other legislation must be amended and brought into line with international law and standards to guarantee people’s right to freedom of expression,” said Biraj Patnaik, South Asia Director of Amnesty International.
AI said in 2019, laws like the Electronic Transactions Act-2006, were used to arbitrarily detain journalists for publishing stories which criticised the government or others who posted critical comments online.
In April, journalist Arjun Giri was charged under the act for reporting on financial fraud. In June, comedian Pranesh Gautam was arrested for posting a satirical film review on YouTube. In October, musical artists Durgesh Thapa and Samir Ghishing, popularly known as VTEN, were arrested for the contents of their songs.
Section 94 of the IT Bill vaguely criminalises people, who post content on social media if it is deemed to be against “national unity, self-respect, national interest and relationship between federal units.”
AI said other provisions of the IT Bill, which are open to wide interpretation, could also be abused to stifle critical opinion, satire, public dialogue, and public comments. For example, the bill prohibits ‘teasing,’ ‘deceiving,’ ‘demotivating’ and ‘demeaning.’
Section 115 of the bill envisions ‘Information Technology Court’ in each seven provinces around the country, with the mandate to deal with all issues under the bill, including criminal liability.
As the bill authorises the government to appoint members of the court bypassing the judicial council, this poses serious concern on the influence of the executive body over these courts, independence of the judiciary and fair trails in such courts, AI said in its release.
Under international human rights law, states are permitted to limit the right to freedom of expression, but these limitations must be for legitimate reason, as stipulated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nepal is a party, AI said in its release.
“If passed in its current form, the provisions in the IT Bill further risk creating a chilling effect, and will ultimately give rise to censorship of online content and people will no longer be able to share their feelings or debate issues freely and without fear of repression,” said Patnaik.
AI said under Section 18 of the Media Council Bill, the government will have the power to impose fine of up to one million rupees if a journalist is found guilty of libel or defamation, which is also punishable under the criminal code.
AI said Mass Communication Bill, also drafted in 2019, includes provision of even harsher sentencing and fines to journalists with up to 15 years of imprisonment if found guilty of publishing or b r o a d c a s t i n g c o n t e n t s deemed to be against sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity, as per section 59 of the bill.

Bir Hospital is yet to instal a tomotherapy machine purchased in 2018 for Rs 400 million.
Protracted delay in installing the machine has deprived thousands of cancer patients of service.
The machine was purchased by the hospital after its cobalt machine, which was used to provide radiation therapy for cancer patients, stopped working.

The hospital has stopped providing radiation therapy for the past four years forcing thousands of cancer patients to visit private hospitals, according to Dr Bibek Acharya, head of department of clinical oncology at Bir Hospital. The new machine was bought considering the increasing number of cancer patients at the hospital.
“The new machine needs a proper place for installation. It should be placed in a bunker covering wide space. We will use the same room, where the old machine was kept to install the new machine as we don’t have extra space. There has been a problem in disposing the old machine. The machine should be disposed in the same country from where it was purchased. The process for its disposal has begun. We will be sending the machine to Germany,” said Dr Kedar Century, director at Bir Hospital.
The new machine is currently kept at Nepal Armed Police Force Hospital, Balambu, according to Dr Century.
“Renovation of the room meant for its installation is ongoing.
It will take another four months to install the new machine,” said Dr Century.
Tomotherapy is a type of radiation therapy. The process combines treatment planning, CT image-guided patient positioning and treatment delivery into one integrated system.
Tomotherapy uses a single rotating beam of radiation.
With a single radiation beam, the highest possible dose of radiation is sent directly to the tumour. It allows physicians to adjust the radiation beam to precisely target the tumour of patient.
“The machine is helpful to treat cancer of brain and spinal cord. It also helps in preventing damage of tissues,” said Dr Acharya.
It is estimated that 30,000 cancer cases are diagnosed in the country every year. Of the total cancer patients, 16,000 need radiation therapy, according to Dr Acharya.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong protesters marched through shopping malls on New Year’s Eve urging people not to give up the fight for democracy in 2020, while police were out in force across the city to quell any unrest.
As evening fell, dozens of protesters dropped flowers near the Prince Edward metro station, which was the scene of some of the most violent clashes with the police this summer.
Demonstrators plan a giant human chain later on as well as late-night demonstrations dubbed “Suck the Eve” in the downtown bar and entertainment district of Lan Kwai Fong and the picturesque Victoria Harbour.
Wong, a 22-year-old freelance photographer who gave only his last name, said he did not feel like celebrating New Year.
“I can’t even celebrate my birthday. I choose to stand here because at least we can chant a little and it feels like I’m with family,” he said.
The protests began in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, and have evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.
Many streets were decorated with Christmas lights and other seasonal paraphernalia, but the mood on Tuesday was less than festive as officers in riot gear patrolled the busiest areas.
In a prime shopping mall in the Tsim Sha Tsui area popular with tourists, dozens of protesters chanted pro-democracy slogans and riot police stopped people to search their backpacks.
Authorities have cancelled the popular midnight fireworks for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns.
The fireworks usually draw thousands of locals and tourists to the harbour front and the countdown is broadcast worldwide.
They will be replaced with “Symphony of Lights”, a multimedia light show involving projections on the city’s tallest skyscrapers at the stroke of midnight.
The facade of the waterside Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre was turned into a giant countdown clock.
“Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time is my New Year wish,” said 30-year-old Calvin, who attended a central lunchtime rally.
CARRIE LAM’S RESOLUTION
In a New Year’s Eve video message, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said more than six months of unrest in the Asian financial hub had caused sadness, anxiety, disappointment and rage.
“Let’s start 2020 with a new resolution, to restore order and harmony in society. So we can begin again, together,” said Lam in the 3-minute address.
“Hong Kong people have resolved many difficulties before. With our resilience and wisdom I believe we can once again overcome our current challenges and rebuild Hong Kong.”
Police say they have arrested nearly 6,500 people since the protests began escalating in what is the worst political crisis faced by the city in decades.
On Jan. 1, tens of thousands of people are expected to join a major pro-democracy march, after it received police approval to proceed.
The previous such march by organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), in early December, drew an estimated 800,000 people.
The New Year demonstrations follow a pick-up in clashes since Christmas Eve, when riot police fired tear gas at thousands of protesters following scuffles in shopping malls and in a prime tourist district.
“On New Year’s Day, we need to show our solidarity … to resist the government. We hope Hong Kong people will come onto the streets for Hong Kong‘s future,” said CHRF leader Jimmy Sham.

HONG KONG: Hundreds of protesters marched through Hong Kong shopping malls on Thursday, disrupting business in the Asian financial hub for a third day over the festive period and prompting riot police to close off a mall in a tourist district.
The “shopping protests” have targeted malls across the Chinese-ruled city since Christmas Eve, turning violent at times with police firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators in areas filled with shoppers and visitors.
While the turnout on Thursday was smaller than on the previous two days, riot police stepped up patrols at shopping centers on the Kowloon peninsula and in the rural New Territories.
Dozens of police with batons and shields surrounded and sealed off the Langham Place shopping mall in Kowloon’s Tsim Sha Tsui district after black-clad, masked protesters occupied it.
“I think the purpose for us to come out is to… let people realize that so many front-line protesters sacrificed (things) for them. They should not forget and (simply) celebrate Christmas,” said Sandy, a young demonstrator who wore a black mask to hide her identity.
“…We have been fighting for almost seven months now, and the Hong Kong police have done so many bad things.”
The protests began more than six months ago in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
They have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement, and became more confrontational over the festive season. Earlier in December, after pro-democracy candidates overwhelmingly won district council elections, they had been largely peaceful.
Many protesters have been angered by what they see as the use of unnecessary force by the police, and demanded an independent inquiry into the force’s behaviour.
Police, who say they have used only minimum force to control the protests, on Thursday detained several people at a mall in rural Tai Po, north of the city’s financial center, public broadcaster RTHK said.
Demonstrators are also angry at what they perceive as increased meddling by Beijing in freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering, saying it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula put in place at that time, and blames foreign forces for fomenting unrest.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam condemned the protesters in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying many Hong Kongers and tourists were disappointed their Christmas Eve celebrations had been ruined, while local businesses had also been hit.
On Thursday, some restaurants and stores pulled down their shutters in the malls as protesters, some wearing balaclavas and carrying black flags, marched by.
The government on Thursday criticized “unprecedented violence” by some protesters, but said that protecting freedoms and human rights remained a top priority.

The magnitude 6.1 quake was centred in mountainous Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan, at a depth of 210 km (130 miles), the US Geological Survey said.
Officials in Kabul said they were assessing damage in areas around the sparsely populated epicentre. In Pakistan, tremors shook furniture and power cable poles. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Waseem Ahmad, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority in Islamabad, estimated the quake to be about 6.4 magnitude.
“I was with my kids at a badminton court when we felt strong jolts,” said Nusrat Jabeen in Pakistan‘s capital. “It was very scary. We felt everything was shaking. We ran out for safety.”
Tremors were also felt in India’s mountainous Kashmir state where people rushed out of their homes and offices. The Indian subcontinent has suffered some of the largest earthquakes in the world.

159,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/veteran-climbers-skeptical-that-proposed-rules-for-mount-everest-will-stop-deaths/,"
KATHMANDU: Veteran climbers of Mount Everest are skeptical that proposed new regulations by the Nepalese government to tighten the permit process for adventurers will address the root causes of this year’s heavy death toll on the world’s tallest peak.
American mountaineers Ed Viesturs and Alan Arnette said planned new laws – if they are introduced at all – are unlikely to tackle the growing trend of inexperienced climbers rushing in packs to scale the 29,035-foot (8,850-metre) Himalayan peak.
“I’ve seen this movie so many times it’s totally predictable,” Arnette told Reuters in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “Every year since 2013, something goes wrong and they (the Nepal government) announce all these new rules and never implement them.”
Eleven climbers died on Mount Everest this year – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side. Many perished when a rush to climb the mountain during a short window of suitable weather in late May led to a “traffic jam” near the summit.
“Most teams opt to go for the summit when the first weather window is predicted,” Viesturs told Reuters in one of a series of interviews by phone and email.
“Everyone is afraid of missing what might be the one and only perfect day. There are typically several good summit days, but there’s pressure to go when everyone else goes.”
Nepal has traditionally issued climbing permits to anyone prepared to pay the $11,000 fee, handing out a record 381 passes this year. With essential Sherpas and guides added, more than 800 people were trying to reach the summit during the short weather window.
TRAFFIC JAM IN THE DEATH ZONE
The overcrowding – which caught worldwide attention when a photograph of a queue of climbers stepping over bodies to reach the summit went viral – caused fatal delays in the thin air in what is known as the “death zone” above 8,000 metres. That raised concerns that inexperienced mountaineers were being encouraged to attempt the climb by unscrupulous guide companies.
Among the changes proposed by the Nepalese government is a requirement for climbers to submit a medical report by a certified doctor disclosing their history and state of health. Another suggested requirement was the climbers submit proof they had scaled another 6,500-metre peak in Nepal.
Arnette said the first change was unlikely to be enough, given the potential to forge medical documents, while the second made little sense as many climbers have scaled higher peaks elsewhere.
The recommendations have been submitted to the cabinet for approval, Mira Acharya, who oversees climbing activities for the Nepal government’s Department of Tourism, told Reuters last week. The government has not given a time frame for the introduction of new laws.
Viesturs, who has an extensive history on Everest, said the proposed changes did not do enough to tackle the “group think” pack mentality that led to the traffic jam in late May, a problem he said also needed to be addressed by climb leaders at base camp.
“I know several climbers who waited until later and had the mountain almost to themselves,” Viesturs said of this year’s climbing season. “We really need to answer why so many people are on the summit ridge on the same day? How can you control it?”

160,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/charity-sues-kenya-over-treatment-of-trafficked-indian-nepali-women/,"NAIROBI: A charity said on Monday it is suing the Kenyan government over a failure to provide five women trafficked from India and Nepal for sexual exploitation with appropriate care after they were rescued.
HAART Kenya said a decision to make the three Nepali and two Indian women rescued from a Nairobi bar in August stay and testify against their alleged traffickers had caused them psychological harm.
“After four months, the victims just want to go home. They have become deeply traumatised and suicidal … some have been hospitalised,” said Sophie Otiende, programme consultant for HAART Kenya, which has rented a safe house for the victims.
“So we have filed a complaint against the government so that all victims of trafficking are not compelled to testify, and the government pays for their speedy and safe repatriation.”
The government has said it hopes to repatriate the five women, aged in their early to mid-twenties, in the coming days.
The petition, due to be heard on Tuesday, states that Kenya’s attorney general, inspector general of police and director of public prosecutions violated an anti-trafficking law that says victims have a right to privacy and safe repatriation.
It also calls on authorities to pay expenses of more than 1.3 million Kenyan shillings ($12,830) incurred by the charity for the care of the victims, which the law says is the state’s responsibility.
Kenyan government officials denied a lack of care and said no request for funds had been received.
“We have received requests from other charities which are being considered. If HAART approached us, we would of course consider providing funds for these victims,” said Elizabeth Mbuka, Head of the Counter Trafficking in Persons Secretariat.
Mbuka said a court order for the repatriation of the five women had now been given.
BOLLYWOOD BARS
A rising number of women and girls are leaving South Asian nations such as Nepal, India and Pakistan to work in Bollywood-style dance bars in Kenya’s adult entertainment industry – many illegally – according to anti-trafficking activists and police.
There is no official data, but the results of police raids combined with figures on repatriation of rescued women suggest scores of women and underage girls are victims of organised human trafficking from South Asia to Kenya.
Common in India, so-called mujra dance bars – where young women dance to Bollywood music for money from male patrons – have mushroomed in cities including Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, where large numbers of Kenyans of South Asian descent live.
Police and anti-trafficking groups have repeatedly voiced concerns that some of these private clubs are used as a front to ensnare women and girls, some in sex slavery, with women forced to pay off loans by erotic dancing or having sex with clients.
An official from the Indian High Commission in Nairobi said there had been “a few” cases involving the trafficking of Indian women to Kenyan dance bars.
“Whenever there is a case, we request consular access and provide whatever support we can to the victims,” said the official, who did not want to be named.
“We try to ensure that all Indian nationals go back as soon as possible, but we can only do this when the court orders this in the host country.”

TIRANA/THUMANE: At least 13 people were killed when the most powerful earthquake to hit Albania in decades shook the capital Tirana and the country’s west and north on Tuesday, tearing down buildings and burying residents under rubble.
Residents, some carrying babies, fled apartment buildings in Tirana and the western port of Durres after the 6.4 magnitude quake struck shortly before 4 a.m. (0300 GMT).
In the northern town of Thumane, Marjana Gjoka, 48, was sleeping in her apartment on the fourth floor of a five-storey building when the quake shattered the top floors.
“The roof collapsed on our head and I don’t know how we escaped. God helped us,” said Gjoka, whose three-year-old niece was among four people in the apartment when the quake struck.
The quake was centred 30 km (19 miles) west of Tirana, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said, and was also felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia.
Hours later a magnitude 5.4 earthquake hit Bosnia, with an epicentre 75 km (45 miles) south of Sarajevo, monitors said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
Five people were found dead in the rubble of apartment buildings in the northern Albanian town of Thumane and a man died in the town of Kurbin after jumping out of a building, a Defence Ministry spokeswoman said.
Seven bodies were pulled from collapsed buildings in Durres, the main port and tourism destination, the Defence Ministry said, adding 39 had been pulled out alive from under the ruins.
Defence Minister Olta Xhacka said 135 people were injured.
Firefighters, police and civilians were removing the debris from collapsed buildings in Thumane. Most of the buildings that collapsed were built of bricks, a Reuters reporter said.
Rescuers in Thumane used a mechanical digger to claw at collapsed masonry and remove a tangle of metal and cables. Others groped with bare hands to clear rubble.
Two people were pulled from rubble in Thumane four hours after the quake, a Reuters reporter said. Doctors said they were in a bad condition.
“Everything at home kept falling down,” Refik, a Tirana resident, said of the impact on his sixth-floor apartment.
“We were awake because of the previous quakes, but the last one shook us around,” he told Reuters, referring to smaller tremors recorded in the hour before the main quake.
Rescuers told local media one of the dead was an elderly woman who saved her grandson by cradling him with her body.
TRAPPED
Xhacka said the quake’s epicentre was in Durres. It was followed by 100 aftershocks.
“Durres and Thumane are the areas worst hit. Rescue-and-save work continues in the collapsed buildings there,” she said as troops pulled a victim from a hotel in Durres.
At least 135 people were injured, with 72 hospitalized, Xhacka said. Two planes from fellow NATO-member Romania were expected to land with specialized search and rescue equipment and help was coming from Italy and Turkey, Xhacka said.
Greece had sent emergency services for search and rescue operations, its premier’s office said.
“Firefighters and army staff are helping residents under the rubble”, in Durres and Thumane, the Defence Ministry said.
An unidentified man, with a wound dressing on his right cheek, told News24 TV his daughter and niece were among those trapped in a collapsed apartment building in Durres.
“I talked with my daughter and niece on the phone. They said they are well and are waiting for the rescue. Could not talk to my wife. There are other families, but I could not talk to them,” the man said.
Located along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, between Greece and Macedonia, Albania experiences regular seismic activity.
An earthquake of 5.6 magnitude shook the country on Sept. 21, damaging around 500 houses and destroying some. The Defence Ministry had said it was the most powerful quake in Albania in the last 30 years.
The images of collapsed buildings in urban areas suggested Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than one in 1979 which razed a neighbourhood of a northern town. Neither of those two earlier earthquakes caused fatalities.
The Balkan nation is the poorest country in Europe, with an average income of less than a third of the European Union average, according to Eurostat data.

SYDNEY: Firefighters battled hundreds of bushfires across Australia on Thursday as scores of blazes sprang up in new locations, triggering warnings that it was too late for some residents to evacuate.
As Thick smoke blanketed the most populous city of Sydney for a third day, residents were urged to keep children indoors, stepping up pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to tackle climate change.
By early afternoon, dozens of fires were burning across the southeastern state of Victoria and temperatures of 40.9 Celsius (105.6 F) in Melbourne, its capital, matched the hottest day on record in 1894, Australia‘s weather bureau said.
Authorities warned residents of towns about 50 km (31 miles) north of Ballarat, the state’s third largest city, that it was too late for them to evacuate safely.
“You are in danger, act now to protect yourself,” fire authorities said in an alert. “It is too late to leave. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately.”
Blazes across several states have endangered thousands of people, killing at least four people this month, burning about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroying more than 400 homes.
The early arrival and severity of the fires in the southern hemisphere spring follows three years of drought that experts have linked to climate change and which have left bushland tinder-dry.
With 10 days remaining to the official start of summer, extreme temperatures and high winds have sparked wildfires in new areas, even as firefighters tracked the crisis across the mainland, the Northern Territory and the island of Tasmania.
In Victoria, power to more than 100,000 homes was knocked out amid lightning strikes and strong, gusty winds of more than 110 kph (68 mph) that knocked tree branches into power lines, ahead of a cool change expected to bring relief in the evening.
The extensive damage was likely to leave some customers without power through the night as utilities worked to restore networks and fix downed powerlines, a spokeswoman for power provider Ausnet said.
State authorities issued its first Code Red alert in a decade, signifying the worst possible bushfire conditions, warning that should a fire start it would be fast moving, unpredictable and probably uncontrollable.
In the state of New South Wales, strong winds blew smoke from 60 fires still burning over much of Sydney, shrouding the harbour city and its famous landmarks in thick smog.
The state imposed tough new water curbs in Sydney from Dec. 10, when a key dam is expected to be down to 45% capacity. Residents face fines if they use hoses to water their gardens and wash their cars.
CLIMATE POLITICS
The unrelenting conditions have sharpened attention on the climate change policies of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who rejected any link.
“Climate change is a global phenomenon, and we’re doing our bit as part of the response to climate change,” Morrison told ABC radio.
“To suggest that, with just 1.3% of global emissions, that Australia doing something differently – more or less – would have changed the fire outcome this season, I don’t think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all.”
Morrison’s conservative government has committed to the Paris Agreement for a cut in emissions from 26% to 28% by 2030, versus 2005 levels. Critics say current projections suggest it will miss that target and have urged remedial steps.

163,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/singapore-court-to-hear-legal-challenges-on-gay-sex-ban/,"KUALA LUMPUR: As a Singapore court prepares to hear a series of legal challenges to a law that bans gay sex, LGBT+ activists on Tuesday called for the “right” verdict to be delivered so similar reforms can be triggered across other parts of Asia.
Like many other former British colonies, Singapore has retained an old law that criminalises gay sex, which was scrapped by India in a landmark court ruling last year to give a boost to LGBT+ rights.
Empowered by the Indian ruling, three Singaporean activists have launched separate bids in a renewed push to decriminalise gay sex in the city-state, where a high court is due to begin hearing their cases on Wednesday.
“I think public opinion is pretty clear across religious and age segments that homosexuality should not be a criminal offence,” Johnson Ong Ming, who was among the trio, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Ong, a DJ also known as DJ Big Kid, was the first to launch the case in September last year. The former head of a LGBT+ rights charity and a retired doctor also filed similar lawsuits later.
“I have full confidence in our judicial system and I am hopeful that the court will come to the right decision … and overturn Section 377A,” Ong said by email.
The court has set aside six days in November for the legal challenges to be heard but it is unclear when the proceedings will wrap up.
Under Section 377A of Singapore’s Penal Code, a man found to have committed an act of “gross indecency” with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare. The law does not apply to homosexual acts between women.
Singapore has emerged as a modern nation since independence six decades ago but socially it remains conservative, partly due to sensitivities stemming from multi-religious groups among its 5.6 million population.
Previous legal challenges to overturn the ban have failed, although recent opinion polls indicated there has been growing support for gay rights.
Opposition to gay marriage had fallen to 60%, down from 74% in 2013, according to a poll of more than 4,000 people published in May by the Institute of Policy Studies, a Singapore think-tank.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong however has previously said that Singapore society “is not that liberal on these matters”.
The Singapore court cases are being closely watched by LGBT+ groups in some other parts of Asia that have maintained the colonial-era law, including in Myanmar and Malaysia.
“If the decision in Singapore goes our way, then it will boost our morale here in Malaysia,” said Numan Afifi, president of the LGBT+ advocacy Pelangi Campaign in Malaysia.
Aung Myo Min, executive director from the Yangon-based Equality Myanmar LGBT+ campaign group said both Singapore and Myanmar “should follow the example of India” and repeal the archaic law.
Gay sex is a crime in both countries, with those convicted facing sentences of up to 10 years in jail in Myanmar and 20 years in Malaysia.

164,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/at-least-40-killed-as-fresh-protests-engulf-iraq-3/,"BAGHDAD: At least 40 protesters were killed in Iraq on Friday when security forces used tear gas and an Iranian-backed militia opened fire to try to quell renewed demonstrations against corruption and economic hardship, security sources said.

A government intelligence officer and a member of the powerful Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia were killed in a clash with protesters in the southern city of Amara, police sources said.
More than 2,000 people were injured nationwide, according to medical sources and the Iraqi High Commission on Human Rights (IHCHR), as demonstrators vented frustration at political elites they say have failed to improve their lives after years of conflict.
“All we want are four things: jobs, water, electricity, and safety. That’s all we want,” said 16-year-old Ali Mohammed who had covered his face with a T-shirt to avoid inhaling tear gas, as chaotic scenes overwhelmed Baghdad‘s central Tahrir Square.
Sirens wailed and tear gas canisters landed amid groups of young protesters draped in Iraqi flags and chanting “with life and blood we defend you Iraq.”
The bloodshed is the second major bout of violence this month. A series of clashes two weeks ago between protesters and security forces left 157 people dead and over 6,000 wounded.
The unrest has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which lived through foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State (IS) insurgency between 2003 and 2017. It is the biggest challenge to security since IS was declared beaten.
On Friday, eight protesters were killed in Baghdad, the IHCHR said. At least five of them were protesters struck by tear gas canisters, security sources said.
In the south, at least nine protesters were killed when members of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) militia opened fire on protesters who tried to set fire to the group’s office in the city of Nasiriya, according to security sources.
Eight people were killed in Amara city, including six protesters, one AAH member and one intelligence officer, police sources said. Three protesters were killed in oil-rich Basra, one in Hilla, and one in Samawa, security sources said.
In Diwaniya city, twelve protesters died after being trapped in a burning building, morgue officials and police sources said.
The building, which housed the local offices of the Iran-backed Badr Organisation, was apparently torched by protesters unaware that others were already inside.
Interior Ministry spokesman Khalid al-Muhanna said at least 68 members of the security forces were injured.
The sometimes violent demonstrations erupted in Baghdad on October 1 and spread to southern cities.
They pose the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi since he took office just a year ago. Despite promising reforms and ordering a broad cabinet reshuffle, he has so far struggled to address the protesters’ discontent.
POVERTY, DESPITE OIL WEALTH
Despite the OPEC member country’s vast oil wealth, many Iraqis live in poverty, have limited access to clean water, electricity, basic healthcare or decent education as the country tries to recover from years of conflict and economic hardship.
Many Iraqis view the elite as subservient to one or other of Iraq’s two main allies, the United States and Iran. Many suspect these powers use Iraq to pursue their struggle for regional influence via proxies unconcerned with ordinary people’s needs.
“They hit us last night and again this morning. We don’t have any demands anymore, we want the government toppled,” said demonstrator Salah Mohammad.
“We want Iran to take its parties and leave, America to take its parties and leave, and let the Iraqi people decide.”
In Basra, Reuters footage showed protesters clashing with security forces who launched tear gas canisters and stun grenades and were met by rocks thrown at their vehicles. Young men carried the injured away, as protesters set police cars on fire.
An 8 pm curfew was imposed until further notice in the southern provinces of Basra, Muthanna, Wasit, Babel and Dhi Qar, after protesters torched offices of lawmakers, Shi’ite political parties and militia headquarters.
How the government and security forces handled Friday’s planned protests had been seen as a litmus test for the stability of the country with political leaders already on edge.
RAGE AGAINST THE ELITE
In a Thursday night address, Abdul Mahdi stressed that violence would not be tolerated and warned that any collapse of the government would drag Iraq into further turmoil.
Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who in recent weeks criticised the government’s handling of the protests, urged calm on all sides during his sermon on Friday.
In Baghdad, many demonstrators initially believed authorities would refrain from violence after security forces killed dozens of protesters earlier this month.
Hundreds tried throughout the day to march into the city’s fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies, when they were stopped by security forces.
By afternoon, the mood had shifted with thousands of angry protesters wrapped in Iraqi flags under pouring rain, chanting that they were peaceful and calling political leaders corrupt.
As clashes broke out, tuk-tuks carried the injured to hospitals. Medical sources told Reuters hundreds of people had been treated for injuries, most related to tear gas exposure.

AYODHYA: In the Indian town of Ayodhya, minority Muslims are feeling under siege as they await a Supreme Court ruling on a centuries-old religious dispute that has cast a shadow over their relations with the majority Hindu community.
After a tangle of legal cases, the Supreme Court in August decided to hear arguments every day in an effort to resolve the dispute over what should be built on the ruins of the 16th-century Babri Masjid, destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992.
The uproar over the mosque triggered some of India‘s deadliest riots, in which nearly 2,000 people, most of them Muslim, were killed.
The bloody controversy raised lingering questions about the role of religion in the officially secular country, and the place of Muslims in it.
Last month, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi finished the hearings and is expected to pronounce his verdict in the next couple of weeks.
Whichever way it goes, the decision is likely to have a significant impact on the fraught relationship between India‘s Hindus and Muslims, who constitute 14% of its 1.3 billion people.
While most Muslim religious leaders want the mosque to be rebuilt, Hindus say there is evidence there was a temple on the site before the mosque was built in 1528 by a commander of Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty.
Construction of a “grand temple” in Ayodhya has long been an election promise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won a second term with a landslide this year.
Fearing tension after the court decision, Mohammed Shahid, 48, the grandson of the mosque’s last Imam, or prayer leader, has decided to move his family away.
He has reason to be afraid.
Shahid’s father, Mohammed Shabir, was killed by a mob of Hindus who rampaged through Ayodhya before tearing down the mosque on Dec. 6, 1992.
“In 1992, we decided to stay put – a decision that we live to regret,” Shahid said, sitting in the courtyard of his run-down, two-storied house.
“Other than killing my father, they set ablaze our house and a sawmill, our only source of income.”
‘BAD ELEMENTS’
Shahid said he was glad that his grandfather, who had died in 1990, did not see the destruction of the mosque.
Unlike Shahid, Haji Mahboob Ahmad, a 66-year-old Muslim community leader who lives near the site, doesn’t plan to leave.
But he shares Shahid’s anxiety.
“We’re conscious of the fact that some bad elements can try to foment trouble by taking advantage of the situation and that’s why I’ve requested authorities to ensure the safety of Ayodhya’s Muslims,” Ahmad said.
Ahmad said India‘s founding fathers established it as a secular democracy, and it must remain that.
The day Shahid’s father was killed, Hindu Hajari Lal, 57, escaped death.
Lal was among the hundreds of Hindus who destroyed the mosque with shovels, hammers and their bare hands, bringing down its domes before the whole structure collapsed.
Unfortunately for Lal, part of the building fell on him, trapping him in the rubble with broken bones.
“Since that fateful day of 1992, the only objective of my life is to see a permanent temple on the site. I can die in peace if I get to see the temple,” Lal said.
‘ENDLESSLY WAITING’
For Hindus, Lal said, the site in Ayodhya was as sacred as Mecca is in Islam.
That’s because Lal and millions of other Hindus believe the mosque was built at the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities.
Lal helps to guide a steady stream of pilgrims who come to see a model of what they hope will become a new temple.
Visitors can also look at an open field of masonry, in pink sandstone, including piles of ornately carved columns. Concrete pillars and blocks for foundations are also ready.
“Once the court green-lights construction of the temple, we can quickly move these concrete blocks from the workshop to the temple site,” said Sharad Sharma, spokesman for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council.
Top politicians, including some cabinet ministers, regularly visit Ayodhya to pay their respect to Nritya Gopal Das, an influential monk and chairman of a trust committed to building the temple.
“I’m sure Modi ji is aware of the sentiments of millions of Hindus who have been endlessly waiting to see the Ram temple,” said Das, using an honorific for Modi.

Canada named top country for social entrepreneurs
United States suffers biggest fall amid political uncertainty
More youth interest in working for businesses that do good



LONDON: Canada was named the best country for business leaders seeking to tackle social problems in a global poll on Tuesday while the United States fell from top slot due to political uncertainty.
Australia came second in the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s second global survey on the best countries for social entrepreneurs, seeing the biggest gain of 24 places from the inaugural poll in 2016, while France came third.
Mexico came last, down 15 places from 2016, but the United States was the biggest loser, plunging to 32nd place from No. 1, with the poll of about 900 social enterprise experts pointing to difficulties with government policy and access to investment.
Francois Bonnici, head of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, said over the past three years there had been “some amazing gains and some ongoing challenges” for social entrepreneurs addressing issues from climate change to refugees.
“Governments are recognising that to meet their own agendas this is a group of citizens and entrepreneurs that actually want to improve society and the environment,” said Bonnici.
“But it has a slightly different flavour in each country and that government role is important (as it) can legitimise the sector in their country by creating these policies.”
Business entrepreneurs globally are increasingly setting their sights on social problems with ventures that can be a commercial success while addressing problems like unemployment, homelessness, mental health, knife crime and even loneliness.
For example in South Africa social enterprise Harambee has created a ‘dating service’ to match unemployed youth with employers, while in India Project Patradya is tackling the waste problem by employing Afghan refugee women to make edible bowls.
But with little data on which nations were encouraging the sector, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in partnership with Deutsche Bank, began a poll in 2016 which was repeated in 2019. Social entrepreneurs, academics, investors and support agencies in the world’s 45 biggest economies, as ranked by the World Bank, were asked their views. Iran and Saudi Arabia were dropped in 2019 as it was impossible to get the right sample.
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
The 2019 poll found most experts, 82%, said social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum in their countries – although this was down three percentage points from 2016.
Canada, Indonesia and South Africa were named as the top countries where social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum, while Mexico, the United States and China saw the biggest falls.
Despite this, more than half of respondents – 54% – said the public still did not understand what they did which was not helped by the lack of a global definition of social enterprise. Italians were most aware of their work and Poles the least.
“People are becoming aware that the whole notion of social entrepreneurship is not just kumbaya,” said former Bangladeshi-U.S. investment banker Durreen Shahnaz, founder of the first social stock exchange, Impact Investment Exchange (IIX).
“It really is about doing serious work and making sure that work is scalable … There are signs the industry is maturing.”
The rising interest of young people – under the age of 25 – was a new finding, with three in four experts saying more young people were interested in working in social enterprises.
Indonesian social entrepreneur Denica Flesch wanted a career where she had a direct impact in the fight against poverty so in 2016, aged 26, she founded SukkhaCitta, an online marketplace selling clothes made by female artisans in Indonesian villages. “Young people are really challenging the notion of work, and combining purpose and career in one place,” said Flesch.
“They’re more idealistic and want to do something that’s beyond just looking for money.”
Canada was named as the top country where young people were playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs, followed by Germany and France, as well as the top place for women leaders.
WOMEN TAKING A LEAD
“Culturally we are about diversity and inclusion at a national level. That’s our brand, so that is helpful for the environment for social enterprise,” said Marcia Nozick, founder and chief executive of Vancouver-based social enterprise EMBERS.
She said policies that encouraged governments to buy the services of social impact ventures had been vital in helping the growth of EMBERS, which finds flexible jobs for people in a deprived part of Vancouver.
Nozick said there were many female leaders because it was “about caring and relationships and that has always been at the forefront of what women have brought to the business sector”.
Women were also seen as playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs in Australia, Belgium, Sweden and Malaysia.
The United States was named the worst place for female social entrepreneurs – the same as in 2016 – while Argentina and China slumped the most in questions regarding women in the poll conducted online and by telephone between May 7 and July 30.
The biggest falls for the United States overall related to access to investment, selling to businesses and supportive government policy.
Attracting investment continued to be a challenge, according to 56% of experts, down two percentage points from 2016.
Bonnie Chiu, founder and chief executive of Lensational, a social enterprise that trains marginalised women as photographers, said there was more capital available to social entrepreneurs but they had to jump through hoops to get it.
“So much time is spent chasing these opportunities,” said Chiu, whose business is based in Britain and Hong Kong.
“Traditional businesses just need to prove that they are financially sound, traditional charities just need to prove that they are generating social impact – but social enterprises need to do both.”
But regardless of the problems getting political support, financing or selling to businesses, experts said there would always be a need for social entrepreneurs to address the world’s largest problems where markets or public policy had failed.
“The more our political leaders might struggle to solve the world’s most pressing problems, the more opportunity for social entrepreneurs to come up with solutions,” said Jude O’Reilly, a senior director at U.S. nonprofit the Skoll Foundation.

OTTAWA: Canadians began voting on Monday to determine whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept into office four years ago as a charismatic figure promising “sunny ways,” will remain in power after two major scandals.
Polls opened in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland, with voting set to end in the Pacific Coast province of British Columbia at 7 p.m. (0200 GMT on Tuesday).
Trudeau, 47, the Liberal Party leader, was endorsed by former Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama in the final stretch of the campaign and is viewed as one of the last remaining progressive leaders among the world’s major democracies.
But he was shaken during the campaign by a blackface scandal and has been dogged by criticism of his handling of a corruption case involving a major Canadian construction company. Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has also had to overcome a sense of fatigue with his government.
Trudeau, accompanied by his wife and three children, voted in Montreal on Monday after a marathon sprint campaigning across the country in the past four days.
His Liberals and the main opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer are in a neck-and-neck race, according to opinion polls.
“The truth is it’s a coin toss right now,” said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker.
A year ago, no one would have predicted that Trudeau risked being the first prime minister since the 1930s to secure a parliamentary majority and then fail to win a second term.
The latest opinion polls suggest he may narrowly avert that result and could return to office with a minority in the 338-seat House of Commons. That would still leave Trudeau in a weakened position and needing the support of left-leaning opposition parties to push through key pieces of legislation.
The Canadian dollar was trading at a new three-month high on Monday, where “domestic attention is squarely on the 43rd federal election today,” said Shaun Osborne, chief market strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
“After some noise around the vote, we think FX players will refocus attention on the Bank of Canada policy outlook, the Fed and international backdrop pretty quickly,” he said.
Despite Scheer’s dimpled smile, Trudeau’s main rival has proven to be a determined opponent.
“He can’t even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he’s always wearing a mask,” Scheer said during a debate. “Mr. Trudeau, you are a phony and you are a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country.”
In his bid to unseat Trudeau, Scheer is also promising to balance the federal budget and eliminate a “carbon tax” on fossil fuels. Scheer, 40, is running his first campaign as party leader after winning a bitter Conservative leadership fight in 2017.
BUMPY CAMPAIGN RIDE
The six-week official campaign period has been a rough and meandering ride with dirty tactics on both sides.
The liberal image of Trudeau, who has championed diversity as prime minister and whose father opened up the country to mass immigration, took a severe blow when pictures emerged early in the campaign of him wearing blackface in the early 1990s and in 2001.
Trudeau had already been wrestling with the fallout from accusations he pressured his justice minister to help shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc from corruption charges. In August, a top watchdog said Trudeau breached ethics rules.
Given the fact that neither of the front-runners could come away with a parliamentary majority, it is the smaller left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) or the separatist Bloc Quebecois that could end up holding the balance of power.
“I am a lifelong Liberal voter and I am stumped on this one, mostly because I am really concerned about a Conservative win and just trying to figure out how to vote strategically,” said Kristin Street, 33, a strategy manager at a computer games company, in Port Moody, British Columbia.
EKOS Research pollster Frank Graves said Liberals needed turnout to be similar to four years ago or otherwise the Conservatives may have an edge.
“We may well be waiting until the final vote tallies in British Columbia to see who will win on Monday,” Graves said.

JAKARTA: Indonesian authorities said on Thursday more than 11,500 people have been evacuated from the town of Wamena in the easternmost province of Papua since dozens died during clashes last month in the area.
Located on the western half of the island of New Guinea and long racked by a simmering separatist insurgency, Papua encompasses Indonesia’s two easternmost provinces and has a distinct ethnic Melanesian population.
There has been a spike in protests and unrest since late August after Papuan students in Surabaya, Indonesia’s second city on the island of Java, were taunted and attacked by a mob chanting racial epithets over accusations they had desecrated a national flag.
In some of the worst bloodshed in decades in Papua, 33 people died and scores were hurt during clashes in Wamena on Sept. 23.
Government offices and homes were burned down, and 250 cars and motorcycles destroyed, as indigenous Papuans and security forces clashed.
The government and some Papuan independence activists say 25 of the 33 who died there were migrants from elsewhere in the country.
Erizal, 42, a former resident of Wamena who had left, said his child and wife died during the unrest and he now felt too traumatised to consider returning to the town.
“I am in my village in Padang now, maybe I will not return back to Wamena,” he said by telephone from the Padang area on Sumatra island where he was originally from.
He said his shop had also been burnt down in the unrest.
Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 2 Indonesia‘s air force had flown 7,467 people out of Wamena on Hercules planes, while 4,179 people had left on commercial flights, said Harry Hikmat, an official at Indonesia‘s social ministry.
Ahmad Musthofa Kamal, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said the situation in Wamane was now stable and that shops and markets were open again.
A former Dutch colony, Papua was formally incorporated into Indonesia in 1969, after a disputed vote of about 1,025 hand-picked tribal leaders. The result of the plebiscite was overseen and endorsed by the United Nations.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has opened the door to holding talks with separatists in Papua, a departure from the stance of previous governments and some of his cabinet ministers.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong police fired water cannon, rubber bullets and round after round of tear gas at petrol-bomb and brick-throwing protesters on Sunday in some of the most widespread violence in more than three months of anti-government unrest.
Running battles in the Causeway Bay shopping district, Wan Chai bar area and the Admiralty district of central government offices followed a night of showdowns with police in the Chinese-ruled city after a peaceful pro-democracy rally turned ugly on the streets outside.
More protests are planned in the run-up to China’s Oct. 1 National Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.
Police also fired tear gas from the roof of the Legislative Council building, which activists trashed and daubed with graffiti weeks ago.
Protesters, many of them wearing their trademark black with face masks, took cover from the tear gas behind umbrellas and held their ground on Sunday, some throwing tear gas canisters back at police as a helicopter flew overhead.
They built barricades with trolleys and trash cans and other debris. One threw a petrol bomb at police in the Wan Chai metro station.
At least one petrol bomb landed in the grounds of central government offices where several windows were smashed.
Police, who traditionally raise placards warning of retaliation before firing tear gas or firing water cannon, made several arrests, grappling people to the tarmac. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.
The water cannon fired blue dye, which elsewhere in the world is used to make identification of offenders easier.
The government said that the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, will be out of town for China’s National Day, despite her having sent out invitations for celebrations at home.
Some shops closed ahead of expected demonstrations, while the MTR metro service shut stations, a move that has made it a target of violence in the past.
Protesters shouted anti-China slogans and called for their “five demands, not one less” of the government, including universal suffrage and the dropping of all charges against their arrested colleagues.
About 200 China supporters dressed in red T-shirts gathered on top of Victoria Peak, overlooking the harbour, at around midday. They sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted “I love China”.
Angela, a housewife in her 40s, a Chinese flag sticker plastered on her cheek, said the pro-democracy protesters were “thugs”.
“If the government takes violent action I don’t object,” she said. “We have tolerated enough. I think I have emotional problems because of the riots. Because it’s not safe to go out.”
CHANGE OF HEART
Lam, the focus of weeks of anti-government unrest, will leave for Beijing on Monday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic the following day.
Lam, who was trapped in an indoor stadium by street protests for hours this week after an “open dialogue” with the people, will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night overland, minimising the chances of a clash at the airport, a popular target of anti-government protests.
She had sent out invitations “requesting the pleasure of your company” at a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Tuesday.
It was not immediately clear why she had the change of heart but the government said Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung would stand in for her.
Arthur, 40, wearing glasses and a mask covering the lower half of his face, said Lam’s trip was expected.
“In these three months, Carrie Lam has not really cared about the protesters. She only cares about the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) or what we might call ‘her boss’,” he said. “I think Hong Kong is somehow at this moment the frontline between Western democracy and the dictatorship in China…. Hong Kong looks more and more like a police state.”
Police fired tear gas and water cannon on Saturday night to disperse protesters who threw petrol bombs and rocks, broke government office windows and blocked a key road near the local headquarters of China’s People’s Liberation Army.
Anti-government protesters have attacked the legislature, Beijing’s main Liaison Office, occupied the airport, thrown petrol bombs at police, vandalised metro stations and set street fires in the former British colony.
Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.
The protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.
China dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.
Protests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement. Rallies in support of the anti-government protesters were held in Australia’s largest cities, with the biggest in Sydney.
Many wore face masks to hide their identity and crowds yelled “stand with Hong Kong” and “fight for freedom”, while placards depicted Chinese President Xi Jinping with a cross marked across his face.

NEW YORK: Earth is in more hot water than ever before, and so are we, an expert United Nations climate panel warned in a grim new report Wednesday.
Sea levels are rising at an ever-faster rate as ice and snow shrink, and oceans are getting more acidic and losing oxygen, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report issued as world leaders met at the United Nations.
The agency warned that if steps aren’t taken to reduce emissions and slow global warming, seas will rise 3 feet by the end of the century, with many fewer fish, less snow and ice, stronger and wetter hurricanes and other, nastier weather systems.
“The oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble, and that means we’re all in big trouble, too,” said one of the report’s lead authors, Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “The changes are accelerating.”
The dire effects will be felt on both land and sea, harming people, plants, animals, food, societies, infrastructure and the global economy. In fact, the international team of scientists projected for the first time that some island nations will probably become uninhabitable.
The oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat from carbon pollution in the air, as well as much of the carbon dioxide itself. Earth’s snow and ice, called the cryosphere, are also being eroded.
“The world’s oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe,” said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a deputy assistant administrator for research at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The report found:
Seas are now rising at one-seventh of an inch (3.66 millimeters) a year, which is 2.5 times faster than the rate from 1900 to 1990.
The world’s oceans have already lost 1% to 3% of the oxygen in their upper levels since 1970 and will lose more as warming continues.
From 2006 to 2015, the ice melting from Greenland, Antarctica and the world’s mountain glaciers has accelerated. They are now losing 720 billion tons (653 billion metric tons) of ice a year.
Arctic June snow cover has shrunk more than half since 1967, down nearly 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).
Arctic sea ice in September, the annual low point, is down almost 13% per decade since 1979. This year’s low, reported Monday, tied for the second-lowest on record.
Marine animals are likely to decrease 15%, and catches by fisheries in general are expected to decline 21% to 24%, by the end of century because of climate change.
“Climate change is already irreversible,” French climate scientist Valérie Masson-Delmotte, a report lead author, said at a news conference in Monaco, where the document was released. “Due to the heat uptake in the ocean, we can’t go back.”
But many of the worst-case projections in the report can still be avoided, depending on how the world handles the emissions of heat-trapping gases, the report’s authors said.
The IPCC increased its projected end-of-century sea level rise in the worst-case scenario by nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) from its 2013 projections because of the increased recent melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.
The new report projects that, under the business-as-usual scenario for carbon emissions, seas by the end of the century will rise between 2 feet (61 centimeters) and 43 inches (110 centimeters), with a most likely rise of 33 inches (84 centimeters). This is slightly less than the traditional 1 meter (39 inches) that scientists often use.
And sea level will rise two to three times as much over the centuries to come if warming continues, so the world is looking at a “future that certainly looks completely different than what we currently have,” said report co-author Hans-Otto Portner, a German climate scientist.
The Nobel Prize-winning IPCC requires that its reports be unanimously approved. Because of that, its reports tend to show less sea level rise and smaller harm than other scientific studies, outside experts said.
“Like many of the past reports, this one is conservative in the projections, especially in how much ice can be lost in Greenland and Antarctica,” said NASA oceanographer Josh Willis, who studies Greenland ice melt and wasn’t part of the report.
Willis said people should be prepared for a rise in sea levels to be twice these IPCC projections.
The world’s warm water coral reefs will go extinct in some places and be dramatically different in others, the report said.
“We are already seeing the demise of the warm water coral reefs,” Portner said. “That is one of the strongest warning signals that we have available.”
Outside scientists praised the work but were disturbed by it.
“It is alarming to read such a thorough cataloging of all of the serious changes in the planet that we’re driving,” said Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler. “What’s particularly disturbing as a scientist is that virtually all of these changes were predicted years or decades ago.”
The report’s authors emphasized that it doesn’t doom Earth to this gloomy future.
“We indicate we have a choice. Whether we go into a grim future depends on the decisions that are being made,” Portner said.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump welcomed Australia’s prime minister on Friday for only the second state visit of his administration, signaling the close bond between the two allies as Washington takes on Beijing and Tehran.
Trump and Scott Morrison are expected to discuss security and trade, as China’s increasing assertiveness, especially in the energy-rich South China Sea, has raised concerns within the region and the United States.
The leaders are also set to release a plan on Friday aimed at securing the supply of rare earth minerals, as concerns grow that China, the world’s largest processor and producer of the minerals, could cut off shipments of the prized commodities.
Days before the visit, a sign draped across the Australian Embassy in Washington proclaimed “100 years of mateship” between the two countries. On Friday, Trump feted Morrison’s arrival at the White House’s South Lawn with a 19-gun salute and US Marine Band performances of each nation’s national anthems.
“It’s highly symbolic of where the relationship sits at the moment,” said Patrick Buchan, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting that Morrison’s state visit was second only to French President Emmanuel Macron’s last year.
“Australia played a very smart game with Trump,” he added, noting the country had avoiding directly criticizing him, unlike some European counterparts.
Trump got off to a smooth start with Morrison in May, congratulating him on his surprise election victory in a tweet noting there were “no greater friends” than the United States and Australia.
The two also met on the sidelines of the G20 in June, cementing warm ties that Trump did not enjoy with Morrison’s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. Trump berated Turnbull in February 2017 over a bilateral refugee agreement before abruptly ending their telephone conversation.
Australia also agreed last month to join a coalition to protect oil tankers and cargo ships from threats posed by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz after a series of attacks there that Washington has blamed on Tehran.
Australia has also banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , the world’s top provider of telecoms equipment, from its 5G network, something the Trump administration has struggled to persuade other allies to do. The United States says Huawei’s ties to Beijing make the network equipment it sells to telecoms firms a security risk.
Australian intelligence concluded China was responsible for a cyberattack on Australia’s parliament and its three largest political parties, Reuters reported on Monday.
Following an arrival ceremony, bilateral meetings, and a joint news conference, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will host a luncheon for Morrison to be followed by a state dinner at the White House.
SECURITY AND TRADE
During a visit to Sydney last month by Pompeo and US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the United States and Australia pledged to strengthen opposition to Chinese activities in the Pacific.
China has unnerved the region and angered the United States by installing military equipment and other facilities on artificial islands it has made in the disputed South China Sea.
The United States and its Western allies also worry that China is using foreign aid to secure greater influence over small Pacific countries that control vast swath of resource-rich ocean.
Australia, traditionally the major power in the South Pacific, has promised up to A$3 billion ($2 billion) in grants and loans to counter what Washington describes as China’s “payday loan diplomacy.”
But Morrison has pressed Trump to end his trade war with China, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.

BEIJING: China expressed anger on Tuesday after German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas met prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, saying that no foreign country had a right to interfere in China’s internal affairs.
Wong met Maas on Monday in Berlin at an event hosted by the German newspaper BILD.
After being held for around 24 hours at the Hong Kong airport on Sunday for allegedly breaching the terms of his bail, Wong arrived in Berlin late on Monday evening, where he said he would “continue his battle for free elections”.
The timing is especially awkward as German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Beijing last week. Hong Kong has been gripped by weeks of protests, initially against a now-shelved extradition bill and now focused more on securing greater freedoms for Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China was “extremely dissatisfied and resolutely opposed” to German allowing Wong to visit and to allow him to meet the German foreign minister.
“China has already lodged stern representations with the German side,” Hua told a daily news briefing.
Hong Kong is an internal affair and no foreign government, organisation or individual has a right to interfere, she added.
“Any plots to rely on foreigners to build oneself up or acts or words to split the country are doomed to failure.”
Hua said that during her trip last week, Merkel clearly said that she opposes violence and supports “one country, two systems”.
Hong Kong returned to Beijing from British rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
“We can’t help but ask, what is the purpose of the German side in allowing Joshua Wong to come to Germany at this time and to meet with minister Maas?”
China urges Germany to abide by its promises and avoid sending wrong messages to separatist Hong Kong forces, and urges Maas to abide by the basics of international law and act for the benefit of relations and not be a “damager” of the relationship, Hua added.
Interference by foreign parliaments in Hong Kong‘s matters is deeply regrettable, the leader of the Chinese-ruled city said earlier on Tuesday, adding that an escalation of violence cannot solve social issues in the city.
Carrie Lam was speaking after another weekend of sometimes violent clashes in the former British colony, with police firing tear gas to disperse protesters in cat-and-mouse skirmishes, at times smashing windows and starting street fires.
Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding the autonomy they had been promised. China denies accusations of meddling in the city.

SRINAGAR: India on Sunday imposed curfews in several parts of the contested Kashmir region, after clashes between security forces and Shi’ite Muslims taking part in a procession, officials and eyewitnesses said.
At least 12 locals and six troops were injured on Saturday evening, officials told Reuters, as the worshippers on the traditional mourning procession of Muharram clashed with troops trying to stop it.
Troops used tear gas and pellet guns on the crowd, which insisted on carrying on with the procession, one in a series held at this time of the year, and pelted stones at security forces, an Indian official who declined to named told Reuters.
“The clashes continued till late night during which the troops fired tear gas and pellets,” he added.
A spokeswoman for India‘s interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
“Reasonable restrictions are necessary for peace and protection of life,” India‘s national security adviser had said on Saturday, accusing Islamabad of trying to stoke violence in the region.
Kashmir, a mountainous Muslim-majority region claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been the site of frequent altercations between security forces and locals protesting against New Delhi’s decision to revoke special rights for the portion of the territory that it controls on Aug. 5.
The most recent clashes occurred in Rainawari and Badgam, two Shi’ite majority areas of Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir’s main city.
The five km (3 mile) procession route that passes through the city centre has been barricaded by armed troops wearing helmets and bullet proof vests.
On Sunday, police vans fitted with loud speakers announced curfew-like restrictions in Srinagar’s city center Lal Chowk and adjacent areas, according to two Reuters witnesses.
“People are advised to stay indoors and not venture out of their home,” the police announced.
Suhail Ahmed, a Rainawari resident, said that there have been frequent clashes in the area for last three to four days as troops have been trying to block the procession.
“We hear deafening sounds of tear gas being fired for last few evenings. We mostly stay indoors but the gas comes into our homes making it difficult to sleep,” Ahmed said.
Muharram is the first month of the year according to the Muslim lunar calendar, and traditionally processions are held for the first 10 days of the month to observe the death of Prophet Muhammad’s nephew Imam Hussein, killed in battle in 680.
Shi’ite Muslims typically intensify their expression of suffering on the Ashura day, that this year falls on Tuesday.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests so the Chinese-ruled city can move forward from a “highly vulnerable and dangerous” place and find solutions.
Her televised announcement came after Reuters reports on Friday and Monday revealing that Beijing had thwarted an earlier proposal from Lam to withdraw the bill and that she had said privately that she would resign if she could, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters.
“Lingering violence is damaging the very foundations of our society, especially the rule of law,” a sombre Lam said as she sat wearing a navy blue jacket and pink shirt with her hands folded on a desk in front of her.
The withdrawal, a key demand of protesters but just one of five, came after unrest that drove the former British colony to the edge of anarchy as the government repeatedly refused to back down – igniting pitched battles across the city of seven million, the arrests of more than 1,000 protesters, and leaving a society deeply divided.
Many are furious about perceived police brutality and the number of arrests – 1,183 at the latest count – and want an independent inquiry.
“The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,” Lam said.
“I pledge that the government will seriously follow up the recommendations of the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Council) report. From this month, I and my principal officials will reach out to the community to start a direct dialogue … we must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions.”
The protests began in March but snowballed in June and have since evolved into a push for greater democracy for the city which returned to China in 1997.
The bill would have allowed extraditions to mainland China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
It was not immediately clear if killing the bill would help end the unrest. The immediate reaction appeared sceptical and the real test will be how many people take to the streets.
Some lawmakers said the move should have come earlier.
“The damage has been done. The scars and wounds are still bleeding,” said pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo. “She thinks she can use a garden hose to put out a hill fire. That’s not going to be acceptable.”
WINNING OVER MODERATES?
In the voice recording obtained by Reuters, Lam said at a meeting last week that her room to find a political solution to the crisis was “very limited”, as authorities in Beijing now viewed the situation as a matter of national security.
Beijing’s apparent endorsement of the withdrawal of the bill comes after the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rule since he took power in 2012.
Others said the move was not enough.
“This won’t appease the protesters,” said Boris Chen, 37, who works in financial services. “In any kind of time, people will find something they can get angry about.”
Pro-Beijing lawmaker Cheung Kwok-kwan said Lam’s announcement was not a compromise to appease those promoting violence, but a bid to win over moderates in the protest camp.
“It was likely speaking to the so-called peaceful, rational, non-violent people who were unsatisfied with the government’s response before,” he said.
One woman, Pearl, 69, said the protests were no longer about the bill.
“Some of those guys may change their minds, maybe, but just a minority,” she said of the protesters. “Some of them just want to create trouble and they will continue to do so.”
“Too little, too late,” said Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014 pro-democracy protests which were the precursor to the current unrest, on his Facebook page.
Leung Yiu-ting, president of the Hong Kong Education University student union, said the timing was wrong.
“Until the five demands are met, I don’t think the protests and the social movement will stop,” he said.
The protesters’ other four demands are: the retraction of the word “riot” to describe rallies, the release of all arrested demonstrators, an independent inquiry into the police perceived brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to democratically choose their own leaders.
The chief executive’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill’s withdrawal.
Hong Kong‘s benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped after the report of the bill’s imminent withdrawal, trading up about 4%. The property index also jumped.
Lam had said before that the bill was “dead”, but she did not withdraw it.
CHINA’S WARNINGS
Hong Kong returned to China under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system, hence the anger at the extradition bill and perceived creeping influence by Beijing.
China denies it is meddling in Hong Kong‘s affairs but warned again on Tuesday that it would not sit idly by if the unrest threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.
China has regularly denounced the protests and warned about the impact on Hong Kong‘s economy.
Cathay Pacific Airways has been one of the biggest corporate casualties.
China’s aviation regulator demanded it suspend staff from flying over its airspace if they were involved in, or supported, the demonstrations. The airline has laid off at least 20 including pilots and cabin crew.
The airline on Wednesday announced the resignation of chairman John Slosar, following the departure of CEO Rupert Hogg last month.
The unrest has shown no sign of easing.
Riot police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray – both anti-riot weapons – to clear demonstrators from outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station, with one man taken out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, television footage showed.
The police, who have repeatedly denied using excessive force, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HONG KONG: Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw global attention to their fight for greater democracy for the Chinese-ruled city which is facing its biggest political crisis in decades.
Planes were taking off and landing, with delays, but trains were suspended and approach roads to the airport impassable as protesters erected barricades and overturned trolleys at the airport and in the nearby new town of Tung Chung.
Some passengers were forced to walk the last bit of their journey to the airport by foot, dragging their luggage behind them.
The MTR subway station in Tung Chung was closed and demonstrators smashed CCTV cameras and lamps with metal poles and dismantled station turnstiles. Police appeared to be running in all directions and made several arrests.
Chek Lap Kok, built around a tiny outlying island in the dying days of British colonial rule, is one of the world’s busiest and most efficient airports, reached by a series of bridges which were packed with traffic.
“If we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong,” said one 20-year-old protester, asking not to be named.
Black-clad demonstrators targeted the airport three weeks ago, jamming the terminal in sometimes violent clashes with police and prompting some flights to be cancelled or delayed.
Police said protesters hurled iron poles, bricks and rocks on to the railway track near the airport station and trespassed on the track. By early evening protesters in the immediate vicinity of the airport had left, but protesters in Tung Chung remained.
“We have no idea how to leave. We’re stuck,” a masked protester said, as others looked for buses and ferries to get back home.
Sunday’s demonstration comes after police and protesters clashed overnight in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to the territory when it was handed back to China in 1997.
China denies the charge of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.
Tourist numbers have plummeted in recent weeks and international trade fairs cancelled as the territory faces its first recession in a decade.
China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.
Several hundred demonstrators also gathered outside the British consulate in central Hong Kong, waving Union Jack flags and chanting “God save the Queen”.
SUBWAY VIOLENCE
Parts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway on Saturday, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas. Police said they arrested 63 people aged between 13 and 36.
Amnesty International said the metro violence should be investigated.
“Violence directed at police on Saturday is no excuse for officers to go on the rampage elsewhere,” it said.
The latest protests came on the fifth anniversary of China’s decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong.
The unrest began in mid-June, fuelled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.
But the turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy.
The unrest poses the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.
Protesters have called for a general strike on Monday, but it was not immediately clear who would take part.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of efforts to restore calm and that talks with non-violent protesters would provide “a way out” for the Chinese-ruled city.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied peacefully in torrential rain on Sunday in the eleventh week of what have been often violent demonstrations.
“I sincerely hope that this was the beginning of society returning to peace and staying away from violence,” Lam said.
“We will immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue. This dialogue, I hope, will be based on a mutual understanding and respect and find a way out for today’s Hong Kong.”
Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China for trial.
The unrest has been fuelled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place after Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.
Three people were wounded, one critically, in a knife attack by an unknown assailant near a “Lennon Wall” of colourful pro-protest messages in the city’s Tseung Kwan O district in the New Territories overnight, police said. One man was arrested.
The protests have prompted sharp reactions from Beijing, which has accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest in the territory. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighbouring Shenzhen.
Britain’s Foreign Office said it was extremely concerned about reports that a Hong Kong staff member had been detained in mainland China, but there was no immediate suggestion that there was any link to the protests.
Staff member Simon Cheng did not return to work on Aug. 9 after visiting the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen the previous day, Hong Kong news website HK01 reported. China’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment. Hong Kong police did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc also said on Monday they had dismantled a state-backed social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on the Twitter and Facebook actions, but defended the right of Chinese people to make their voices heard.
Further demonstrations are planned in the next few days, including by MTR subway workers on Wednesday, secondary school students on Thursday and accountants on Friday.
The protests are exacting a toll on the city’s economy and tourism, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.
Singapore universities have cancelled exchange programmes to Hong Kong after Singapore warned its citizens to defer travel there, news website Today reported.
Singapore’s foreign ministry said in an advisory last week large protests in Hong Kong had become unpredictable and could turn violent with little or no notice.
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS
Sunday’s protest turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and protesters could be seen on Sunday night urging others to go home peacefully.
Aside from seeking Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
“The bill is dead,” Lam told Tuesday’s news briefing. “There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns.”
Police have been criticised for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
Lam said the police watchdog had set up a task force to investigate complaints.
She said she hoped Hong Kong had “unique advantages in attracting overseas companies”, stressing the rule of law, but warned of the risk of pressure on the economy which shrank 0.4% in April-June from the previous quarter.
“The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half. Actually, I think the data in the first half has not fully reflected the seriousness of the problem,” she said.
China has put strong pressure on big companies in Hong Kong over the protests, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s departure was announced by Chinese state television and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in protests.
China’s State Council called on Monday for greater development of the southern city of Shenzhen and integration of its culture and economy with neighbouring Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong is gearing up for further protests this week after hundreds of thousands of anti-government demonstrators braved heavy rain to rally peacefully on Sunday, marking a change to what have often been violent clashes.
Sunday’s massive turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the Chinese-ruled city’s airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and on Sunday night protesters could be seen urging others to go home peacefully.
Police said on Monday that while Sunday’s demonstration was mostly peaceful, there were breaches of the peace in the evening when some protesters defaced public buildings and aimed laser beams at officers.
It was a far cry from the violent clashes between protesters and riot police throughout the summer, with activists storming the legislature and targeting China’s main Liaison Office in the city. The weekend was also noteworthy for a lack of tear gas use by police.
The protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. They have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China, including an independent judiciary, but many in the city believe Beijing has been eroding those freedoms.
Aside from Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
One protester, speaking at a “citizen’s press conference” on Monday, was asked what path the protests would take now, peaceful or violent.
“We have started our rallies very peacefully but after two and a half months it seems that the Hong Kong government has not responded to our five demands so one thing leads to another and it may cause escalation,” the speaker, named Wang, said.
“If you ask me, I personally hope there will be a quick resolution to this from the government so we don’t have to protest any more.”
On Sunday, protesters spilling out from Victoria Park, the designated rally area on Hong Kong island, streamed onto major thoroughfares towards the city’s financial centre, chanting for Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam to step down.
Police estimated the size of the crowd in Victoria Park at 128,000 at its peak, although that excludes the masses of umbrella-carrying demonstrators who packed the streets.
CHINESE FORCES ACROSS THE BORDER
The Hong Kong government said in a statement on Sunday night it was important to restore social order as soon as possible and that it would begin talks with the public and “rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down”.
The Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, attributed the change in the character of Sunday’s protest to the presence of Chinese paramilitary forces, which have been conducting exercises in Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong.
“This was widely seen as a stern warning to the violent elements in Hong Kong,” it said, adding that a backlash from Hong Kong residents over last week’s airport occupations was another factor.
The Chinese Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper warned again in an editorial on Monday that hostile foreign influences were inciting the protest movement. Beijing has accused some countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest.
US President Donald Trump hinted on Sunday that the White House would like to see Beijing resolve the protests before the world’s two largest economies could reach a trade deal.
“I would like to see Hong Kong worked out in a very humanitarian fashion,” Trump said. “I think it would be very good for the trade deal.”
Further demonstrations are planned in coming weeks, including protests planned by Christians and even an accountants’ group.
Police have come under criticism for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations, but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
The central government has sought to deepen integration between the mainland and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and nearby Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave which returned to China in 1999. The State Council called on Monday for greater development of the so-called Greater Bay Area and to enrich the “one country, two systems” policy.
China has also put strong pressure on big companies, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s sudden departure was announced by Chinese state television on Friday and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in the protests.
Shares in Cathay rose more than 2% early on Monday before paring gains to be down 0.6%. Jeffries analysts wrote in a note on Monday that it maintained its “buy” rating on Cathay and that it expected the company to remain profitable.

KATHMANDU: Nepal must make training and experience in high altitude climbing mandatory for all climbers on Mount Everest and other high peaks, a government panel said on Wednesday, following the deadliest climbing season in four years.
Eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the 8,850 metre (29,035 feet) mountain in May – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side.
The Nepali panel – made up of government officials, climbing experts and agencies representing the climbing community – was set up after climbers and guides criticised officials after the deaths for allowing anyone who paid $11,000 to climb Everest.
Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Everest, and mountain climbing is a key source of employment and income for the cash strapped nation.
But the numbers attempting the climb in May led to crowding in the so-called death zone, where there are very low oxygen levels. That put lives at risk as oxygen cylinders ran out while up to 100 people waited in the queue.
Nepal issued 381 permits for Everest for this year’s climbing season, which tends to culimate in May, when the daylight and weather is the most forgiving.
“Climbers to Sagarmatha and other 8,000 metre mountains must undergo basic and high altitude climbing training,” the panel said in a report submitted to the government, referring to the Nepali name of Mount Everest.
The report said those hoping to climb Everest must climb at least one Nepali peak above 6,500 metres before getting a permit. Climbers must also submit a certificate of good health and physical fitness, and be accompanied by a trained Nepali guide, it said.
Ghanshyam Upadhyaya, a senior Tourism Ministry official, said the recommendations would be implemented.
“The government will now make the required changes in laws and regulations guiding mountain climbing,” he told Reuters.
Mira Acharya, a member of the panel said “climbers died due to altitude sickness, heart attack, exhaustion or weaknesses and not due to traffic jams”.
She said the compulsory provision of guides for each climber was to discourage solo attempts which put lives at risk.
A reliable weather forecasting system should be in place and rope fixing should be done in time, giving enough space for the climbers to use a window of good weather to reach the summit, the report said.

HONG KONG: Flights leaving Hong Kong were disrupted for a second day on Tuesday, plunging the former British colony deeper into turmoil as its stockmarket fell to a seven-month low, and its leader said it had been pushed into a state of “panic and chaos”.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also urged Hong Kong to exercise restraint and investigate evidence of its forces firing tear gas at protesters in ways banned under international law.
Ten weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and protesters have roiled the Asian financial hub as thousands of residents chafe at a perceived erosion of freedoms and autonomy under Chinese rule.
China this week condemned some protesters for using dangerous tools to attack police, calling the clashes “sprouts of terrorism”. They present President Xi Jinping with one of his biggest challenges since he came to power in 2012.
Hong Kong legal experts say Beijing might be paving the way to use anti-terror laws to try to quell the demonstrations.
Check-in operations were suspended at 4.30 pm on Tuesday, a day after an unprecedented airport shutdown, as thousands of black-clad protesters jammed the terminal, chanting, singing and waving banners.
“Take a minute to look at our city, our home,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said, her voice cracking, at a news conference in the government headquarters complex, which is fortified behind 6-foot (1.8-m) -high water-filled barricades.
“Can we bear to push it into the abyss and see it smashed to pieces?”
The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed suspects’ extradition to mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy.
At the airport, thousands of protesters gathered in the arrivals hall, as well as some parts of departures, using luggage trolleys to blockade the doors to customs checkpoints.
Floors and walls were covered with missives penned by activists and other artwork. The scene was peaceful as knots of protesters spoke to travellers, explaining their aims.
“Sorry for the inconvenience, we are fighting for the future of our home,” read one protest banner at the airport.
“I think paralysing the airport will be effective in forcing Carrie Lam to respond to us … it can further pressure Hong Kong’s economy,” said Dorothy Cheng, 17.
Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997.
They want Lam to resign. She says she will stay.
“My responsibility goes beyond this particular range of protest,” she said, adding that violence had pushed the territory into a state of “panic and chaos”.
As she spoke, the benchmark Hang Seng index hit a seven-month low. It shed more than 2%, dragging down markets across Asia.
Lam did not respond to questions at a press briefing to clarify if she had the power to withdraw the extradition bill and satisfy a key demand made by the protesters, or if she needed Beijing’s approval.
AIRPORT DISRUPTED
Airport authorities had earlier suspended check-in operations as the fifth day of a sit-in by protesters grew increasingly heated. Crowds continued to swell in the evening.
“Terminal operations at Hong Kong International Airport have been seriously disrupted as a result of the public assembly,” the airport authority said.
Some passengers challenged protesters over the delays as tempers began to fray, while the demonstrators, using a Chinese term of encouragement, chanted, “Hong Kong people – add oil!”
Flag carrier Cathay Pacific warned: “There is potential for further flight disruptions at short notice.”
The airline, whose British heritage makes it a symbol of Hong Kong’s colonial past, is also in a political bind.
China’s civil aviation regulator demanded that the airline suspend staff who joined or backed the protests from flights in its airspace, pushing the carrier’s shares past Monday’s 10-year low.
Other Chinese airlines have offered passengers wanting to avoid Hong Kong a free switch to nearby destinations, such as Guangzhou, Macau, Shenzhen or Zhuhai, with the disruption sending shares in Shenzhen Airport Co Ltd surging.
On Monday China said the protests had reached a critical juncture, after a weekend of street clashes in which both police and protesters appeared to toughen their resolve.
Police fired tear gas at the blackshirted crowds in districts on Hong Kong island, Kowloon and the New Territories.

HONG KONG/BEIJING: China’s aviation regulator on Friday demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend personnel who have engaged in illegal protests in the city from staffing flights into its airspace from August 10.
Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Last week, a Cathay pilot was among over 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.
On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said that Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website.
The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights.
Crew members that have not gained the authority’s approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations.
The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.
In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: “We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly.”
“The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific. There is zero tolerance for any inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour that may affect aviation safety. We deal with these incidents very seriously.”
Cathay said on Thursday it respects “everyone’s right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner,” while insisting it “recognises that Hong Kong SAR is a part of China”.
“We do not condone any activities that jeopardise the stability of Hong Kong,” it said.
On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights.
Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respects its staff’s opinions.
“We certainly wouldn’t dream of telling them what they have to think about something. They’re all adults, they’re all service professionals. We respect them greatly,” he said.
Global Times, published by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, ran news stories this week highlighting Cathay employees’ participation in the ongoing protests.
Embattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam on Friday urged an end to the violence, claiming that the protests are dragging on the city’s economy.
Hong Kong-listed Cathay is 45% owned by Swire Pacific and 22.7% held by Air China , according to Refinitiv Eikon.
The airline has been Hong Kong’s flag carrier since the colonial era. Swire Pacific’s parent, John Swire & Sons Ltd, is a UK-based conglomerate with businesses ranging from property to transportation.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Wednesday it would expel India’s ambassador and suspend bilateral trade with its arch-rival after New Delhi stripped its portion of the contested Kashmir region of special status.
Neighbours China and Pakistan, which both claim parts of the region, have voiced fierce opposition to India’s move dropping a constitutional provision that had allowed the country’s only Muslim-majority state to make its own laws.
Moin-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s newly-appointed ambassador to India, had yet to take up his post but will now not move to New Delhi, while Indian Ambassador Ajay Bisaria will be expelled, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a telephone interview with Pakistani TV channel ARY News.
“It is very obvious that our ambassador wouldn’t be in Delhi, and obviously the man who is here will also leave,” Qureshi said.
Earlier Pakistan’s National Security Committee, a panel of top government and military officials chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, said it would implement a range of measures over what it called India’s “illegal” decision to revoke Kashmir’s special status.
That includes “downgrading of diplomatic relations with India” and a further review of bilateral arrangements between the two countries, a committee statement said, without elaborating further.
Qureshi told Pakistan’s parliament on Wednesday the country was consulting with China regarding Kashmir and that he might fly to Beijing for discussions with officials there.
A spokesman for India’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ISLAMABAD/MUZAFFARABAD: Pakistan said on Tuesday it was considering further diplomatic and military pressure on India after the Hindu-majority nation stripped its portion of contested Kashmir of special status.
India on Monday dropped a constitutional provision for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which has long been a flashpoint in ties with neighbouring Pakistan, to make its own laws.
Nuclear arch-rivals India and Pakistan both claim Muslim-majority Kashmir in full but rule it in part. They have fought two wars over the territory and came close to a third this year after a car bomb set off by a Pakistan-based militant group killed dozens of Indian paramilitary police.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday India’s removal of special status for Kashmir, which included prohibiting outsiders from owning property, was an attempt to alter the demographics of the region and was illegal under international law.
“We will fight it at every forum. We’re thinking how we can take it to International Court (of Justice)… to the United Nations Security Council,” Khan said in an address to Pakistan’s parliament.
Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, accusing India of violating Security Council resolutions on Kashmir.
Qureshi is returning early from the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as a result of the crisis, the foreign ministry said.
India maintains its actions in Kashmir are legal both under domestic and international law.
Earlier on Tuesday, Pakistan’s army chief said the country’s military will “go to any extent” to support people in the region.
“Pakistan Army firmly stands by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end,” said General Qamar Javed Bajwa after meeting with top commanders in Rawalpindi.
“We are prepared and shall go to any extent to fulfil our obligations in this regard,” he added, without elaborating further.
BUSINESS SHUTDOWN
In Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir around 45km (28 miles) from the contested border between the neighbours, protests continued for a second day with hundreds of people including children shouting anti-India slogans.
In the Neelum Valley, which sits on the border and has seen heavy shelling between the two countries in recent weeks, there was a shutdown of shops and businesses in protest at India’s decision.
Many people in Kashmir have relatives on both sides of the border, but people on the Pakistani side say they have been unable to contact those in India for several days after New Delhi restricted internet and phone access.
Tanveer-ul-Islam migrated from India to Muzaffarabad in 1990. His family, including his elderly mother and siblings, live in the Badgam district of Indian Kashmir, but he said he has been unable to contact them for two days.
“My day does not begin until I speak to my mother, but I have not been able to talk to her (since) Aug 4. You can’t even imagine my pain,” he said. “We do not know about the well being of anyone across the divide”.
His wife Haleema Akhtar, whose family is in Magam in Indian-administered Kashmir, said she was also unable to contact them.
“I called my daughter and son-in-law in the US to try to contact them, but they too expressed helplessness in the face of the clampdown on communication,” she said.

HONG KONG: Police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong on Sunday after violent clashes a day earlier, and Beijing said it would not let the situation persist.
The Chinese-controlled city has been rocked by months of protests against a proposed bill to allow people to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China and they have now grown into calls for greater democracy.
A general strike aimed at bringing the city, an Asian financial hub, to a halt is planned for Monday.
After the peaceful demonstrations finished, hundreds of masked protesters blocked roads in the town of Tseung Kwan O in the New Territories, set up barricades and hurled hard objects, including bricks at a police station.
Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters after a separate rally in the island’s Western district where thousands of people gathered to urge authorities to listen to public demands.
Protesters had began a march towards China’s Liaison Office which has been a flashpoint at previous protests.
Police said the protesters were “participating in an unathorised assembly”, similar to Saturday when they fired multiple tear gas rounds in confrontations with black-clad activists in the Kowloon area.
Police said they had arrested more than 20 people for offences overnight including unlawful assembly and assault. The protests have become the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule 22 years ago after being governed by Britain since 1842. China’s official news agency Xinhua said on Sunday: “Central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue. We firmly believe that Hong Kong will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges ahead.”
During the day protesters had marched brandishing coloured leaflets, called for a mass strike across Hong Kong on Monday and shouted “Restore Hong Kong” and “Revolution of our time.”
“We’re trying to tell the government to (withdraw) the extradition bill and to police to stop the investigations and the violence,” said Gabriel Lee, a 21-year-old technology student.
Lee said what made him most angry was that the government was not responding to any of the protesters’ demands or examining the police violence.
What started as an angry response to the now suspended extradition bill, has expanded to demands for greater democracy and the resignation of leader Carrie Lam.
“Even if Carrie Lam resigns, its still not resolved. It’s all about the Communist Party, the Chinese government,” said Angie, a 24-year-old working for a non-government organisation.
Protesters on Saturday set fires in the streets, outside a police station and in rubbish bins, and blocked the entrance to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon peninsula.
Shops in the tourist and commercial area Nathan Road, normally packed on a Saturday, were shuttered including 7-11 convenience stores, jewellery chain Chow Tai Fook and watch brands Rolex and Tudor.
Thousands of civil servants joined in the anti-government protests on Friday for the first time since they started in June, defying a warning from authorities to remain politically neutral.
PROTEST TACTICS
The protests have adapted rapidly since the start of June with the movement spreading from the Admiralty area, where the legislative council is located, across to the whole city for the first time.
Previous protests have also targeted mainland visitors to try and make them understand the situation in what is officially termed a Special Administrative Region of China.
Young people have mostly been at the forefront of the protests, infuriated with broader problems including sky-high living costs and what they see as an unfair housing policy skewed towards the rich.
However, the demonstrations have seen people of all ages, including families and the elderly take part.
The protests mark the biggest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took office in 2012.
Hong Kong has been allowed to retain extensive freedoms, such as an independent judiciary but many residents see the extradition bill as the latest step in a relentless march toward mainland control.
Months of demonstrations are taking a growing toll on the city’s economy, as local shoppers and tourists avoid parts of one of the world’s most famous shopping destinations.
Matthew Wang, a 22-year-old marketing executive for a multinational corporation, said that the government was “encouraging people to become more radical to affect decision making because they are not addressing any of the demands.”

184,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/us-believes-osama-bin-ladens-son-hamza-is-dead-official/,"NEW YORK: The United States believes that Hamza bin Laden, a son of slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and himself a notable figure in the militant group, is dead, a US official said on Wednesday.
The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, provided no further details, including when Hamza died or where.
President Donald Trump earlier on Wednesday declined to comment after NBC News first reported the US assessment. Asked if he had intelligence that bin Laden’s son had been killed, Trump told reporters: “I don’t want to comment on it.”
Separately, the White House declined comment on whether any announcement was imminent.
Hamza, believed to be about 30 years old, was at his father’s side in Afghanistan before the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and spent time with him in Pakistan after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan pushed much of al Qaeda’s senior leadership there, according to the Brookings Institution.
Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces who raided his compound in Pakistan in 2011. Hamza was thought to be under house arrest in Iran at the time, and documents recovered from the compound indicated that aides had been trying to reunite him with his father.
The New York Times reported that the United States had a role in the operation that led to Hamza’s death, which it said took place in the past two years. Reuters could not immediately verify those details.
Still, the US government’s conclusion appears to be a recent one. In February, the State Department said it was offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading “to the identification or location in any country” of Hamza, calling him a key al Qaeda leader.
Introduced by al Qaeda’s chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio message in 2015, Hamza provided a younger voice for the group whose ageing leaders have struggled to inspire militants around the world galvanized by Islamic State, according to analysts.
Hamza has called for acts of terrorism in Western capitals and threatened to take revenge against the United States for his father’s killing, the US State Department said in 2017 when it designated him as a global terrorist.
He also threatened to target Americans abroad and urged tribal groups in Saudi Arabia to unite with Yemen’s al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to fight against Saudi Arabia, it said.
In March, Saudi Arabia announced it had stripped Hamza bin Laden of his citizenship, saying the decision was made by a royal order in November 2018.

KUALA LUMPUR: An undocumented domestic worker has the right to pursue her claim for unpaid wages in Malaysia, a court has ruled, setting a legal precedent migrant rights groups said would help protect human trafficking survivors.
In a landmark ruling this week, a high court in Malaysia said an Indonesian domestic worker who was not paid for nearly five years can pursue her case after it was dismissed earlier by labour authorities because she did not have a work permit.
“This is a precedent for all undocumented workers,” Glorene Das, executive director at the Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Tuesday.
“With this precedent, there is hope for undocumented workers to seek redress in court. They are workers who have been exploited in trafficked and forced labour situations,” she said by phone.
Malaysia relies heavily on foreign workers in areas such as manufacturing, domestic work and on plantations, hosting millions of migrant labourers from countries such as Indonesia, Nepal and Bangladesh.
But many of them are victims of human trafficking who were duped by brokers with promises of lucrative pay, often arriving without a valid work permit, and then suffer abuses later.
The Indonesian woman, who is in her 20s and whose name was withheld by Tenaganita for privacy reasons, fled to the group’s shelter in 2017. Tenaganita helped her file the legal case over unpaid wages.
She sought about 30,000 Malaysian ringgit ($7,300) in unpaid wages at the government’s labour department and then a labour court, but both rejected her case.
She lodged an appeal with a high court last year, which ruled on Monday that it was “premature” for the claim to be thrown out based on the work permit status, according to Tenaganita and the Malaysiakini news website.
The court also ordered the case to be fully heard.
“All I want is my wages that I have worked for, so that I can go home to my family,” the Indonesian woman said in a statement provided by Tenaganita.
The high court and the labour department could not be reached on Tuesday due to a public holiday.
Indonesia and Cambodia, key sources of migrant workers to Malaysia, have in the past temporarily banned their citizens from going to work in Malaysia as maids after cases of abuse.
Malaysia has said this year that it was ready to “declare war” on human trafficking and forced labour, with a review of labour laws was underway.
The U.S. State Department’s 2019 Trafficking in Persons report put Malaysia in its Tier 2 Watch List – the second-lowest ranking – for not meeting the minimum standards in efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

Chinese health expert confirms virus can pass person-to-person
Fourth person dies from pneumonia in city of Wuhan
Authorities have so far confirmed at least 217 cases

SHANGHAI: The Chinese official investigating a pneumonia outbreak stemming from a new coronavirus said the disease can spread from person to person but can be halted with increased vigilance, as authorities on Tuesday confirmed a fourth death.
Zhong Nanshan said there was no danger of a repeat of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic that killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-2003 outbreak, which started in China, as long as precautions were taken.
“It took only two weeks to identify the novel coronavirus,” state news agency Xinhua quoted Zhong as saying late on Monday.
The outbreak was still in its early stages and China had good surveillance and quarantine systems to help control it, he added.

The outbreak has spread from the central city of Wuhan to cities including Beijing and Shanghai, with more than 200 cases reported so far. Four cases have been reported outside China – in South Korea, Thailand and Japan.
Australia on Tuesday said it would screen passengers on flights from Wuhan amid rising concerns that the virus will spread globally as Chinese travellers take flights abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday starting this week.
Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travellers from Wuhan.
Chinese authorities confirmed a total of 217 cases of the virus in China as of 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Monday, state television reported, 198 of which were in Wuhan.
A fourth person died on Jan. 19, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said. The 89-year-old man, who had underlying health diseases including coronary heart disease, developed symptoms on Jan. 13 and was admitted to hospital five days later, it added.
Zhong, who is renowned in China for his work fighting SARS in 2003, confirmed that the virus can pass from person-to-person.
Fifteen medical workers in Wuhan had been diagnosed with pneumonia, with one other suspected case, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said. Of the infected staff, one was in critical condition.
In Shanghai, officials on Tuesday confirmed a second case involving a 35-year-man who had visited Wuhan in early January, and said they were monitoring four other suspected cases.
The virus causes a type of pneumonia and belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as SARS. Symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for screening efforts.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday an animal source appeared most likely to be the primary origin of the outbreak and that some “limited human-to-human transmission” occurred between close contacts.
The Geneva-based U.N. agency convened an emergency committee for Wednesday to assess whether the outbreak constitutes an international health emergency and what measures should be taken to manage it.
So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions, but a panel of independent experts could do so or make other recommendations to limit spread.

187,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cases-of-new-viral-pneumonia-in-china-surpass-200/,"BEIJING: China reported a sharp rise in the number of people infected with a new coronavirus on Monday, including the first cases in the capital. The outbreak coincides with the country’s busiest travel period, as millions board trains and planes for the Lunar New Year holidays.
Health authorities in the central city of Wuhan, where the viral pneumonia appears to have originated, said an additional 136 cases have been confirmed in the city, which now has a total of 198 infected patients. As of the weekend, a third patient had died, bringing the death toll to three.
Two individuals in Beijing and one in the southern city of Shenzhen have also been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, health commissions in the respective cities said Monday. The three people had visited Wuhan.
The outbreak has put other countries on alert as millions of Chinese travel for Lunar New Year. Authorities in Thailand and in Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China.
South Korea reported its first case Monday, when a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the new coronavirus one day after arriving at Seoul’s Incheon airport. The woman has been isolated at a state-run hospital in Incheon city, just west of Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.
At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three US airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.
Videos posted online show people in protective suits checking one-by-one the temperatures of plane passengers arriving in Macao from Wuhan. A man surnamed Yang who works for the Macao Health Bureau confirmed over the phone that such checks are indeed taking place in the southern Chinese region.
Many of the initial cases of the coronavirus had connections to a seafood market in Wuhan, which was closed as an investigation was underway.
As hundreds of people who came into close contact with diagnosed patients were not infected themselves, the municipal health commission maintains that the virus is not easily transmitted between humans, though it has not ruled out limited human-to-human transmission.
China’s National Health Commission said experts have judged the current outbreak to be “preventable and controllable.”
“However, the source of the new type of coronavirus has not been found, we do not fully understand how the virus is transmitted, and changes in the virus still need to be closely monitored,” the commission said in a statement Sunday.
Coronaviruses cause diseases ranging from the common cold to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS first infected people in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800. The Chinese government initially tried to conceal the severity of the SARS epidemic, but its cover-up was exposed by a high-ranking physician.
“In the early days of SARS, reports were delayed and covered up,” said an editorial in the nationalistic Global Times. “That kind of thing must not happen again in China.”
“We have made great strides in medicine, social affairs management and public opinion since 2003,” the editorial said.
China is putting forth its “utmost efforts to tackle the situation,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday.
The government has notified and maintained close communication with the World Health Organization and other relevant countries and regions, Geng said, adding that Wuhan has adopted measures to control the flow of people leaving the city.
The virus causing the current outbreak is different from those previously identified, Chinese scientists said earlier this month. Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus include fever, cough, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath.
On the Weibo social media platform, which is widely used in China, people posted prevention advice such as wearing masks and washing hands. State broadcaster CCTV recommended staying warm, increasing physical activity, eating lightly and avoiding crowded places. Some people said they had canceled their travel plans and were staying home for Lunar New Year.

SHANGHAI: An outbreak of coronavirus in China is spreading to more cities, Chinese authorities reported on Monday, with 139 new cases found over the weekend, including a third death.
The Daxing health commission in the capital Beijing said it had confirmed two cases of coronavirus, while the southern Guangdong province’s health commission confirmed one case in Shenzhen.
The new cases, the first inside China outside the central city of Wuhan where the virus was first reported, come as the country gears up for the Lunar New Year holidays later this week, when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel domestically and abroad.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement that 136 new cases of coronavirus had been discovered in the city on Saturday and Sunday.
As of late Sunday, 198 cases in total had been reported in Wuhan, including three deaths. Some 170 people were still being treated in the hospital, while 25 had been cured, it said. The statement gave no further details of the latest death toll.
Outside China, two cases have been reported in Thailand and one in Japan, all involving people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city.
Beijing said on Sunday it will increase efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, while health authorities around the world are working to prevent its spread.
The new virus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.
Some experts say the new virus may not be as deadly as SARS, but there is still little known about it including its origin and how easily it can be transmitted between humans.

TB patients continue to experience barriers in access, diagnosis and completion of treatment.
Researchers said barriers to access health centres were long distance, poor road condition and costs associated with travelling.
Challenges in mitigating mortality associated with tuberculosis were barriers like access to health services, diagnosis and adherence to treatment, researchers said.
A research was conducted by Dr Sujan Babu Marahatta working at Manmohan Memorial Institute of Health Sciences and his team in six districts of Tarai, hilly and mountain regions — Tanahun, Kaski, Parsa, Nawalparasi, Mustang and Kathmandu.
The researchers found that scarcity of staff at health facilities was a major problem in Nepal. This was echoed by respondents in all the six districts.
The study was conducted among health service providers, traditional healers, tuberculosis patients and community members.
The participants said irregularity of staffers, office hours and absence of staffers at health facilities were major impediments for patients.
The research titled ‘Barriers in Access, Diagnosis and Treatment Completion for Tuberculosis Patients in Central and Western Nepal: A Qualitative Study Among Patients, Community Members and Health Care Workers’ was published in Plus One Journal.
The researchers have pointed out that health centres often lacked enough lab staffers and reagents to detect new cases of TB. Early diagnosis of TB was hindered by lack of trained health staffers for using equipment, lack of equipment and irregular presence of health workers, according to researchers. Lack of staff, who could detect, treat and dispense medicine for tuberculosis was a major problem resulting in missed opportunity for diagnosis, delayed initiation of the medicine, inadequate counselling and poor adherence to medication, according to the report.
“One of the most pronounced factors from all the respondents in all districts was the distance to the health centre. Coupled with the geographical barriers to access, for instance, uphill route, forested path and rivers/springs along the path towards health centres discouraged patients from accessing health services,” said Dr Marahatta. “The main objective of this study was to explore factors affecting access to health services, diagnosis and treatment completion for TB patients in central and western Nepal,” added Dr Marahatta.
The research team also suggested enhancing efficiency of health facilities by adequately mobilising required human resources and by ensuring provision of equipment for diagnosis of TB and medications for TB treatment.
“Health centres can be improved by ensuring skilled human resources and equipment for diagnosis, increasing awareness and collaborating with traditional healers.
Health services utilisation can be enhanced by compensating direct and indirect costs, including modification in the current DOTS strategy by providing medicine for longer term under the supervision of family member or a community member utilising the elements of community engagement,” researchers suggested.
TB is caused by bacteria — mycobacterium tuberculosis that most often affects the lungs.
TB spreads from person to person through the air. When patients cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air.
Around 45,000 new TB cases are added each year. As per National Tuberculosis Centre, an estimated 32,000 cases have been registered under National Tuberculosis Programme, each year.

BEIJING: Chinese health authorities said on Saturday they had discovered four more cases of pneumonia following an outbreak of what is believed to be a new coronavirus strain in the central city of Wuhan, raising concerns that the disease could spread further.
The four individuals were diagnosed with pneumonia on Thursday and are in stable condition, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement published shortly after midnight, a day after it confirmed the death of a second patient.
Nearly 50 people are known to have been infected and so far involve only individuals who have travelled to or live in Wuhan, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that a wider outbreak is possible. Many of China’s 1.4 billion people will be travelling abroad during the Lunar New Year holidays next week, raising concerns about the disease spreading to other countries.
A report published by the London Imperial College’s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis asserted there are likely “substantially more cases” of the new coronavirus than the 45 currently announced by Wuhan authorities.
A summary of the report on the centre’s website says its baseline scenario estimates that there would be 1,723 cases showing the onset of related symptoms by Jan 12. The full report was not available, however.
The Wuhan commission referred queries on the report to China’s National Health Commissi5on and the Hubei provincial government. The National Health Commission and the Hubei government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Thailand reported two cases of the coronavirus from Chinese travellers from Wuhan this week, while Japan confirmed one case involving a Japanese national who travelled to Wuhan. Memories remain fresh in Asia of a 2002/03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS.
Health officials say the new virus discovered in Wuhan does not appear to be as lethal as SARS but admit they still know little about it, including its origins or how easily it can be transmitted from person to person.
A seafood market in Wuhan is believed to be the epicentre, but authorities say some patients they have identified deny having any exposure to this market.
U.S. authorities have said they would start screening at three airports to detect travellers arriving via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan who may have symptoms of the new virus.
In Asia, authorities in Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand have stepped up monitoring of passengers from Wuhan at airports. Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines say they have strengthened screening at all points of entry in response to the outbreak, as well.
Japan screens all incoming travellers for high temperatures and started displaying notices at airports around the country asking passengers to come forward if they have travelled to Wuhan and have become sick.
Australia, which saw about 1.4 million short-term arrivals from China last year, is not planning any special screenings for now.
The WHO has said it advises against any travel or trade restrictions on China.

A division of the American Library Association has added the Poe house to its national registry of Literary Landmarks. The museum will host a dedication ceremony on Sunday, which coincides with the celebration of the 211th anniversary of Poe’s birth.
The house is the first literary site in Maryland to be included in the registry, the organization said. Previous dedications have included the homes of Tennessee Williams, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and William Faulkner.
The master of Gothic horror lived at the Baltimore house as an adult from 1833 to 1835. It became a museum in 1949 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971.
The museum says “MS. Found in a Bottle,” “Berenice” and “Morella” are among the stories Poe wrote at the landmark.

More areas off limits to development in next 5-year plan
Arrests for environment crimes on Yangtze in 2019 up 43% on year
China‘s overall water quality improved last year

BEIJING/SHANGHAI: China will impose more curbs on agriculture and widen restrictions on industrial development in the next five years in a bid to protect scarce, already contaminated water supplies from further pollution, a government official said on Friday.
The government is planning to restrict farming that encroaches on major rivers, restore wetlands and ecosystems and tackle excess water consumption in its 2021-2025 five-year plan, said Zhang Bo, head of the water department at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, speaking at a news briefing.
With per capita water resources only a quarter of the global average, China has made the restoration of contaminated supplies a priority. Zhang said the government would now take ecological value into consideration as well as economic value.

Beijing has been drawing what it calls “ecological protection red lines” that make areas off-limits to agriculture and industry. But with water demand still on the rise, it must strike a balance between bolstering economic growth, maximising agricultural output and protecting its rivers.
“Farmland that encroaches on the river is essentially not allowed to be there anyway,” Zhang told Reuters on the sidelines of the briefing in Beijing. “The drawing of ‘ecological protection red lines’ will take food security into consideration and strike that balance.”
China is in the middle of a campaign to restore the environment of the Yangtze river, which provides water to around 40% of the country’s population. The river has been damaged by decades of land reclamation, water diversion and the dumping of toxic waste.
Local governments have already been demolishing dams, relocating chemical plants, restoring wetlands and banning farming and fishing in ecologically sensitive areas, but some regions still fail to meet state water standards.
Earlier this week, China‘s top prosecution office said 7,084 people were arrested for environmental crimes on the Yangtze in 2019, up 43% on the year, with offences including illegal fishing and sand mining as well as the dumping of waste.
The environment ministry said water quality was improving overall, with 75% of surface water sampled at 1,940 sites across the country up to standard in 2019, up 3.9 percentage points compared to 2018.
China divides its water into six grades, with the first three considered safe for human use. The ministry said 3.4% remained “below grade V” – meaning it was unfit even for industrial or agricultural use – down 3.3 percentage points on the year.

193,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/3-african-countries-trying-out-1st-malaria-vaccine-in-babies/,"TOMALI, MALAWI: A pinch in the leg, a squeal and a trickle of tears. One baby after another in Malawi is getting the first and only vaccine against malaria, one of history’s deadliest and most stubborn of diseases.
The southern African nation is rolling out the shots in an unusual pilot program along with Kenya and Ghana. Unlike established vaccines that offer near-complete protection, this new one is only about 40% effective. But experts say it’s worth a try as progress against malaria stalls: Resistance to treatment is growing and the global drop in cases has leveled off.

With the vaccine, the hope is to help small children through the most dangerous period of their lives. Spread by mosquito bites, malaria kills more than 400,000 people every year, two-thirds of them under 5 and most in Africa.
Seven-month-old Charity Nangware received a shot on a rainy December day at a health clinic in the town of Migowi. She watched curiously as the needle slid into her thigh, then twisted up her face with a howl.
“I’m very excited about this,” said her mother, Esther Gonjani, who herself gets malaria’s aches, chills and fever at least once a year and loses a week of field work when one of her children is ill. “They explained it wasn’t perfect, but I feel secure it will relieve the pain.”
There is little escaping malaria — “malungo” in the local Chichewa language — especially during the five-month rainy season. Stagnant puddles, where mosquitoes breed, surround the homes of brick and thatch and line the dirt roads through tea plantations or fields of maize and sugar cane.
In the village of Tomali, the nearest health clinic is a two-hour bike ride away. The longer it takes to get care, the more dangerous malaria can be. Teams from the clinic offer basic medical care during visits once or twice a month, bringing the malaria shot and other vaccines in portable coolers.
Treating malaria takes up a good portion of their time during the rainy season, according to Daisy Chikonde, a local health worker.
“If this vaccine works, it will reduce the burden,” she said.
Resident Doriga Ephrem proudly said her 5-month-old daughter, Grace, didn’t cry when she got the malaria shot.
When she heard about the vaccine, Ephrem said her first thought was “protection is here.” Health workers explained, however, that the vaccine is not meant to replace antimalarial drugs or the insecticide-treated bed net she unfolds every night as the sun sets and mosquitoes rise from the shadows.
“We even take our evening meals inside the net to avoid mosquitoes,” she said.
It took three decades of research to develop the new vaccine, which works against the most common and deadly of the five parasite species that cause malaria. The parasite’s complex life cycle is a huge challenge. It changes forms in different stages of infection and is far harder to target than germs.
“We don’t have any vaccines against parasites in routine use. This is uncharted territory,” said Ashley Birkett, who directs PATH’s Malaria Vaccine Initiative, a nonprofit that helped drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline develop the shot, brand-named Mosquirix.
The bite of an infected mosquito sends immature parasites called sporozoites into the bloodstream. If they reach the liver, they’ll mature and multiply before spewing back into the blood to cause malaria’s debilitating symptoms. At that point, treatment requires medicines that kill the parasites.
Mosquirix uses a piece of the parasite — a protein found only on sporozoites’ surface — in hopes of blocking the liver stage of infection. When a vaccinated child is bitten, the immune system should recognize the parasite and start making antibodies against it.
Scientists also are searching for next-generation alternatives. In the pipeline is an experimental vaccine made of whole malaria parasites dissected from mosquitoes’ salivary glands but weakened so they won’t make people sick. Sanaria Inc. has been testing its vaccine in adults, and is planning a large, late-stage study in Equatorial Guinea’s Bioko Island.
And the U.S. National Institutes of Health soon will start initial tests of whether injecting people periodically with lab-made antibodies, rather than depending on the immune system to make them, could offer temporary protection during malaria season. Think of them as “potentially short-term vaccines,” NIH’s Dr. Robert Seder told a recent meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
For now, only babies in parts of Malawi, Kenya and Ghana are eligible for the Mosquirix vaccine. After the vaccine was approved in 2015, the World Health Organization said it first wanted a pilot roll-out to see how well it worked in a few countries — in real-world conditions — before recommending that the vaccine be given more widely across Africa.
“Everyone is looking forward to getting it,” said Temwa Mzengeza, who oversees Malawi’s vaccine programs. Those eager for the shots include her husband, whom she had to stop from trying to get them, she said.
Mzengeza used to come down with malaria several times a year until she started following her own advice to sleep under a net every night. Unlike many other kinds of infections, people can get malaria repeatedly, building up only a partial immunity.
In the pilot program that began last year, 360,000 children in the three countries are meant to be vaccinated annually. The first dose is given at about age 5 months and the final, fourth booster near the child’s second birthday.
Experts say it is too early to know how well the vaccine is working. They’re watching for malaria deaths, severe infections and cases of meningitis, something reported during studies but not definitively linked to the vaccine.
“To do something completely new for malaria is exciting,” said researcher Don Mathanga, who is leading the evaluation in Malawi.
The rainy season has brought new challenges, making some rural roads impassable and complicating efforts to track down children due for a shot. So far in Malawi, the first dose reached about half of the children targeted, about 35,000. That dropped to 26,000 for the second dose and 20,000 for the third.
That’s not surprising for a new vaccine, Mzengeza said. “It will pick up with time.”
At the health clinic in Migowi in Malawi’s southern highlands, workers see signs of hope. Henry Kadzuwa explains the vaccine to mothers waiting at the clinic. He said there was a drop in malaria cases to 40 in the first five months of the program, compared to 78 in the same period in 2018.
Even though he wishes his 3-year-old daughter, Angel, could receive the vaccine, “it’s protecting my community. It also makes my work easier,” Kadzuwa said. The Migowi area has one of the country’s highest rates of malaria, and a worn paper register in the clinic’s laboratory lists scores of cases.
At the clinic, Agnes Ngubale said she had malaria several years ago and wants to protect her 6-month-old daughter, Lydia, from the disease.
“I want her to be healthy and free,” she said. “I want her to be a doctor.”
And she has memorized the time for Lydia’s second dose: “Next month, same date.”

194,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australia-firefighters-save-worlds-only-rare-dinosaur-trees/,"CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA: Specialist firefighters have saved the world’s last remaining wild stand of a prehistoric tree from wildfires that razed forests west of Sydney, officials said Thursday.
Firefighters winched from helicopters to reach the cluster of fewer than 200 Wollemi Pines in a remote gorge in the Blue Mountains a week before a massive wildlife bore down, National Parks and Wildlife Service Director David Crust said.

The firefighters set up an irrigation system to keep the so-called dinosaur trees moist and pumped water daily from the gorge as the blaze that had burned out of control for more than two month edged closer.
Firefighting planes strategically bombed the fire front with fire retardant to slow its progress.
“That helped just to slow the intensity of the fire as it approached the site,” Crust told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
“The Wollemi Pine is a particularly important species and the fact that this is the only place in the world where they exist and they exist in such small numbers is really significant,” he added.
New South Wales state Environment Minister Matt Kean said the operation had saved the stand, although some plants had been singed.
“These pines outlived the dinosaurs, so when we saw the fire approaching we realized we had to do everything we could to save them,” Kean said.
The Wollemi Pine had only been seen in its fossilized form and was thought long extinct before the stand was found in 1994.
The fire that threatened it was brought under control this week after razing more than 510,000 hectares (1.26 million acres). The fire also destroyed 90% of the 5,000-hectare (12,400-acre) Wollemi National Park, where the rare trees grow, Crust said.
The exact location of the stand remains a closely guarded secret to help authorities protect the trees.
The Wollemi’s survival is one of the few positive stories to emerge from the unprecedented wildlife crisis in southeast Australia.
The fires have claimed at least 28 lives since September, destroyed more than 2,600 homes and razed more than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 million acres), mostly in New South Wales state. The area burned is larger than the U.S. state of Indiana.
But the fire danger has been diminished by rain this week in several areas. The first green buds of regrowth have already emerged in some blacked forests following rain.

195,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/fever-chart-earth-had-its-hottest-decade-on-record-in-2010s/,"WASHINGTON: The decade that just ended was by far the hottest ever measured on Earth, capped off by the second-warmest year on record, two US agencies reported Wednesday. And scientists said they see no end to the way man-made climate change keeps shattering records.
“If you think you’ve heard this story before, you haven’t seen anything yet,” Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said at the close of a decade plagued by raging wildfires, melting ice and extreme weather that researchers have repeatedly tied to human activity.
Schmidt said Earth as a whole is probably the hottest it has been during the Holocene — the past 11,500 years or so — meaning this could be the warmest period since the dawn of civilisation. But scientists’ estimates of ancient global temperatures, based on tree rings, ice cores and other telltale signs, are not precise enough to say that with certainty.
The 2010s averaged 58.4 degrees Fahrenheit (14.7 degrees Celsius) worldwide, or 1.4 degrees (0.8 C) higher than the 20th century average and more than one-third of a degree (one-fifth of a degree C) warmer than the previous decade, which had been the hottest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The decade had eight of the 10 hottest years on record. The only other years in the top 10 were 2005 and 1998.
NASA and NOAA also calculated that 2019 was the second-hottest year in the 140 years of record-keeping. Five other global teams of monitoring scientists agreed, based on temperature readings taken on Earth’s surface, while various satellite-based measurements said it was anywhere from the hottest year on record to the third-hottest.
Several scientists said the coming years will be even hotter, knocking these years out of the record books.
“This is going to be part of what we see every year until we stabilise greenhouse gases” from the burning of coal, oil and gas, Schmidt said.
“It’s sobering to think that we might be breaking global temperature records in quick succession,” said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb. “2020 is off to a horrifying climate start, and I fear what the rest of the year will bring to our doorsteps.”
NASA’s Schmidt said that overall, Earth is now about 1.2 degrees C (nearly 2.2 F) hotter since the beginning of the industrial age, a number that is important because in 2015 global leaders adopted a goal of preventing 1.5 C (2.7 F) of warming since the rise of big industry in the mid- to late 1800s. He said that shows the global goal can’t be achieved. (NOAA and the World Meteorological Organization put the warming since the dawn of industry slightly lower.)
“We have strong human-induced global warming,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. “What we observe here is exactly what our physical understanding tells us to expect and there is no other explanation.”
Other explanations that rely on natural causes — extra heat from the sun, more reflection of sunlight because of volcanic particles in atmosphere, and just random climate variations — “are all much too small to explain the long-term trend,” Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said.
Scientists said the the decade-long data is more telling than the year-to-year measurements, where natural variations such as El Nino, the periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean, come into play.
“Human-caused climate change is responsible for the long-term warming — it’s responsible for why the 2010s were warmer than 2000s, which were warmer than the 1990s, etc.,” Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler said in an email. “But humans are not responsible for why 2016 was warmer than 2015 or why 2019 was warmer than 2018.”
NOAA said the average global temperature in 2019 was 58.7 degrees (14.85 C), or just a few hundredths of a degree behind 2016, when the world got extra heat from El Nino. That’s 1.71 degrees (0.95 C) higher than the 20th century average and 2.08 degrees (1.16 C) warmer than the late 19th century.
Parts of Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America had record-high temperatures in 2019, as did Alaska, New Zealand and New Mexico, NOAA said. Alaska was 6.2 degrees warmer than average, at 32.2 F. It was the first time in recorded history that Alaska’s average annual temperature was above freezing.
The United States, which had only its 34th-warmest year, was nevertheless hit by 14 weather disasters that caused $1 billion or more in damage last year, according to NOAA.
Globally the past five years stand out as the hottest five on record, nearly 1.7 degrees (0.9 C) warmer than the 20th century average. The last year Earth was cooler than the 20th century average was 1976, before Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, French President Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump Jr. were born.
If you want to know what this means for people and the world, just look at wildfire-stricken Australia, Schmidt and others said.
Global warming is already being seen in heat waves, ice sheet melt, more wildfires, stronger storms, flood-inducing downpours and accelerating sea level rise, said Hans-Otto Portner, who heads the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change team that looks at the impact of climate change.
Sea ice both in the Arctic and Antarctic reached their second-lowest levels in 40 years of monitoring, NOAA reported.
Dr. Renee Salas, a Boston emergency room physician and Harvard professor who studies climate change’s effects on health, said “these temperatures are not just statistics but have names and stories,” mentioning a construction worker and an elderly man with no air conditioning who were her patients this summer.
“The planet has a fever,” Salas said, “and that’s its symptom.”

196,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/us-warns-citizens-in-china-against-pneumonia-outbreak/,"BEIJING: The US State Department warned Americans in China about an outbreak of pneumonia in the central city of Wuhan believed to be caused by a new strain of coronavirus, and which has killed one person.
The outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January, when many of China’s 1.4 billion people will be travelling to their home towns or abroad. The World Health Organization and Chinese authorities are taking steps to ensure the disease does not spread further.
WHO has said there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in China within families.
And authorities in Wuhan confirmed on Wednesday that a married couple were among 41 people diagnosed with pneumonia believed to be caused by the new virus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission did not say in the statement whether the couple represented an instance of human-to-human transmission. But it said the husband, who worked at a seafood market suspected of being at the epicentre of the outbreak, was the first to fall ill, and that his wife did not have any exposure to the market.
Some of the other people diagnosed also denied visiting the market, the commission said. The authorities in Wuhan also confirmed that a Chinese woman quarantined in Thailand, the first case of the mystery strain of coronavirus to be detected outside of China, had come from Wuhan.
The State Department’s notice referred to an alert by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging citizens in China travelling to Wuhan to avoid contact with animals, animal markets or animal products, among other precautions.
It also asked citizens those who had visited Wuhan and feel sick to seek medical care.

LONDON: Bushfires ravaging Australia have provided a foretaste of the kinds of conditions that could become normal unless the world moves rapidly to curb emissions of the greenhouse gases driving global warming, scientists have warned.
Although Australia‘s government and parts of its media have attempted to downplay the role of man-made climate change in making the country more vulnerable to wildfires, a review of 57 scientific papers published since 2013 suggested clear links.
“We’re not going to reverse climate change on any conceivable timescale. So the conditions that are happening now, they won’t go away,” Richard Betts, Head of Climate Impacts Research at Britain’s Met Office Hadley Centre, who co-authored the review, told a news conference in London on Monday.
The review found that climate change had led to an increase in the frequency and severity of what scientists call “fire weather” – periods with a high fire risk due to some combination of hotter temperatures, low humidity, low rainfall and strong winds.
The effects had not only been observed in Australia, but from the western United States and Canada, to southern Europe, Scandinavia, the Amazon and Siberia, the review found.
Globally, fire weather seasons have lengthened across about 25% of the Earth’s vegetated surface, resulting in about a 20% increase in the mean length of the fire weather season, according to observational data.
Betts said Australia was particularly vulnerable to fires since its land area had warmed by more than the rise in average global temperature of about 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times.
The World Meteorological Organization says the global temperature increase could hit 3-5 C this century – more than three times limits agreed in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement – if nothing is done to stop rising emissions.
“Temperature conditions in Australia are extreme at the moment but they are what we expect to happen on average in a world of three degrees of global warming,” Betts said. “It brings it home to you what climate change means.”
The review was carried out using ScienceBrief.org, a new online research platform set up by Britain’s University of East Anglia and Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research.
At least 28 people have been killed in the Australian fires that have destroyed 2,000 homes and razed 11.2 million hectares (27.7 million acres), nearly half the area of the United Kingdom.
After weeks of criticism over his handling of the crisis, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday he would propose a high-powered inquiry into the disaster, including the impact of climate change.

LONDON/BEIJING: An outbreak of pneumonia that has killed one person in China and infected 40 others appears to be linked to a single seafood market in the central city of Wuhan and has not spread beyond there so far, the World Health Organization said on Sunday.
The cluster of infections had raised fears of a potential epidemic after China said last week that the virus causing it was a previously unknown type but came from the same family of viruses that caused the SARS and MERS epidemics.

However, the WHO said the outbreak had not spread. The seafood market in Wuhan – a major domestic and international transport hub – is now closed and no cases have been reported elsewhere in China or internationally, it said.
“The evidence is highly suggestive that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan,” the WHO statement said, adding that the market was closed on Jan 1. “At this stage, there is no infection among healthcare workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission.”
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a separate statement late on Sunday that 4 additional patients have been released and that no new cases have been discovered as of Saturday.
Another 717 people deemed to be in close contact with the patients remain under medical observation, the authority said.
The WHO said last week that a newly emerging member of the ‘coronavirus’ family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks was the likely cause of the outbreak.
Coronaviruses can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some types cause less serious disease, while others can be far more severe.
Among 41 people confirmed as infected with the new viral pneumonia, one – a 61-year-old man with serious underlying medical conditions – died last week. Seven others are in critical condition, the Wuhan health authorities said.
The WHO said preliminary epidemiological investigations had found most cases were in people who either worked at or were frequent visitors to Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.
“To date, investigations are still under way to assess the full extent of the outbreak,” it added.

199,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/koalas-wallabies-endangered-by-australia-bushfires-ecological-disaster/,"MELBOURNE: The Australian government committed A$50 million to an emergency wildlife recovery program on Monday, calling the bushfires crisis engulfing the country “an ecological disaster” that threatens several species, including koalas and rock wallabies.
Huge wildfires have razed more than 11.2 million hectares (27.7 million acres), nearly half the area of the United Kingdom, destroying or severely damaging the habitats of several native animals.
Some estimates suggest as many as a billion animals, including livestock and domestic pets, have either died in the blazes or are at risk in their aftermath due to a lack of food and shelter.
“This has been an ecological disaster, a disaster that is still unfolding,” Treasurer Frydenberg told reporters on Monday as he visited the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, where 45 koalas were being treated for burns.
“We know that our native flora and fauna have been very badly damaged.”
Images of burned kangaroos, koalas and possums, along with footage of people risking their lives to save native animals have gone viral around the world. Knitters around the world have responded to a call to create thousands of protective pouches and blankets for injured wildlife.
The Australian division of the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) has advised the government of 13 animals whose habitats have been either destroyed or severely damaged. They include three critically endangered species: the southern corroboree frog, the regent honeyeater bird and the western ground parrot.
“Huge proportions of globally significant areas like the Gondwana Rainforestand Blue Mountains World Heritage Areas along with the Australian Alps and Western Australia’s Stirling Ranges have suffered catastrophic burns,” WWF said in an emailed statement.
Other animals at risk include koala populations across the southeast, the Kangaroo Island dunnart, glossy black cockatoo, long-footed potoroo, western ground parrot, Blue Mountains water skink, eastern bristlebird and the brush-tailed rock wallaby.
CARROT DROPS
In a mission dubbed Operation Rock Wallaby, national park staff used helicopters to air drop thousands of kilos of carrots and sweet potatoes to brush-tailed rock wallabies in remote areas of New South Wales state.
“The provision of supplementary food is one of the key strategies we are deploying to promote the survival and recovery of endangered species like the brush-tailed rock wallaby,” NSW environment minister Matt Kean said.
“The wallabies typically survive the fire itself, but are then left stranded with limited natural food as the fire takes out the vegetation around their rocky habitat.”
Frydenberg said the “iconic” koala would be a focus of national government funding, adding that the full extent of the damage would not be known until the fires are out – something experts say could be months away.
Threatened Species Commissioner Sally Box said an estimated 30% of koala habitat – eucalpyt woodlands, which they use for both food and shelter – in NSW state may have been lost. The koalas‘ heavy fur and tendency to climb higher when threatened are severe disadvantages in fast-moving bushfires.
Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley said reviews would be brought forward on whether certain koala populations should be listed as “endangered” rather than “vulnerable”.
“Everything that can be done to rescue and recover koala habitat, will be done, including innovative approaches that look at whether you can actually put a koala in an area that it hasn’t come from,” Ley said.

Meghan returns to Canada to be with baby Archie
Queen in crisis talks on plan for couple
Harry and Meghan want to step back from royal roles



LONDON: Meghan, the wife of Prince Harry, has gone back to Canada to be with their son after the couple provoked a rift with Britain’s royal family by unexpectedly announcing they would be stepping back from their roles to spend more time in North America.
Queen Elizabeth and other senior British royals were trying to calm the crisis by thrashing out a plan for Harry and Meghan after the couple blindsided the family by going public with their announcement without consultation.
The couple spent six weeks in Canada at the end of last year before returning to Britain and their first official engagement of 2020 was to visit Canada House to say thank you for what they said had been an “unbelievable” welcome.
Their baby son, Archie, remained in Canada as Harry and Meghan returned to announce that they would step back from royal duties and build a more “progressive” role for themselves.
Meghan has now returned to Canada to be with her son, a spokeswoman said.
The couple – formally the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – said they had been reflecting for months before making the decision, which would see them divide their time between Britain and North America to allow them and Archie the space they needed.
They also said they intended to become financially independent.
The couple, who spoke of their struggles dealing with the intense media attention in a TV interview last October, revealed their decision to step back from royal duties on Instagram, leaving senior royals hurt and disappointed.
Discussions over the future had only been at a preliminary stage and neither the queen nor Prince Charles – Harry‘s father and heir to the throne – were consulted on the release of their statement or its contents, a royal source said.
As the crisis engulfed the Windsors, aides who work for the queen, Charles, and Harry‘s elder brother William were trying to find a solution.
The royal source said it was hoped a successful outcome would take “days not weeks”.
“CRISIS TALKS”
“Queen fights to save monarchy,” the Daily Mirror said on its front page while the Sun tabloid spoke of “Crisis talks after couple defied Queen”.
While other members of the royal family have had paying jobs, it was not immediately clear how Harry, 35 and sixth in line to the throne, and Meghan, 38, could become what royal biographers said was effectively “half-royal” – and who would pay for their transatlantic lifestyles.
At the moment, nearly all of their income is provided by Charles’s Duchy of Cornwall estate, although the cost of their security – estimated by newspapers to be hundreds of thousands of pounds a year – is currently met by the government.
The Times newspaper said Charles might cut off their funding if they moved away from royal duties altogether, although public relations experts said they could use their global fame to make large sums through public speaking, endorsements or their own TV production company.
Six months ago Harry and Meghan applied to the UK Intellectual Property Office to trademark the phrases Sussex Royal and Sussex Royal Foundation for items ranging from books and charity campaigns to pyjamas and socks.
“The monarchy needs to be asked serious questions about what they’re up to, it’s not good enough to be told to wait for clarification or to be left reading the tea leaves to work out what their intentions are,” said Graham Smith, from campaign group Republic, which wants to abolish the royals.
A YouGov poll of 1,327 Britons found that 45% supported the couple’s decision to step away from royal life but 63% believed their Duchy of Cornwall funding should end.

202,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/women/one-woman-reports-a-rape-every-15-minutes-in-india/,"NEW DELHI: One woman reported a rape every 15 minutes on average in India in 2018, according to government data released on Thursday, underlining its dismal reputation as one of the worst places in the world to be female.
The highly publicised gang rape and murder of a woman in a bus in New Delhi in 2012 brought tens of thousands onto the streets across India and spurred demands for action from film stars and politicians, leading to harsher punishments and new fast-track courts. But the violence has continued unabated.
Women reported almost 34,000 rapes in 2018, barely changed from the year before. Just over 85% led to charges, and 27% to convictions, according to the annual crime report released by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Women’s rights groups say crimes against women are often taken less seriously, and investigated by police lacking in sensitivity.
“The country is still run by men, one (female prime minister) Indira Gandhi is not going to change things. Most judges are still men,” said Lalitha Kumaramangalam, former chief of the National Commission for Women.
“There are very few forensic labs in the country, and fast-track courts have very few judges,” said Kumaramangalam, a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The rape of a teenager in 2017 by former BJP state legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar gained national attention when the accuser tried to kill herself the following year, accusing the police of inaction.
Five months before Sengar was convicted last December, the accuser’s family had to be provided with security after a truck crashed into the car she was in, injuring her and killing two of her relatives.
A 2015 study by the Centre for Law & Policy Research in Bengaluru found that fast-track courts were indeed quicker, but did not handle a high volume of cases.
And a study in 2016 by Partners for Law in Development in New Delhi found that they still took an average of 8.5 months per case – more than four times the recommended period.
The government statistics understate the number of rapes as it is still considered a taboo to report rape in some parts of India, and because rapes that end in murder are counted purely as murders.

203,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australias-bushfires-make-massive-clouds-of-pollution/,"Smoke from Australia’s bushfires has blanketed its major cities over the past month, turned the sky over New Zealand bright orange and left sooty deposits on its glaciers and drifted across the Pacific to South America.
Reuters used readings from NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office showing hourly estimates of the amount of organic carbon released into the atmosphere to create an animation showing the spread of smoke.
On January 6, this amounted to an area of about 17 million sq km (6.5 million sq miles).
The organic carbon contains a substantial portion of fine particles known as PM2.5, which can have a major impact on health and climate.
The tiny particulate matter can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the blood. It has been linked to heart disease, strokes and cancer.
The UN World Meteorological Organization said on Tuesday that the brown sooty deposits reported on New Zealand’s glaciers could accelerate the rate at which they are melting.
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifications for 24-hour mean exposure to PM 2.5 give an indication of how bad air quality is. A reading of anything above 250 micrograms is considered “hazardous” the worst classification on the scale.
In Australia, air pollution readings in some towns have been off the charts. One station in Goulburn, New South Wales, recorded a reading of more than 2,000 micrograms. This is higher than data recorded in the Indian capital of Delhi its heavily polluted winter.
Skies as far away as central Chile have gone grey due to the smoke. The Japanese weather satellite Himawari captured an image of a plume of smoke crossing the Pacific Ocean toward South America on Sunday.
The fires, which have raged for months in Australia, have already emitted 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide, according to the EU’s Copernicus monitoring programme.
Since October, 27 people have been killed and thousands subjected to repeat evacuations as the unpredictable fires scorched more than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 million acres), an area the size of South Korea.
An end to the ordeal is not in sight, with one state official warning on Friday that the fires could burn for weeks.
“There is a long way to go in what has been an unprecedented fire event … we know that we have many weeks of the fire season to run,” Daniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria state, told a televised briefing.

LONDON: A cluster of more than 50 pneumonia cases in the central Chinese city of Wuhan may be due to a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly SARS and MERS outbreaks, World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.
While the United Nations health agency said it needed more comprehensive information to confirm precisely the type of pathogen causing the infections, it said a new coronavirus was a possibility.
But on Thursday, Chinese state television was more conclusive, citing pathogen test results from a preliminary assessment expert group.
“As of January 7, 2020, the laboratory detected a new type of coronavirus,” China Central Television (CCTV) said in a report. “The new coronavirus that caused this epidemic situation is different from previously discovered human coronaviruses, and further understanding of the virus requires more scientific research.”
The CCTV report did not identify the laboratory or the expert group.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Some of the virus types cause less severe disease, while some – like the one that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) – are far more severe.
“The initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan…pointed to a coronavirus as a possible pathogen causing this cluster,” the WHO said in a statement.
It added that since Chinese authorities have conducted laboratory tests and eliminated the SARS coronavirus and the MERS one as possible causes, as well as flu, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens, “therefore, a novel coronavirus could not be ruled out”.
The pneumonia outbreak started last month, and 59 cases had been reported by Chinese authorities by Sunday.
The WHO noted that coronaviruses emerge periodically – including in 2002 to cause SARS and in 2012 to cause MERS.
It said that according to Chinese authorities, the virus behind the Wuhan cases can cause severe illness in some patients and does not appear to pass easily from person to person.
“More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen, as well as to better understand the epidemiology of the outbreak, the clinical picture, the investigations to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection, and the countermeasures implemented,” the WHO said.
In 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries in 2003. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.

At least nine women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in a week at Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital.
According to Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital, cervical cancer was diagnosed in 216 women from 14 April till 17 September 2019. The hospital, however, is yet to come up with compiled data for 2019.
As many as 393 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2018 at the hospital. Record maintained by the hospital showed that 462 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2017, 492 in 2016, 222 in 2015 and 191 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2014.
“Causes and risk factors for cervical cancer include human papilloma virus infection, having multiple sexual partners, engaging in early sexual contact, involvement in multiple sexual relations as human papilloma virus is mainly transmitted through sexual contact.

Delivering more number of children is also a cause for cervical cancer,” according to Dr Ujjwal Raj Chalise, head of Department of Radiation at Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital.
Cervical cancer is the most common form of cancer among Nepali women.
“Immunisation with HPV vaccine reduces the impact of cervical cancer. It’s ideal for girls to receive the vaccine before they have sexual contact and are exposed to HPV,” said Dr Chalise.
The government has vaccinated girls studying at Grades VI and VII of Chitwan and Kaski districts as part of its pilot project to reduce cervical cancer in the country.
The government has also aimed to administer human papilloma virus vaccination in all adolescent girls across the country through its national immunisation programme.
But the government’s plan is still in a state of limbo.
“The government’s decision to administer human papilloma virus vaccine came last year when no preparation was made. Age, amount, time duration between the first and second doses and other variants should be decided before taking decision on immunisation.
But there weren’t any preparations then,” said Dr Jhalak Gautam, chief of Child Health and Immunisation Section at Family Welfare Division.
“The National Advisory Committee on Immunisation should first pass all decisions regarding immunisation and then only the government will grant approval. Though we have been holding discussions and are working to include HPV vaccine in the regular immunisation list, we can’t provide the vaccination in the current fiscal,” said Dr Gautam.
“Cancer of cervix can be detected at precancerous stage through screening with Pap smear test.
The disease can be prevented and treated successfully if the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. Also human papilloma virus vaccination helps prevent cervical cancer,” said Dr Chalise.
Common symptoms of cervical cancer are abnormal vaginal bleeding, odorous discharge, bleeding after going through menopause, pain during sex, and pelvic pain. Anyone experiencing these symptoms is advised to visit hospital immediately, as per Dr Chalise.
In 2018 approximately 311,000 women died of cervical cancer. More than 85 per cent of these deaths occurred in low and middle-income countries, according to World Health Organisation.
Cervical cancer awareness month is celebrated every year in January.

206,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australias-leaders-unmoved-on-climate-action-after-devastating-bushfires/,"MELBOURNE: Australia’s government is sticking firmly to a position that there is no direct link between climate change and the country’s  devastating bushfires, despite public anger, the anguish of victims and warnings from scientists.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, say Australia does not need to cut carbon emissions more aggressively to limit global warming, even after a three-year drought and unprecedented bushfires.
Instead they say Australia, which contributes 1.3% of the world’s carbon emissions but is the second-largest emitter per capita behind the United States, should be rewarded for beating its emissions reduction targets for 2020.
“When it comes to reducing global emissions, Australia must and is doing its bit, but bushfires are a time when communities must unite, not divide,” Taylor said in emailed comments to Reuters on Tuesday, while he was busy at bushfire relief centres in his constituency in New South Wales state.
Stepping up efforts to cut emissions would harm the economy, the government argues, especially if it hurt Australia’s exports of coal and gas. The country last year overtook Qatar as the world’s top exporter of liquefied natural gas.
“In most countries it isn’t ­acceptable to pursue emission­reduction policies that add substantially to the cost of living, ­destroy jobs, reduce incomes and impede growth,” Taylor wrote in The Australian newspaper on December 31.
“That’s why we won’t adopt (opposition) Labor’s uncosted, reckless, economy-destroying targets that will always result in a tax on ­energy, whether it is called that or not.”
Taylor did not detail exactly how cutting emissions would raise the cost of living.
Australians have complained that due to a lack of energy policy, power prices have risen substantially in recent years placing a heavy burden on household incomes, even as energy producers are gradually shifting to cheaper renewables.
Taylor’s came in response to criticism Australia faced at the United Nations climate summit in Madrid for blocking ambitious action to cut carbon emissions.
Environmental groups say Australia will only meet its emissions targets by including old carbon credits the government wants to count from the 1992 Kyoto Protocol.
Scientists say climate change is a key factor in the destructive wildfires.
“One of the key drivers of fire intensity, fire spread rates and fire area is temperature. And in Australia we’ve just experienced record high temperatures,” said Mark Howden, director of the Climate Change Institute at Australian National University.
The burning forests are a double whammy for the environment, as they add to carbon emissions while also removing carbon sinks which will take decades to grow back, said David Holmes, director of the Monash University Climate Change Communication Research Hub.
Australia’s bushfires since September have emitted about 350 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equal to two-thirds the country’s annual emissions from man-made sources, estimated Pep Canadell, director of the Global Carbon Project, based on data from NASA satellites.
To others, from opposition Labor to film star Russell Crowe, who skipped the Golden Globes awards to fight bushfires in Australia, to US Senator Bernie Sanders, the link is clear between climate change and Australia’s fires which have killed 25 people, destroyed thousands of homes and razed more than 8 million hectares (20 million acres) of land since September.
“I say to those who are delaying action on climate change: look at the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires,” Sanders said on social media last week.
Amid an outbreak of fires in several states in November, Labor leader Anthony Albanese urged Morrison to beef up resources to prepare for, fight and prevent disasters.
“The fire season is starting earlier and finishing later, and emergency leaders agree that extreme weather events in Australia will only increase in severity and frequency, due to climate change,” Albanese wrote in the November 22 letter, which he posted on social media.

207,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/local-authorities-mysterious-illness-in-china-is-not-sars/,"BEIJING: The mysterious respiratory illness that has infected dozens of people in a central Chinese city is not SARS, local authorities said Sunday.
The 2002-2003 SARS epidemic started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere. Fears of a SARS recurrence arose this month after a slate of patients were hospitalised with an unexplained viral pneumonia in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province.

As of Sunday, 59 people were diagnosed with the condition and have been isolated while they receive treatment, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.
The commission said in a statement that initial investigations have ruled out SARS — severe acute respiratory syndrome — as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza, bird flu and adenovirus.
The commission previously said the condition’s most common symptom was fever, with shortness of breath and lung infections appearing in a “small number” of cases. There were no clear indications of human-to-human transmission.
Several patients were working at the South China Seafood City food market in sprawling Wuhan’s suburbs. The commission said the market would be suspended and investigated.
Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority said Sunday that a total of 15 patients in Hong Kong were being treated for symptoms including fever and respiratory infection after recent visits to Wuhan.
Hospitals and doctors have been directed to report cases of fever in anyone who has traveled to Wuhan in the past 14 days, Hong Kong’s health chief, Sophia Chan, said Sunday.
The hospital authority said it has activated a “serious response” level to curb spread of the infection. Chan warned Hong Kong residents against visiting wet markets and eating wild game in mainland China.
The World Health Organization said it was closely monitoring the situation and maintaining contact with Chinese authorities. No travel or trade restrictions are necessary at this time, the WHO said.

SYDNEY: It has been described as Australia’s Galapagos Islands and has long been a refuge for some of the country’s most endangered creatures. But devastating wildfires over recent days have undone decades of careful conservation work on Kangaroo Island and have threatened to wipe out some of the island’s unique fauna altogether.
Experts working on the island say the fires have killed thousands of koalas and kangaroos, and also have raised questions about whether any members of a mouse-like marsupial species that carries its young in a pouch have survived. Similarly, it remains unclear how many from a unique flock of glossy black-cockatoos got away from the flames and whether they have a future on an island where much of their habitat has gone up in smoke.
Located off the coast of South Australia state, Kangaroo Island is about 50% larger than Rhode Island and home to 4,500 people and what was a thriving ecotourism industry. But the wildfires that have been ravaging swaths of Australia have burned through one-third of the island, killing a father and his son and leaving behind a scorched wasteland and a devastated community.
They also have left people scrambling to help the critters that have survived.
“Caring for all these animals is quite amazing,” said Sam Mitchell, co-owner of the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park. “However, we are seeing a lot that are too far gone. We are seeing kangaroos and koalas with their hands burned off — they stand no chance. It’s been quite emotional.”
Inspired in part by the late Australian wildlife expert Steve Irwin, Mitchell and his wife, Dana, bought the commercial park seven years ago in their early 20s, and have been renovating the place and taking in rescue animals since.
On Friday night with the fire approaching, Dana fled with their 18-month-old son, Connor, while Sam stayed behind to defend the park and their dream. A wind change spared the park from the wildfire’s path.
Mitchell said the fires have killed thousands of koalas on the island, a particularly devastating loss because the creatures have remained largely disease-free there, while many koalas on mainland Australia suffer from chlamydia.
The couple are currently caring for about 18 burned koalas, and they’ve had to euthanize many more.
Meanwhile, Heidi Groffen could do nothing, as all eight monitoring stations she and her partner had set up to keep track of the mysterious Kangaroo Island dunnart, the mouse-like marsupial, melted in the flames.
An ecologist and coordinator for the nonprofit Kangaroo Island Land for Wildlife, Groffen said the population of 300 or so dunnarts may have been wiped out altogether because they are too small to outrun wildfires, although she remains hopeful that some may have sheltered in rock crevices.
“Even if there are survivors, there is no food for them now,” she said. “We’re hoping to bring some into captivity before they are completely gone.”
She said the creatures have long fascinated her because so little is known about them.
Also uncertain is the future for the 400 or so Kangaroo Island glossy black-cockatoos. Once prevalent on the South Australia mainland, the birds retreated to the island after humans destroyed much of their traditional habitat.
“Unlike some of the other animals, the birds are in the best position to escape. They can get away from the fires a bit more,” said Daniella Teixeira, who is working on a doctoral degree about the birds at The University of Queensland.
But much like the dunnarts, the cockatoos could find they don’t have enough food left on the island, particularly because they eat only from a single type of tree known as a drooping she-oak. And many hot spots on the island continue to burn.
Teixeira said careful conservation work over the past 25 years has seen the glossy black-cockatoo population increase from 150, but those gains have been wiped out in the space of a week.
She said she is currently writing the final chapter of the thesis she began in 2016, but that suddenly everything has changed.
“It’s pretty hard to sit here and write a paper on them when I don’t know their status today,” she said.

210,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/ts-eliot-letters-show-love-for-muse-but-poet-downplays-it/,"PHILADELPHIA: Recently unveiled letters from TS Eliot to his muse Emily Hale show how much he loved his longtime friend, but a statement from beyond the grave by the poet himself dismisses his feelings and shows how Eliot tries to rewrite the narrative of their relationship, scholars say.
Hale donated Eliot’s letters to Princeton University Library more than 60 years ago with instructions that they could only be opened 50 years after she and Eliot died.


The day they were made available at the Ivy League school, Eliot’s statement, written five years before his death, was released — as per his own instructions.
In it, Eliot downplays his love for Hale.
“I came to see that my love for Emily was the love of a ghost for a ghost,” he wrote.
Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, who was among the first to read the letters at the New Jersey school Thursday, said it was “unfortunate” that Eliot felt he had to deny his feelings for Hale.
“That seemed a little harsh,” Dickey said. “She was his muse for many years.”
Letters to Hale from 1930 — contained in the first of 14 boxes — show Eliot confessing his love for her.
“They are extremely passionate,” Dickey said. “It’s really more than what I expected. They are very emotional, claiming that she inspired a lot of his poetry. She obviously played a really important role in his poetic life.”
Dickey said it’s become more obvious that the “hyacinth girl” in “The Waste Land,” Eliot’s most famous poem, is Hale.
Also among the boxes of letters is a manuscript Hale wrote about their relationship. Her account and his early letters trace the same narrative, Dickey said.
In his statement, Eliot does admit he once loved Hale.
“I fell in love with Emily Hale in 1912,” he wrote. He told her so two years later.
“I have no reason to believe, from the way in which this declaration was received, that my feelings were returned,” Eliot wrote.
He married his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, in 1915, a year after his declaration. The two had a tumultuous, loveless marriage marred by Haigh-Wood’s mental illness and alleged infidelity. They separated in 1933.
“Emily Hale would have killed the poet in me; Vivienne nearly was the death of me, but she kept the poet alive,” Eliot wrote.
Hale eventually developed feelings for Eliot, but the poet writes that, as time went on, he realized “more and more how little Emily Hale and I had in common.”
“It may be too harsh, to think that what she liked was my reputation rather than my work,” he wrote.
Eliot scholar Anthony Cuda called that a “cold and untrue statement.”
“He pursued her,” he said. “His earliest letters were ardent declarations of love. It’s not as if she chased after him.”
In other letters, Eliot comments on the pain and happiness of intimacy, according to Dickey, and even confesses his craving for alcohol and reveals details about his private life.
Hundreds of letters still need to be read; only a few copies can be seen at a time at the library, and there are no copies available online.
There are a few different reasons Eliot might be trying to rewrite history, the scholars say. Hale donated the letters while the two were still alive, and Eliot feared they might be released before the embargo date. Eliot had ordered the letters he’d received from Hale destroyed.
“He was looking back on this and felt embarrassed and ashamed at the openness and vulnerability he allowed to come through at the time,” Cuda said. “He tried to do damage control.”
But he also wanted to protect his  second wife , Valerie, whom he calls his one true love.
“But it’s a strange protectiveness,” Cuda said. “He was so devoted to Valerie and she to him. What the Emily Hale letters reveal — (Valerie) wasn’t the unique love of his life. He had a unique and tense experience before her.”
The letters could reveal much more about Eliot’s private and poetic life and are already making waves among the literary community. Cuda called them “all we could have hoped for.”
“What we want to do as consumers of the lives of others is simply understand them,” he said. “As usual, Eliot won’t be simplified.”

211,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/bushfires-rage-out-of-control-across-southeast-australia/,"SYDNEY/MELBOURNE: Bushfires burned dangerously out of control on Australia‘s east coast on Saturday, fanned by high temperatures and strong winds that had firefighters battling to save lives and property, as a change in wind conditions merged several large fire fronts.
By late evening, Victoria had 14 fires rated at emergency or evacuate warning levels, and New South Wales had 11 rated emergency, with more than 150 others burning across the states. New fires had started, and others had broken containment lines.
“There are a number of fires that are coming together – very strong, very large, intense fires that are creating some of these fire-generated thunderstorms,” New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said at an evening briefing.
“And unfortunately we’ve still got many hours to go off these elevated and dangerous conditions.”
The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said conditions were deteriorating rapidly as a gusty southerly wind change pushed up the coast and smoke plumes from the fires triggered storms.
Authorities are worried the fires could turn out to be worse than New Year’s Eve, when they burnt massive tracts of bushland and forced thousands of residents and summer holidaymakers to seek refuge on beaches.
In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews said while conditions were difficult, the job of firefighters had been made easier by tens of thousands of people following advice to evacuate.
It may be Sunday or later before damage assessments can be made. Prime Minister Scott Morrison put the national death toll from the current fire season, which began in September, at 23. Twelve of those are from this week’s fires alone.
In updates, the NSW RFS repeatedly delivered the same blunt advice to those who had not evacuated at-risk areas: “It is too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches.”
Residents used social media to post photos of the sky turning black and red from the smoke and glare of the fires, including in the Victorian town of Mallacoota, where around 1,000 people were evacuated by sea on Friday.
The first of those evacuees arrived near Melbourne on Saturday morning after a 20-hour journey by boat and a second ship with about 1,000 people landed in the afternoon.
The federal government announced an unprecedented call up of army reservists to support firefighters as well other resources including a third navy ship equipped for disaster and humanitarian relief.
Andy Gillham, the incident controller in the Victorian town of Bairnsdale, said the area had avoided the worst of the fires on Saturday but stressed this was an exceptional fire season.
“In a normal year, we would start to see the fire season kick off in a big way around early January and we’re already up towards a million hectares of burnt country. This is a marathon event and we expect to be busy managing these fires for at least the next eight weeks,” he said.
Following are highlights of what is happening across Australia:

Temperatures topped 45C (113F) in much of the Sydney metropolitan area, with Penrith recording a high of 48.9C (120F) according to the BOM. Canberra, the national capital, recorded a temperature of 44C just after 4 pm, which the chief minister said was a record for the territory.
As the fires have flared, many towns have been isolated as major and minor roads are closed. Some fires are generating their own storm systems, which create the risk of lightning strikes generating new fires.
A late southerly wind change on Saturday dramatically lowered temperatures but also brought wind gusts of 70-80 km per hour (43-50 miles per hour) that caused some major fires near the border of Victoria and New South Wales states to merge and strengthen.
In South Australia, two people died on Kangaroo Island, a popular holiday spot not far off the coast. South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said more than 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) have burned there, about one-quarter of the total area.
Six people remain unaccounted for in Victoria, Premier Andrews said on Saturday, down from 28 reported on Friday.
The focus on Saturday is preventing more loss of life, authorities said. National parks have been closed and people urged earlier this week to evacuate large parts of NSW’s south coast and Victoria’s northeastern regions, magnets for holidaymakers at the peak of Australia‘s summer school holidays.
Morrison confirmed that his visit to India and Japan scheduled for mid-January had been postponed due to the fires.
More than 5.25 million hectares (13 million acres) of land has been burnt this fire season.

JAKARTA: Floods that killed more than 50 people in Indonesia’s capital after the biggest rainfall since records began should be a wake-up call to climate change in one of the world’s biggest carbon emitters, environmental groups said.
But, despite the catastrophe in Southeast Asia’s biggest city, authorities see no greater impetus for more cuts to planned carbon dioxide emission reductions or other measures to address climate change.

The floods “should serve as a strong reminder to the government that things can’t be business as usual,” said Yuyun Harmono, a campaign manager at the Indonesian Forum for the Environment, the country’s biggest green group.
With one of the world’s longest coastlines Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, is extremely vulnerable to climate change. The metropolitan region of the capital Jakarta is home to 30 million people and parts of the city near the coast are sinking just as sea levels are rising.
However, the country is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of the greenhouse gases that are blamed for causing the climate crisis. It is also the world’s top exporter of both thermal coal and palm oil, whose cultivation has reduced the amount of carbon dioxide absorbing forests.
At least 53 people were killed after the rains on New Year’s Day, Indonesian authorities said on Saturday. Nearly 175,000 people remain evacuated from their homes.
Indonesia’s meteorological department said it was the heaviest one-day rainfall since Dutch colonists began keeping records in 1866 and squarely blamed rising global temperatures.
“The impact of a one degree increase can be severe,” Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of the agency, told a news conference on Friday. “Among that is these floods.”
The floods were “a big wake up call,” said Hidayah Hamzah, a research analyst at the World Resources environmental group in Jakarta.
“WE DON’T CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT”
Social media users criticised the government for not doing enough on climate change after the flooding. Twitter user @wolfiecoconut said: “Indonesia is a country that is prone to disaster but we don’t care about the environment.”
But the green lobby has little sway in Indonesia.
Some 18% of Indonesians believe there is no link between human activity and climate change, one of the highest percentages among the world’s 23 biggest countries, according to the 2019 YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project.
When asked if the government would do more on climate issues after the floods, the Ministry of the Environment and Forest’s Climate Adaptation Director Sri Tantri Arundhati said on Friday there are no plans to change policy or shift the targets for cutting carbon dioxide output it agreed under the Paris Accord.
Rida Mulyana, director general for electricity at the energy ministry, said the government would stick to a plan for moving to renewables that means more than half of power generation will still rely on coal for the next decade.
Part of the government’s solution for Jakarta’s regular floods, which are not usually as bad as the recent ones, is to move the capital to the island of Borneo by 2023, a plan environmentalists fear will exacerbate deforestation.
Plans to improve Jakarta’s flood defences include building two dams and works on the city’s biggest river.
“There aren’t a lot of people who realize the impact of climate change,” said Nirwono Joga, a researcher at the Urban Studies Center in Jakarta.
“When the flood recedes and people get back to their homes and resume normal activities, flood management or concrete actions to combat climate change will be forgotten too.”

213,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/food/golden-globes-will-serve-plant-based-meal-at-awards-ceremony/,"LOS ANGELES: The Golden Globes, known as the “party of the year,” is going with a meatless menu for its 77th annual awards show.
Guests will be served a 100% plant-based meal just ahead of showtime Sunday. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association said Thursday that it wants the initiative to raise environmental awareness about food consumption and waste.

“If there’s a way we can, not change the world, but save the planet, maybe we can get the Golden Globes to send a signal and draw attention to the issue about climate change,” HFPA president Lorenzo Soria said. “The food we eat, the way we grow the food we eat, the way we dispose of the food is one of the large contributors to the climate crisis.”
The annual awards ceremony will air on NBC from The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California.
Soria said there was some initial push back about changing the menu just about two weeks before the show, but the hotel eventually agreed on the new menu.
“People were basically saying it’s too late, we’re ready with all the orders, the holidays and all that,” he said. “But after we began discussions, meeting for one or two days, (the hotel) accepted the change completely. They started to experiment with how to do plant-based meals that was not just their symbolic steps, but also something that guests will enjoy.”
Matthew Morgan, executive chef at The Beverly Hilton, called the menu change initially surprising. But he ultimately understood it would send a positive message.
“It was a little shocking when first mentioned, because of being very close to the actual Globes and having already decided on a menu,” he said. “But once we thought about it and the message that it sent, we were really excited about it. That’s something I stand behind myself.”
Items on the main entree include king oyster mushrooms scallops and wild mushroom risotto, along with roasted baby purple and green Brussels sprouts and carrots. A chilled golden beet soup will be served as an appetizer.
HFPA partnered with Icelandic Glacial, a naturally alkaline and sustainably-sourced natural spring water. The water will be served in glass bottles to eliminate plastic waste in the ballroom and red carpet, which is reused at other events throughout the year.
Soria called the food “excellent” after a recent taste-testing.
Morgan said making the change wasn’t too difficult. He said the first course was already vegan and the main course was a vegan alternate in which they enhanced the dish to add some “pop and color to the plate.”

After more than 60 years spent sealed up in a library storage facility, about 1,000 letters written by poet T.S. Eliot to confidante Emily Hale will be unveiled this week, and scholars hope they will reveal the extent of a relationship that’s been speculated about for decades.
Many consider Hale to not only be his close friend, but also his muse, and they hope their correspondence will offer insight into the more intimate details about Eliot’s life and work. Students, researchers and scholars can read the letters at Princeton University Library starting Thursday.
In this Oct. 14, 2019, photo, letters between poet T.S. Eliot and longtime confidante Emily Hale are displayed in Princeton, N.J. Thursday, Jan. 2, 2020 marks the first day that students, researchers and scholars can go to the Ivy League school in New Jersey to see these letters that many are saying may reveal more intimate details about Eliot’s life and work.

“I think it’s perhaps the literary event of the decade,” says Anthony Cuda, an Eliot scholar and director of the T.S. Eliot International Summer School. “I don’t know of anything more awaited or significant. It’s momentous to have these letters coming out.”
Lifelong friends, Hale and Eliot exchanged letters for about 25 years beginning in 1930. The two met in 1912 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but did not rekindle their friendship until 1927. Eliot was already living in England and Hale taught drama at U.S. universities, including Scripps College in California.
In 1956, Hale donated the letters under an agreement they wouldn’t be opened until 50 years after either her or Eliot’s death, whichever came second. Eliot died in 1965. Hale died four years later.
Biographers say Eliot ordered Hale’s letters to him to be burned.
Their relationship “must have been incredibly important and their correspondence must have been remarkably intimate for him to be so concerned about the publication,” Cuda says.
T.S. Eliot was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1888 and gained notoriety as a poet early in life. He was only 26 when “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” became his first professionally published poem.
Eliot’s 1939 book of whimsical poetry, “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats,” was adapted into “Cats,” the award-winning musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The play opened in London first in 1981 and then on Broadway the next year. It was then turned into a feature film starring an ensemble cast that includes Judi Dench and James Corden just released in December.
His best known works include “The Waste Land,” “The Hollow Men” and “Four Quartets.”
The first poem in the “Quartets” series, called “Burnt Norton,” piques the interest of enthusiasts of the poet, says Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, because of lines that suggest missed opportunities and what might have been with his muse. The poem is named after a home in England that Eliot visited with Hale in 1934.
“His relationship with her seems to be deep and meaningful and it’s a door he chose not to open,” she said.
The letters could also reveal details about Eliot’s conversion to Anglicanism, something he deeply cherished, Dickey says.
Dickey, who served as one of the editors on “The Complete Prose of T.S. Eliot”, said the poet was deeply ashamed of his marriage to his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, whom he was with for more than 15 years. Dickey said the letters could reveal just how close he and Hale were and if the two ever considered marriage.
“Was this an epistolary romance they would carry across the Atlantic?” Dickey said. “What role did she play in his emotional life?”
Eliot’s letters to Hale began after that first marriage ended. Whatever else she was, Hale was a link to the life Eliot had left behind in the United States as a young man, Dickey said.
“He was really thinking more about the United States and his childhood during the period where he was in correspondence with Hale,” says Dickey. “I have a feeling that having a relationship with an American woman helped him to uncover his past in a way.”
The unsealed boxes, which also contain photographs, clippings and other ephemera, were actually opened at the library’s special collections area called Firestone Library in October for cataloging and digitizing. Daniel Linke, interim head of special collections at the library, was part of the team working on the 14 boxes. He said there was very minimal, if any, reading.
He said that scholars from around the world will be traveling to Princeton in the first days they are available since they are copyrighted and won’t be made available online.
“It will be the special collections equivalent of a stampede at a rock concert,” Linke said.

215,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/physical-activity-linked-to-sperm-quality/,"





Healthy young men who exercise regularly may have better quality semen than their sedentary peers, a study of sperm donors suggests.
Even though being overweight and sedentary has long been tied to low sex drive and an increased risk of infertility, less is known about how physical activity levels might impact semen quality among men without fertility issues, the study team notes in Human Reproduction.










For the current analysis, researchers analyzed thousands of sperm samples from hundreds of men who qualified to donate sperm based on their health history and semen quality. Donors needed healthy levels of three things that can make conception more likely: sperm concentration, or the amount of sperm released when men ejaculate; sperm morphology, meaning the ideal size and shape with an oval head and a long tail; and motility, or the ability of sperm to move through the female reproductive tract to reach an egg.
Men who got the most total exercise and logged the most time doing intense workouts had better sperm motility than men who got the least amounts of exercise, the study found.
“Regular exercise may improve semen quality parameters among healthy, non-infertile men,” said study co-author Dr. Yi-Xin Wang of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in Boston.
“But it’s hard to tell how much exercise, and how often and what type of workouts should men do for optimal fertility,” Wang said by email.
All of the 746 study participants volunteered as potential sperm donors at the Hubei Province Human Sperm Bank in China. They were 28 years old, on average, and had a healthy weight, at least a high school education, no sexually transmitted diseases and no history of radiation exposure.
Researchers asked participants how often they exercised, and how intensely, as well as what other activities they did. Then, the study team scored participants’ exercise levels and intensity based on a measure known as metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week.
Light activities like walking or housework earn fewer points toward the total MET minutes per week than intense workouts like running or cycling.
Overall, half of the men in the study got at least 2,245.5 MET minutes a week. The least active men got only around 526.5 MET minutes, while the most active men got about 7,082.3 MET minutes.
While higher MET levels were associated with increased sperm motility, the men’s sperm concentration and morphology didn’t appear to vary based on how much exercise they got.
The amount of time men spent in sedentary pursuits like working at a computer or watching television also didn’t appear to impact any parameters of semen quality.
One drawback of the study is that it only measured activity levels at a single point in time. Another limitation is that researchers only focused on healthy men who were eligible to donate sperm.
Some previous research also suggests that excessive exercise is associated with infertility, said Dr. Muhammad Imran Omar, a researcher at the University of Aberdeen in the UK who wasn’t involved in the study.
“Therefore, it is important that the exercise should be done in moderation,” Omar said by email.
Even though the study didn’t find sedentary time associated with lower quality sperm, sitting too much is associated with other health problems like diabetes, obesity and heart disease that can in turn make it harder for couples to conceive, said Dr. Joan Khoo of Changi General Hospital in Singapore.
People who want to conceive should still try to limit sedentary time, Khoo, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.
“If your job is mostly sedentary, take every opportunity to get out of the chair or vehicle; stand, walk or climb stairs whenever you can,” Khoo advised. “Park the car some distance away or get down one bus stop earlier, and exercise as much as possible when not at work.”

A meeting of the House of Representatives chaired by Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal lawmaker Mahanta Thakur today announced that the HoR speaker would be elected on January 26.
Thakur chaired the meeting as the senior-most lawmaker after Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahangphe tendered her resignation to the Parliament Secretariat. She announced her resignation in a separate meeting held earlier in the day.
The central secretariat of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) had yesterday decided to nominate Agni Prasad Sapkota as the candidate for the HoR speaker. This decision forced Tumbahangphe to resign as the constitution does not allow appointment of speaker and deputy speaker from the same party.
The latest developments end the months-long impasse due to delay on the part of NCP co-chairs KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal in deciding a candidate for the speaker’s post. The delay was as Oli and Dahal favoured different candidates.
While Oli was in favour of former speaker Subas Chandra Nembang, Dahal was under pressure from his former CPN-MC colleagues not to forego the speaker’s post they were allocated before they merged with the former CPN-UML to form the NCP.
The delay also forced postponement of the HoR meeting thrice this Bill Session that kicked off on December 20.
With the announcement of date for speaker election, the Parliament Secretariat this evening published the schedule for the election.
As per the schedule, nominations for the post will be filed tomorrow from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm.
As per the process of filing nominations, a member of the HoR will register a proposal notice in the Parliament Secretariat that another member be appointed as speaker. The same day, the Parliament Secretariat will publish the list of candidature notices at 2:30 pm.
On January 26, the lawmaker registering the proposal will again propose in the HoR that the particular HoR member be appointed speaker, while another lawmaker will support the proposal. The House will then discuss the candidature notices and the candidature proposals will be presented in the House for voting.
If the first proposal garners two-thirds majority, rest of the proposals will not be presented for voting. If there’s only one proposal, the House will announce unanimous election of the speaker.
Other political parties represented in the HoR, except the RJP-N, have not yet decided whether to field the candidate for speaker election.
RJP-N lawmaker Laxman Lal Karna said the party would not field a candidate for the speaker election.
The main opposition Nepali Congress has called a meeting of the executive body of its parliamentary party tomorrow morning to decide on the matter, said NC Whip Pushpa Bhusal. Earlier, there were reports that the NC would field Bhusal to contest speaker’s post.
Socialist Party Nepal leader Ram Sahay Yadav said the party would take a decision soon.
With the post of deputy speaker also falling vacant after Tumbahangphe’s resignation, Parliament Secretariat Spokesperson Dhashrath Dhamala said the election for deputy speaker would be held in the second phase. “The election for deputy speaker will be held on the direction of the speaker,” he said.
It is still not clear who will become the next deputy speaker, as the ruling NCP, the party having nearly two-thirds majority in the House, has not yet decided which candidate from which party to support.
The NCP cannot have deputy speaker’s post due to constitutional provision.
Sources said it had been tentatively agreed that the RJP-N would be allocated the deputy speaker’s post and the RJP-N would support the NCP candidate for speaker.
“Most probably, it will be Chanda Chaudhary from RJP-N,” the source said.

Shiva Maya Tumbahangphe, who resigned from the post of deputy speaker today, said patriarchy was stronger than monarchy in Nepal.
Speaking at a press conference after she submitted her resignation to the Parliament Secretariat, Tumbahanghpe said deeply-rooted and institutionalised patriarchy could not end just by the efforts of a few individuals. “We threw away monarchy easily, but changing patriarchal mindset will certainly take some time and hard work,” she said.
Although Tumbahangphe had also staked her claim to the speaker’s post, she was forced to resign as per constitutional provisions after the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) decided to retain the top post. The NCP has nominated Agni Sapkota as candidate for the post that fell vacant after former speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara was arrested in October on the charge of attempt to rape.
Tumbahangphe claimed it was she who emerged ultimate winner because she was successful in protecting the Parliament from political parties’ diktats.
Last week, NCP co-chairs KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal had asked Tumbahangphe to resign so that the process of electing speaker could begin. Tumbahangphe had refused to put in her papers, stating that she would quit only after the party decided on the candidate.
Tumbahangphe said as the leader of the House it was her duty to ensure independence of the constitutional institution. “Who becomes speaker is secondary. Had I succumbed to the party’s direction, I would have to forever face questions,” she said. “I proved that a constitutional post holder should not resign bowing to pressure from the ruling party.”
She added that she did not want to render the HoR leaderless by resigning well before the party decided on a candidate as the constitution did not envisage a leaderless House.
“I staked claim to the speaker’s post and it was natural. But I had also said I would resign if the party decided on a different candidate. Therefore, today I resigned, not on the party’s direction, but as per the constitution,” she said.
She expressed disappointment that she was repeatedly asked whose backing she had to stay firm on her stand. “I didn’t need any individual or institution’s backing. I had the constitution’s backing. The constitution is above everything. Whatever I did all along was in line with the constitution,” she added.
In her address to the House before she tendered her resignation, Tumbahangphe said she honoured her stand by clearing the way for the election of the new speaker.
Stressing the need for an all inclusive democratic system, Tumbahangphe said actions and practice, not just words, were instrumental in honouring the very essence of a democracy. “I hope political parties and leaders represented in this Parliament agree with me when I say that inclusion
and representation of all segments of society in upper tiers of the state will further and truly strengthen democracy.”
She added, “I am grateful that I, as a single indigenous woman, got the opportunity to lead this esteemed organ. I will continue to contribute to the creation of a prosperous and a just society through some other role.”

KATHMANDU: Rescuers in Nepal called off efforts on Monday to find seven people, including four South Korean trekkers, after fresh avalanches hit the Annapurna region where the group went missing last week, an official said.
Three Nepali guides were among the group struck by an avalanche on Friday along the popular trekking route at the base of Mount Annapurna, the world’s 10th highest mountain, at 8,091 metres (26,545 feet).
A military helicopter flew an army search and rescue team and sherpa climbers to the area, but “bad weather, heavy snow and continuous avalanches” prevented them from landing, said Mira Acharya, a tourism department official.
“It is a big disaster and the government is concerned about the safety of tourists,” Acharya told Reuters. “Rescuers are on standby for a fresh search.”
The search will continue when the weather improves, she added.
About 200 people, including 140 foreign hikers, were evacuated from the area at the weekend, police official Binod Sharma said.
Avalanches and bad weather had also prevented a search on Sunday by seven rescuers from the Trekking Agents’ Association of Nepal, who reached the site at Deurali, about 150 km (90 miles) northwest of the capital, Kathmandu.
A helicopter equipped with a device to track signs of the trekkers in the snow also failed to pinpoint where the group of seven went missing, said Suraj Paudyal, an official of a private rescue company.
In 2018, five South Koreans and four Nepali guides on a Himalayan climbing expedition were flung to their deaths after a huge block of ice crashed over a cliff into a narrow mountain gorge.
The winter trekking season in Nepal, home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest, is drawing to a close this month. Nepal gets four percent of its GDP from tourism including trekking.

Ramkala Buda Thapa of Himali Rural Municipality-2 has been taking shelter in menstrual huts or chhau sheds during her menstruation for 14 years. After the menstrual huts were destroyed in the recent campaign led by police personnel, local representatives and women activists, she is still living outside her home but in shelters more unsafe than the chhau shed itself.

Thapa commented that she had to take shelter in shades and tents in the jungle nearby since her family members would not allow her at home.
Many other women in the district, like Ramkala, have now been put in a dilemma as they do not know where to live during their monthly cycle.
Initiative of the local administration and security personnel, carried out with the right intention — which is to reduce the risk women face living outside during menstruation — seems to have backfired. They are still compelled to stay outside their houses but in the absence of menstrual sheds, they are living in plastic tents and other temporary shades. Without mattresses or blankets, they are facing the cold weather without any respite.
Meanwhile, Nepal Police, local government, women activists, locals, along with organisations like SAHAS Nepal, Human Rights Campaign (HRC), PeaceWin, UNICEF, Save the Children, among others are continually making efforts to bring an end to the chhaupadi system.

At a discussion programme on ‘Lumbini Development Perspective’ here today, Minister Bhattarai stressed on the need to establish Buddha circuit to link various Buddhist shrines like Mayadevi Temple, Ramgram and Tilaurakot.
According to the minister, new plan was necessary to develop Lumbini as the past activities did not yield expected results. To attract investment for infrastructure development was imperative, he said, adding, that the province and local levels too should launch initiatives to conserve the historic and cultural heritage.
On the occasion, Vice-chair of Lubmini Development Trust Vikshu Maitteya shared information about activities conducted so far, for the development of Lumbini area.
New plans were essential to attract more tourists, he said. Secretary at the Prime Minister’s Office Narayan Prasad Bidari said the concept of smart cities should not be implemented in Lumini area because it already had its unique identity.
Chief Executive Officer at National Reconstruction Authority Sushil Gyawali said while carrying out development activities, local cultural identities must be protected.

Huge quantity of bricks readied to be baked in 62 brick kilns of Bhaktapur have been damaged by incessant rainfall in the past two days.
The rainfall damaged around one million pieces of raw bricks amounting to Rs 90 million, according to Natibhai Hyomba, president of Bhaktapur Brick Factory Entrepreneurs’ Association. Hyomba said, “More than 80 per cent of raw bricks were ruined by the rain. The rainfall that began since last Thursday night also affected furnace in the brick kilns.”
When there are no adequate raw bricks to be baked, there are only two options, either shut down the furnace or keep the fire burning with the help of coals, which would obviously increase the production cost.
However, he assured that it would not lead to hike in the price of bricks for the time being as they had enough stock of bricks to meet the market demand.
Given the grim scenario, he appealed to the local municipality and the government to subsidise tax for brick entrepreneurs. Besides the entrepreneurs, labourers working in the kiln have also borne the brunt of the damage caused to bricks as they have to bear 33 per cent of the loss as per the prevailing regulation, while 67 per cent of the loss would be borne by the concerned factory owner, according to Hyomba.
Ram Bahadur BK, one of the labourers, bemoaned that the rainfall and the subsequent damage of the bricks had caused financial loss to the workers.

The winter this year has seen westerly wind entering in the country several times, which is not a common phenomenon, according to meteorologists at the MFD, under the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology.
“The westerly wind that comes from Jammu Kashmir area of India to Nepal normally enters one or two times in the winter season, but this year the wind has been making its way into Nepal many times.
The wind deepens the temperature resulting in rainfall and even snowfall in higher altitude,” said Manju Basi, a meteorologist at MFD.
This winter season recorded lowest temperature of 0.6 degree Celsius on December 28 and lowest maximum temperature of 9.9 °C on January 3. Continues cloudy sky, winter rain and snow in high altitude for the last three weeks have made the Kathmandu residents feel colder this year as per meteorologists.

Of the total number of children visiting the endocrine out-patient department of Kanti Children’s Hospital, six per cent of them are found to be suffering from diabetes.
As many as 464 new patients had visited the endocrine department in the fiscal 2018-2019.
“Lack of understanding about the disease, insulin deficiency, changing lifestyle, consumption of sugary drinks and food, junk food items and obesity
are to be blamed for diabetes in children,” said Dr Subhana Thapa Karki, senior consultant paediatrician and paediatric endocrinologist at Kanti Children’s Hospital.
Type one diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Type two diabetes comprises the majority of people with diabetes around the world and is largely the result of excessive body weight and physical inactivity.
“Children in Nepal are basically found to be suffering from type one diabetes. Some of them are also suffering from type two diabetes,” said Dr Karki.
According to Kanti Children’s Hospital, 27 children including 14 males and 13 females were found to be suffering from diabetes in the fiscal 2017-2018. The number of children visiting the hospital with diabetes reached 29 in the fiscal 2018-2019.
If the blood sugar is not controlled in children, they are at risk of suffering from retinopathy — damage to the retina of the eyes, which may cause vision impairment, high blood pressure, neuropathy, dysfunction of nerves resulting numbness, tingling, muscle weakness, and complications in kidneys.
“Obesity in children is a risk factor for diabetes in them. Children these days spend more time playing games in electronic gadgets rather than playing games that demand their physical activities. Intake of sweet food items such as biscuits, ice-cream, bakery food items and junk food items are also contributing factors for increasing diabetes cases among children,” she said.
According to hospital data, the rate of children suffering from obesity/underweight is 20.7 per cent.
Though the children are found to be suffering from diabetes, many parents are not aware about its symptoms. Many children are brought to the hospital when the level of blood sugar goes too low. The children at times need to be admitted in the intensive care unit in the hospital when their condition worsens. It too can lead to morbidity in some children, as per the doctor.
Instead of bringing children to hospital only when the case is severe, parents or caretakers of the children should be informed about the symptoms of diabetes. Dry mouth and increased thirst, fatigue, frequent urination, weight loss, increased hunger, vaginal discharge in girls and cuts that heal slowly are some of the symptoms of diabetes in children, according to doctors.
“Instead of cutting down the food intake of children, it is necessary to provide them balanced diet for healthy growth and development. Timely treatment and avoiding junk food items can be helpful,” said Dr Karki.

Police then frisked her and ask Raut to take her coffee mug that she was carrying with her. But an angry-looking Raut leaves the mug on the table.
Raut was travelling from Kathmandu to Bhadrapur airport in Jhapa on her way to attend a musical show in India.
In a Facebook video recorded inside a vehicle after Raut landed in Bhadrapur airport, she accused the lady constable of addressing her in an insulting manner.
In the video, Raut looks angry and uses derogatory language against Nepal Police, accusing the police organisation of ineffective investigation into larger scams while troubling the general public. Police, however, have refuted Raut’s claim, saying no cop at the airport used foul language while talking to the singer.
People have expressed mixed feelings about the scandal on social media, with some siding with the police, while others sympathising with the singer. Police were criticised for deliberately leaking the CCTV footage after Raut’s accusation gained a lot of attention on social media.
Deputy Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati at MPR, Teku, said investigation in the case had begun and they would arrest Raut on her return to Nepal.
Raut could not be contacted for comment. She later removed the video lambasing Nepal Police from her Facebook page and posted another video, saying she was not against the police.
Indecent behaviour at public places can attract punishment of up to one year in jail.

Two teenagers, who left for Gosaikunda, Rasuwa, for hiking from Kathmandu, have been missing for the last two days in the thick snow-covered forest area of Langtang.
Japan Tamang, 19 and Yangul Sherpa, 19, resident of Suntakhan in Gokarneshwor Municipality had gone for hiking in Gosaikunda on January 13. They have been reportedly missing since January 17. Last time, Tamang had called his sister Sushmita Tamang on mobile phone at 5:18pm, asking her to credit his mobile balance.
According to Sushmita, her brother had informed her that he and his friend were lost in some forest area. Sushmita has not been able to contact her brother after that. Acting on the missing complaint lodged by Sushmita, police traced the last location of the mobile phone used by Japan. As per the location of the mobile, police have concluded that they might have gone missing in Langtang National Park, Rasuwa.  The area receives heavy snowfall at this time of the year.
﻿
District Administration Office, Rasuwa, launched the search operation yesterday, but it was not easy to deploy police personnel due to heavy snow in the area. Thus, it decided to hire a chopper for the search operation in the area, but that was not helpful for the search operation. Intensifying the search operation today, a Simrik Air helicopter was also used along with dozens of police personnel from Rasuwa and Sindhupalchowk and some Sherpa rescuers, but the missing teenagers could not be found.
Chief District Officer of Rasuwa Arjun Bhandari said, “We are searching for the teenagers in jungle area that lies between two local rivers — Hundi and Tandi. Our search team and locals have advised us that the duo must have been lost somewhere in that area, but we have not been able to found any clue yet.” Bhandari said the area had received some four feet thick layer of snow and the minimum temperature recorded in the area was minus 19 degree Celsius.
Japan and Yangul had moved towards Gosaikunda through Sindhupalchok district.
But as they reached Fedi they were stuck there for two days following the heavy rain and snowfall. They reportedly stayed at a hotel named ‘Red Panda’ until they made up their mind to return to Kathmandu on the third day.
“But they chose not to return through the same route so they took a new route to enter Kathmandu through Nuwakot district, which was a wrong decision,” CDO Bhandari said. The locals in Fedi informed that they were seen traveling on a road towards Ghang Fedi in Nuwakot district on January 17.

270,https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/health-system-needs-to-be-restructured/,"Over the years, the country has seen a surge in dengue and scrub typhus cases. Recently, a patient suspected of contracting novel coronavirus was admitted to a hospital. Whenever these cases surface, people start panicking because they do not fully trust the country’s health system. This is not good news for a country which has just rolled out a massive tourism campaign, Visit Nepal 2020, to attract at least two million foreign tourists. Sabitri Dhakal of The Himalayan Times talked to Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, a wing of the Department of Health Services, about government preparations to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the country. Excerpts:
Interview with Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, in Kathmandu on Saturday, January 18, 2020. Photo: Balkrishna Thapa Chhetri/THT
What is the situation of epidemiological surveillance in Nepal? What are the challenges and the course of action?
We have obtained mixed results so far. Achievements have been made in the last few years in controlling several communicable and tropical diseases such as malaria and lymphatic filariasis. The big challenge for us is emergence of new diseases and re-emergence of diseases that were eliminated in the past. The division looks into 20 kinds of neglected tropical diseases with a team of 25 people. These diseases include dengue, kala-azar, lymphatic filariasis, chikungunya, malaria and scrub typhus. Prevention of non-communicable diseases is another area we work on. We are conducting researches on the spread of such diseases. We have noticed that some vector borne diseases, which were limited to an area, are now spreading to other places because of change in weather conditions. So, climate change and lack of skilled human resources are hurdles for us. This has prevented us from fulfilling international commitments to eliminate some of the diseases within the deadline given to us. This calls for strengthening the surveillance system to detect more diseases and creating rapid response teams to deal with multidimensional hazards. For this, we need to communicate properly with the provincial and local governments and establish an autonomous body with proper systems and human resources to control spread of diseases.
Are you trying to say Nepal isn’t fully prepared to fight or deal with epidemiology outbreaks?
The measures we have taken to control the spread of diseases are not satisfactory. Our latest approach is to improve the capacity of provinces so that they can act as the first line responders and support the local level. Staffers of district hospitals have been trained to respond to the spread of any infectious or unknown disease. We have also trained doctors who teach community medicine at medical colleges on epidemic preparedness, pandemic health preparedness response and investigation of samples collected from the field. Preliminary trainings have been given on clinical capacity building, and epidemiological investigation and enhancement as well. But we need to strengthen the surveillance system in the country for early detection, treatment and prevention of the disease. This might take some time because we can’t make direct interventions at the local level and it is not possible to build the capacity of 753 local bodies overnight. It is unfortunate that some of the posts created in the past, such as focal person of rapid response teams, vector control officers at the district level and district tuberculosis officers have been removed since the country made a transition to the federal system of government. It took years to enhance capacity of those officials and create a system to continuously monitor and report the situation. All those efforts have been in vain. Today, we do not have a strong chain of command to control disease outbreaks and oversee epidemic preparedness and response. We also do not have dengue specialists, epidemiologists and entomologists with us. So, we need to overhaul the health system, train manpower, and create a strong team of specialists.
Does this imply that the shift to federal system of government has weakened the country’s health system?
The health system has been badly hit since we embraced federalism as it has eroded gains made in the past, making the country more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Today, we may not be able to handle emergency situations and respond to disease outbreaks as effectively as in the past because there is no clear line of communication and a clear chain of command. Restructuring of the health sector so far has been no more than a bureaucratic exercise. It has not properly understood the sensitivity of the health sector and system. The practice of transferring health workers haphazardly without considering their expertise has also backfired. We want the Ministry of Health and Population to address these issues.
Procurement and distribution of medicines at the local level have always been problematic. How are you dealing with this situation?
Medicines are procured by the management division of the Department of Health Services. However, we need to send drugs to treat malaria, lymphatic filariasis, leprosy, rabies and other diseases. But there is no coordination between the federal, provincial and local governments in distribution of medicines. We do not get information on inventories and use of medicines and
vaccines. Without these data, we cannot make forecasts and formulate plans. So, we must build an online reporting system so that all three governments can give updates on inventory and use in real time. We have asked the federal government to develop a national framework in this regard.
The country has just launched Visit Nepal 2020 campaign. What measures have been taken to control transmission of infectious diseases?
Greater cross-border movement of people and goods certainly poses a threat. Diseases such as influenza, ebola, dengue, scrub typhus and Zika virus enter the country from foreign lands and affect both Nepalis and foreigners. Since dengue cases have gone up in tourist destinations such as Chitwan and Pokhara, we need to improve sanitation and make necessary arrangements to provide proper treatment. So, on the one hand, we need to ensure that foreigners do not carry diseases to Nepal, while on the other, take preventive measures to make sure diseases that have entered Nepal do not spread rapidly.
Do health desks at Tribhuvan International Airport and land border points have proper equipment to screen the health condition of visitors?
We need to keep skilled human resources at those desks round-the-clock. But we do not have adequate number of trained human resources. We also lag behind in technology and we do not have adequate budget. These deficiencies have affected us. To prevent spread of diseases we need to screen everyone properly and isolate patients suffering from a disease on time. For that, we need equipment such as thermal scanners to detect fever and infrared detectors. A full-fledged facility should be in place at airports to screen patients, isolate those with diseases and transfer them to hospitals. At present, foreigners use eight land border points to enter the country. They are at Kakadbhitta, Biratnagar, Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Nepalgunj, Dhangadi, Pashupati Nagar and Rasuwa, but the health desks in Nepalgunj and Bhairahawa are not operational. We want the government to introduce a hassle-free process ensuring timely release of the budget to operate health desks at land border points.
At present, we are keeping records of people returning from Africa who are suspected of having contracted yellow fever. We have also started keeping records of travellers with respiratory illness symptoms following the outbreak of coronavirus in China.
What preparations has the government made to contain the spread of coronavirus infection in the country?
We are working closely with the National Public Health Laboratory and Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. We do not have laboratories to diagnose the disease. So we have to send the samples collected from people suspected of having contracted the disease abroad. But the World Health Organisation has given us a provisional guideline based on which we isolate those who are suspected of having contracted the disease. We definitely need to remain alert, but we need not panic because it has not been established that the virus can spread from one human to another. This is a new disease and there is no specific guideline to prevent its spread. It will be best if preventive measures taken to contain influenza are followed to prevent infection.
National Centre for Disease Control in New Delhi has already asked Nepal about the screening procedure and other measures deployed at Tribhuvan International Airport following the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, China. Could you please explain those procedures?
We are in routine communication with countries that follow international health regulations. International health regulations represent an agreement between 196 countries, including all World Health Organisation member states, to work together for global health security. We are in touch with other countries where patients suffering from such illnesses have been detected. We have already responded to requests made by foreign countries.
What measures are being taken to combat spread of dengue, scrub typhus and similar other diseases in the country, as cases of those diseases have gone up lately?
We have taken the support of international experts to train clinicians in all seven provinces. We have also prepared guidelines for management of those diseases. We will soon have new pumps to spray insecticides to contain malaria and other diseases, and training will be given on their use. We have held preliminary discussions to prepare contingency plans for hospitals as those facilities will see a surge in patients if there is an outbreak of such diseases. We want the Ministry of Health to deploy full-fledged teams comprising clinicians and entomologists at federal, provincial and local levels. Also, authority should be given to provinces to hire the required number for human resources if there is an outbreak. We should begin this process now because it will take a few years to train these people and make them ready to handle emergency situations.
Lastly, what are the biggest problems facing the health sector and how can they be resolved?
We are expected to rapidly respond to any outbreak and emergency situation, but since the context has changed we are no longer in the driving seat. Regarding hurdles, the biggest facing the health sector is lack of qualified human resources. We also do not have adequate financial and technical resources. We want the health system to be restructured so that there is better communication between federal, provincial and local governments. Also, the public health sector should not suffer because of lack of budget and there should be clear mechanisms to respond to outbreaks and mitigate risks of outbreak.

Putting an end to months-long stalemate, the ruling Nepal Communist Party today nominated standing committee member Agni Sapkota as candidate for the speaker of the House of Representatives.
A meeting of the NCP central secretariat held this evening in Baluwatar took a decision to this effect, NCP General Secretary Bishnu Paudel told mediapersons after the meeting.

Earlier in the morning, NCP co-chairs KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal had agreed to nominate Sapkota for the post. The post has remained vacant since Krishna Bahadur Mahara’s arrest in October on the charge of attempt to rape.
The delay in deciding on candidate for speaker on the part of the NCP has forced the HoR meeting to be postponed thrice this Bill Session that began on December 20. The next HoR meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow.
The delay was basically due to Dahal and Oli having different favourites for the post. While Oli was in favour of former speaker Subas Chandra Nembang, Dahal was under pressure from his former CPN-MC colleagues not to forego the speaker’s post they were allocated before they merged with the former CPN-UML to become the NCP.
NCP standing committee member Devendra Paudel said today’s decision was a result of realisation on the part of the two co-chairs that it was not ideal to hold the Parliament, and the country, hostage to their personal stands. “The party took the decision in line with the spirit of party unification,” he told THT.
With the latest decision, Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahangphe will now have to tender her resignation to pave the way for the election of speaker. As per the constitutional provision, speaker and deputy speaker cannot be from the same party and have to be of different genders.
Tumbahangphe, who has also staked her claim to the speaker’s post, has maintained she will resign once the party decides on a candidate for speaker. THT’s attempts to reach Tumbahangphe over phone on her next move failed.
If Tumbahangphe puts in her papers tomorrow, the senior-most lawmaker will preside over the HoR meeting, which will then announce a date for the election of both speaker and deputy speaker.
Parliament Secretariat Spokesperson Dasharath Dhamala said if tomorrow’s meeting announced a date for the election and political parties agreed on a fast-track process, filing of nominations and election could be completed by Tuesday. If not, filing of nominations could be done on Tuesday and election on Wednesday, added Dhamala. “This depends on how political parties want the process to proceed,” he said.
Since the NCP will now have to give up the deputy speaker’s post, the ruling party has to decide which candidate from which party to support. “The NCP will take a decision by holding consultations with other parties once the election process begins,” Nembang told THT.

POKHARA: As many as four Chinese tourists, who were reported missing from Manang after avalanche hit the trail route along the Annapurna trekking circuit, have come into contact with the Nepali authorities, on Sunday.
At least four Koreans — Leen Min Su, Jong Pil Bong, Kim Sook Ja, Choi Hyo Won — and three Nepalis –Wangdak Sherpa, Saroj Pariyar, Min Bahadur Tamang — are still reported missing after the avalanche triggered by heavy snowfall hit the trail route along the Annapurna trekking circuit on Friday.
According to Tek Gurung, an official at the Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP), four missing Chinese tourists were found near Muktinath Temple today.
Locals along with Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal (TAAN), Western Regional Association Pokhara, and Union of Trekking Travels Rafting Workers Nepal have been searching for the missing persons in the area.
Vijaya KC, President of Uni Travels Pvt Ltd, who returned after reaching the affected area said, “Search operation has been hampered by the snow.”

276,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-pipe-dream/,"It’s unfortunate that the political leadership just wants to put to rest Nepal’s transitional justice process
A five-member recommendation committee constituted to nominate office bearers for two transitional justice mechanisms – Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) – on Saturday recommended its names for the two panels. The Om Prakash Mishra-led panel was appointed on March 26, 2019, three weeks before the extended tenures of TRC and CIEDP officials ended in April 2019. Mishra and his team, which was given three-months’ timeline, failed to name names for months, due to protracted bickering between the ruling NCP and the main opposition, NC, over their preferred choices. That’s precisely why the panel took so long to compile its first list of 61 odd names.
Saturday’s development comes amidst rather obvious circumstances, and follows Friday’s meeting between the top leaders of the ruling and the main opposition. By the look of things, it’s not too hard to make out that the recommendation panel was told by the leaders to recommend ‘so and so’ to TRC and ‘so and so’ to CIEDP.  If the government approves their names, the new TRC shall be ld by one Ganesh Dutta Bhatta and the CIEDP by another, Yubaraj Subedi. Both TRC and CIEDP have been rudderless since April 14, 2019. But will that pacify the conflict victims? No. Suman Adhikari, founding Chair of the Conflict Victims’ Common Platform, has already criticised the nominations as farce. The panel, according to Adhikari, ignored suggestions from them. If the real stakeholders – in this particular case, the conflict victims – do not feel listened to, then what’s the point of appointing names in the mechanisms intended of addressing the grievances of those affected by the so-called People’s War? Will the two panels be able to give the conflict victims a fair deal, or will it give them a sense of justice in the long run? It doesn’t look like so because one of their key demands – only those with expertise on human rights issues – is not adhered to. It must be noted that the earlier commissions failed to perform the tasks assigned to them due mainly to two reasons: both the commissions lacked legal teeth and the office bearers did not have adequate expertise on human rights issues. As a result, the two bodies collected over 63,000 complaints but failed to fully investigate even a single case. And, the history is set to repeat, yet again.
It’s unfortunate that the political leadership and government of the day just wants to put to rest Nepal’s transitional justice process without following proper protocols in clear disregard of globally accepted norms and practices. Not giving a hoot to heal the wounds that tens of thousands of people have been living with for more than a decade since signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in November 2006 only undermines credibility of Nepal’s transitional justice process. The CPA seeks to end Nepal’s armed insurgency and the conflict between the Government and the erstwhile Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). But then it’s unfortunate that repeated calls from the international community and the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling ordering formation of transitional bodies consistent with the international norms and standards just remain a pipe dream.

Pay heed to weather 
Eleven tourists, including four Korean and four Chinese nationals, went missing on Friday morning when an avalanche struck them on a trekking route to the Annapuna Base Camp. They are said to be stranded between Hing Ku Cave and Deurali in Annapurna Rural Municipality. Police teams have been mobilised in search of their whereabouts. As many as 90 stranded tourists have, however, been rescued to safer places. But the bad weather with heavy snowfall has hampered further rescue.
This is not the first time that such a large number of tourists have been stranded or gone missing in the Annapurna Trekking Circuit, the most popular trekking route in the country. It may be recalled that as many as 39 tourists had died in October 2014 due to the heavy snowstorm that arose from the Cyclone Hudhud in the Bay of Bengal, making it the country’s worst trekking disaster. Those people could have avoided the disaster had they paid attention to the weather forecast issued by the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology. The concerned trekking agencies that organised the event for the foreigners should have alerted them about the weather before they ventured on the risky walk in the Himalayas.

Tourism is one of the most important engines of economic growth and development. As per the data published by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), the tourism industry now accounts for 10 percent of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) and employs 319 million people all over the world. The latter figure is expected to reach 421 million by 2029. This means that tourism is not only an economic growth engine, but also a growing employment engine in itself.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Tourism generates and employs a large workforce and does so in an inclusive manner providing great opportunities for both genders, even creating jobs for young people. It is estimated that worldwide and, on average, 55 per cent of employment in the tourism industry is women.
Considering its contribution over time, no country can be indifferent to tourism. Accordingly, many countries have done what they reasonably could to increase their share of investment in this industry, including strategies and campaigns to highlight the attractiveness of their preferred destinations to enjoy which visitors come from far away to this corner of the globe. One such campaign is the current Visit Nepal Year 2020. The stated objective of it is to bring in 2 million tourists with a targeted daily spending of USD 75. For this, international promotion and publicity campaigns are very important and essential but tourism is such a business that needs promotion both internally and internationally.
Internal tourism must be promoted because if local people don’t know what is tourism, who the tourists are, why and how they must be treated tourism isn’t likely to flourish. Likewise, if our tourism industry isn’t promoted overseas, it won’t help increase the number of tourists and the duration of their stay in our country. It is a fact that whatever importance we attach to tourism, especially international tourism, it is certainly not the main source of livelihood of many Nepalis and communities. Many people in Nepal are engaged in farming, raising livestock and only a few are engaged in tourism businesses.
The Nepali people have a unique relationship with nature and the local environment that can be observed from their everyday interactions with land and forest products for their firewood, building materials, fodder and trees.
Poor people care more about their survival than their welfare or recreational needs. Women and disadvantaged groups in particular who have been like proverbial frogs in the well and have rarely travelled outside their respective villages have no idea of who the tourists are and what to expect from them. What they normally do is to sell their surplus products at local bazaars and they have no idea how to approach the visitors. Many people in villages reckon that tourism is a big business not within their reach but run by rich and wealthy people of Kathmandu, Pokhara and a few other metropolitan cities only.
It is true that most businesses are capital intensive requiring a huge investment in order to get handsome returns. The average Nepalis can hardly afford to do so. Yet tourism is one such enterprise that can be run by investing not that much. This can be done by giving a warm welcome to the tourists in their own homes and by creating a homely atmosphere to both internal and international visitors. So it isn’t without reason that the government has brought in the concept of homestays that allows local communities to welcome tourists in their own homes provided they meet the specifications and guidelines set.
Learning from the experiences of Malaysia, South Korea and in consultations with tourism experts, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders, the government is actively seeking the promotion of this tourism product in Kathmandu, Kavre, Sankhuwasabha, Palpa, Chitwan and many other areas of Nepal. The main objective of this venture is to draw 40 per cent of tourists to the villages, let the locals themselves take the initiative to promote their own destinations and thereby reap the benefits from the tourism hospitality that has hitherto enjoyed by tourism entrepreneurs of the metropolitan cities and a network of international companies.
Homestays have the potential of enhancing employment, augmenting income of the local communities and thereby raising the standards of living at the local level.
One of the main reasons why tourism hasn’t been able to contribute as much to our local economy is an apathy shown by the political parties towards this sector except during these campaigns which are launched from time to time. Nepal launched Tourism Year 2011 with the slogan “Together for Tourism” which wasn’t the first of its kind as Year 1998 had also been declared as Visit Nepal Year and so was 2002/3 that was launched as ‘Destination Nepal’ campaign that was in addition to Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) campaign, “Naturally Nepal…Once isn’t enough” and government’s campaign, “Send home a friend and Nepal for all seasons”.
Thanks to our unmatched comparative advantage in nature-and culture-based tourism as well as friendliness and hospitality of the people, Nepal has been able to attract tourists even in years of crises like the decade-long conflict when tourists kept coming despite political upheaval and instability.
Nevertheless, it doesn’t mean that it isn’t necessary for political parties to adapt the industry over and over to meet the demands of the new times and consumers.

278,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/emerge-from-darkness-to-light/,"The philosopher, Plato, thought that we are all in the same yacht apropos of our vision. This, notwithstanding the fact that all of us aim to be better than others while imbibing and cultivating wisdom, valour, balance, or commitment, and not being absurd, anxious, indisciplined, or prejudiced. The inference is apparent — if we want to be really, also tangibly happy, we must ‘cherry-pick’ to live well and live well within.
The mediaeval alchemist-physician-philosopher Paracelsus, likewise, articulated the idea that each of us has a creative talent for the arts, sciences, and also philosophies. He suggested that our resourceful influences are not just peripheral, but also deep and profound. Put simply, this translates into our innate ability to produce thoughts and emotions by anything that is impelled in a particular, also non-specific,form. Paracelsus advocated that there were several undesirable thoughtful and emotional entities that triggerred energy logjams. The outcome is palpable — when we‘load’ ourselves with negative energies, on a persistent basis, it becomes challenging for us to functioning well. When this pattern becomes chronic, the predictable spin-offs are dreadful habits.
The more we understand that we are not captives, but owners of our thoughts, feelings, and emotions, the better we are anchored to our psyche. When this happens, we are in control of ourselves and our feelings. But, the moment we discard our ‘hold’ and leave it at that for prolonged periods, we get detached. The best thing to do to change, or transform, is to negate our sense of isolation and its inevitable by-product: negative emotional energy. We ought to understand that there is no better way to expelling negativity from our mind than focusing on the positives. This would, sooner than later, guide us to ‘reinvent’ oneself and also understand our body and soul.
There is yet another simile that could hold us in good stead —just think of your emotions as a petite paper boat, with a thread, in a puddle of water. The unpretentious ‘widget’ moves spontaneously, but just as much as you’d let it go around. This holds good, yet again, for your mind and emotions — that it is only when you break out of your comfort
zone and not get entrenched in the dizzy cocoon that was part of your erstwhile negative psyche, would you be able to surmount the skewed emotions of the past and emerge from darkness to light.

279,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-heed-the-call/,"The ways of the government are starting to become autocratic, and they are eroding the gains made after the 1990 uprising
The Oli government’s intimidating tactics to subdue freedom of expression through a series of laws and deny justice to the victims of the decade-long conflict under one pretext or the other might require a volte-face. The government did not yield as long as the Nepalis were protesting, but now that international rights bodies are starting to voice concern about attempts by the government to deny the people their hard-earned rights, it would be in its interest to heed the call. The New York-based Human Rights Watch in its World Report 2020, made public on Wednesday, has come down heavily on the government for its role to ‘stifle critical voices and protect those allegedly responsible for past war crimes’. The year 2019 was a critical year for journalists, who fought tooth and nail to keep Nepal’s press freedom as the government, basking in its near two-thirds majority, brought one restrictive bill after another in the Parliament. Three bills in particular affected the press negatively – namely the Media Council Bill, the Advertisement Regulation Bill that makes publishers accountable for the advertisement content, and the recently endorsed Information Technology Bill.
The IT bill was endorsed by the Parliamentary Development and Technology Committee with majority vote without holding wider consultations with the stakeholders and despite strong reservations from the opposition, the Nepali Congress. The bill proposes severe penalty for offence against the state, computer hacking and cyber bullying. But it is vague on what ‘cyber bullying’ and ‘offence against the state’ stand for, and the terms could be grossly misinterpreted by the authorities to stifle freedom of expression. As for the Media Council Bill, what it does is try to bring the press council further under government control, although it is in dire need of reform. The bill is aimed at silencing the media by slapping heavy fines on media outlets, editors and journalists if they are found ‘damaging someone’s reputation’. The free media in Nepal has never been establishment-friendly, often annoying it to the extent possible. Hence, the new bill’s provisions are aimed at punishing the press under the veil of regulating it. The Federation of Nepali Journalists has submitted a number of proposed amendments.
Press freedom apart, the denial of justice to the victims of the conflict-era abuses is also of concern to Human Rights Watch. The conflict victims have been demanding amendment to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act so as to give it more teeth to criminalise the serious abuses committed both by the state and the Maoist rebels and prevent any amnesty to the rights violators. The government should not be seen as trying to protect the perpetrators of rights violations. There are other injustices that the government needs to look into seriously, such as the growing cases of rape in the country, which have been pointed out in the report. The ways of the government are starting to become autocratic, and are starting to erode the gains that have been made on freedom of expression and human rights since the 1990 uprising, all under the façade of democracy. This does no one any good.

Attacks on FDI
Frequent attacks on the firms and projects having majority share of foreign direct investment (FDI) is a serious issue the government should not take lightly. The government’s attempts to attract more FDI in infrastructure development will erode if such deliberate attacks continue unabated. Most of the attacks on those firms are said to be carried out by the outlawed Netra Bikram Chand-led Communist Party of Nepal.
It is the duty of the government to provide adequate security to their investment, people working on the project sites and equipment. The attacks on Ncell towers and field offices of Upper Karnali and Arun III Hydropower Projects, both of which are being built with FDI, are clear instances that the government has done too little to curb such senseless acts. Persons involved in attacking the FDI investment should be dealt with strictly. At the same time, the local people and elected officials at the local levels should also cooperate with the government to discourage such acts from taking place, which  jeopardise the investment climate. The attacks on the FDI projects will not only put a damper on the FDI climate, but will also cause a huge loss to the projects under construction.

Ensuring a greater deal of financial literacy in Nepal requires the active engagement of three parties — regulatory agencies, Banking and Financial Institutions, and educational institutions
On observing the lifestyle of the villagers, they seem to have no financial plans. They spend money right away, with no vision for the future, and are in no mood to open a bank account. This vividly represents the poor level of financial planning on account of poor financial literacy.
Financially literate means consumers are able to make wise choices in using financial products, make sound financial decisions, and optimise resources through better financial planning.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
With sound financial literacy, individuals can eradicate financial distress in the future. It also means ensuring better financial discipline and making better use of scarce financial resources.
Studies indicate that financial literacy in Nepal is low. Only 45% of the adult population has a bank account, as per the World Bank report of 2017, which indicates a low level of financial literacy, though it could also be because of poor financial access.
Ensuring a greater deal of financial literacy in Nepal requires the active engagement of three parties – regulatory agencies, Banking and Financial Institutions, and educational institutions.
Nepal Rastra Bank, as a regulatory agency, has shown ample interest in promoting financial literacy. It has been organising financial literacy campaigns throughout the country. Similarly, it has been organising financial literacy programmes, celebrating International Money Week, implemented a Clean Note Policy, developed promotional materials relating to financial literacy, adopted stringent Client Protection measures and formulated a financial literacy national strategy.
Similarly, a directive issued by the central bank provides for financial literacy and financial consumer protection. It has instructed licensed entities to practise simplified and transparent banking practices and mandatorily organise financial literacy programmes.
Following the instructions by the bank, BFIs (banks and financial institutions) have been allocating some of their resources for financial literacy campaigns as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
Similarly, the regulator of the securities market in Nepal, SEBON, is also promoting financial literacy. Recently it took membership of OECD INFE (International Network of Financial Education), making it the first organisation from Nepal to forge such a partnership. It has also organised an international conference on Financial Consumer protection and financial education in coordination with the OECD.
Another regulatory body in the financial sector that looks after the insurance sector, Rastriya Beema Samiti (Insurance Board), also has financial (insurance) literacy in its agenda. Similarly, insurance companies licensed by the board have also been found organising insurance literacy programmes in the country as part of their CSR initiative.
However, the education sector has lagged behind in imparting basic financial knowledge to the students. It is important to include financial education in the syllabus of the educational institutions as knowledge and skills transferred at a young age will come handy throughout life.
As such, students have little knowledge about general banking skills. They are not taught about saving, investment or entrepreneurship. They don’t have proper knowledge of what the BFIs do. Even though commercial banks have reached almost every local level, people prefer to keep money at home. When the salary gets credited into their account, they rush to the banks the very next day and take out all the money to the last paisa.
The onus lies on the educational institutions to impart financial knowledge to the students. A coordinated approach must be taken by the central bank, Ministry of Education and educational institutions to develop a financial literacy curriculum so that students are not shut out from another life-saving skill. For the time-being educational institutions can launch financial literacy programmes themselves, or take the help of the BFIs, which are now present in almost all the local levels. Such initiatives should also be a priority of the local level Gaupalikas and Nagarpalikas. Local-level bodies can inculcate financial literacy not only to the school level students but also to every household by setting up various groups.
Financial literacy is a must for society’s upliftment. The government has made financial literacy and financial inclusion a priority. In addition to bank branches, it has also given priority to use of alternative channels to increase financial access. Likewise, use of IT-based channels like mobile banking, internet banking and branchless banking has been gaining popularity in Nepal. All these reveal an increase in financial service access to the customers.
However, supply requires a demand for service delivery to be effective. Stakeholders should consider imparting financial literacy to the targeted customers to ensure that the customers receive the services well. This not only ensures financial well-being of the customers but also ensures market expansion, capital formation and proper use of scarce resources, while strengthening the economic sector and stability. All these help in the sustainable growth of the economy.

281,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-ad-hoc-plan-2/,"The idea of setting up industrial villages at the local levels should be carried out only after a well-thought-out plan of action
The concept of establishing industrial villages at the local levels is not a bad idea in itself as long as it helps to lift the farmers – major suppliers of raw materials – out of poverty and increase their income. Majority of the people in the rural areas still depend on agriculture and forest resources for their livelihood. But their contribution to the national economy is less than 30 per cent. This trend has continued unchanged for decades despite the government’s repeated emphasis on modernising the country’s agriculture sector with financial and technical inputs. Why has the agriculture sector not grown at the desired level? A simple answer to this question is, it has not been linked with industries that produce finished products to be sold in the domestic and international markets. Every time a new minister takes charge of the Ministry of Industry, s/he comes up with a grandiose plan of linking agriculture with industries. But it is never translated into action, largely because of lack of a national level policy that could help drive the agricultural sector towards modernisation. Modernisation of agriculture and forest-based resources is next to impossible without connecting them with an industrial base.
Newly-appointed Industry Minister Lekhraj Bhatta on Tuesday announced that his ministry would set up industrial villages in 32 local levels across the country. The ministry will release Rs 9.2 million within 15 days to construct the necessary infrastructure. His announcement has come at a time when the much-hyped Bhairahawa-based Special Economic Zone has largely remained dysfunctional for want of international markets for the goods that would be produced there. Other industrial estates to be set up in each of the seven provinces have also not kick-started. As per the plan, the aim of setting up the industrial villages is to increase investment in small and medium-sized enterprises by mobilising local resources, raw materials, technology and skills.
This concept will not yield any desired results as long as the farmers do not get a fair price for their produce. Agro- and forestry-based industries have huge potential in the country. These industries not only help create jobs at the local levels but also help increase the income of the locals, who depend on agriculture. The government should promote agro- and forest-based industries by coming up with a national policy. Turmeric, ginger, cardamom, coffee, herbal products, dairy farm, sugarcane, low-volume, high value crops and timber industry are some of the major sectors where Nepal could have a competitive edge over other goods. But not even the domestic investors, let alone foreign ones, have come forward to setting up big agro-based industries. South Korea became an industrialised nation within decades because it stressed on small and village-based industries relying on agriculture. But working on an ad hoc basis, which we have been seeing for decades, will not produce any expected results. The idea of setting up the industrial villages should be carried out only after a well-thought out plan of action. The government first needs to analyse the available data to ascertain why small-scale industries in the country have failed to sustain.

Community schools
It’s no surprise that community schools are losing students to private schools where English is the medium of instruction, as is the case with such schools in Tanahun district. Private schools are making inroads even in small towns across the country, and parents are willing to spend some money if their wards will get a better education. The community schools would not have had such a poor image if the headmaster and the teachers were made accountable for what they teach. Instead, most teachers are party cadres, and are there to pocket the not-so-bad salary and perks doled out by the government.
Parents, however, might be unaware that a private school advertising as English-medium doesn’t necessarily mean it will provide a good education. If it’s hard to come across good teachers even in the capital, one can well imagine the situation in the small towns. In some districts in recent times, students have been leaving private schools and opting for community schools as the latter have improved greatly. Using English as the language of instruction and introducing technical education, among others, will add charm to the community schools that are affordable to all.

282,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/dont-burn-the-stubble-upcycle-or-recycle-crop-residue/,"Relying heavily on just one or two crops has always been a terrible idea. India’s granary, Punjab, resorted to rice-wheat rotation after displacing other traditional crops, including barley and pulses, more suited to the region
A lot of noise is made throughout India, from Punjab and Haryana to Delhi, during the paddy harvesting season. Stubble burning isn’t an act of ignorance or illiteracy but of rebellion and helplessness. Rebellion towards government lethargy and helplessness, because farmers are threatened by increasing economic marginality and eventual extinction. According to the Economic Survey of India 2018, the incomes of Indian farmers have been stagnant since the last three years, bringing some kind of a morbid sense into the statistics of 45 farmers committing suicide every day in India. Machines are unaffordable, and there isn’t any facility to dump crop residues.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
During the National Conference on Agriculture for Kharif Campaign in 2017, crop residue management alternatives to prevent stubble burning were discussed and debated. From retention of crop residue as mulch to government’s responsibility by giving reasonable subsidy on equipment, everything was expected to be sorted out. Still, the ‘burning issue’ seems to be on the back burner even while humans choke. Adapting to the changing needs of the society, which is nothing but embracing farming techniques with a touch of humanity, will end slash and burn. Farmers reeling under debts, penury and poverty will opt for easy and quick ways to clear their fields. With facts and statistics at our disposal, farm fires can be blamed for 40 per cent of the total pollution in New Delhi. Still, it can’t be ignored at least twice a year, just as we can’t turn a blind eye to a governance deficit.
Multi-pronged strategies devised two years back at the conclusion of the two-day national conference to double farmers’ incomes by 2022 and the eight groups that were formed to discuss in-depth on the best mechanisation practices to avoid burning of straw in addition to market reforms and many more haven’t lighted any lamp at the end of any tunnel.
It all goes back to the green revolution of 1965 that introduced high yield varieties of rice and wheat with unintended ecological and socio-economic repercussions. Yes, Punjab’s ‘story’ of prosperity in disguise once began with the green revolution and government incentives and subsidies. An undisputed fact is nature abhors monoculture. The practice of relying heavily on just one or two crops has always been a terrible idea. The granary of India resorted to rice-wheat rotation after displacing other traditional crops, including barley and pulses, more suited to the region. Is the miracle of the green revolution still making sense? The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in Ludhiana that has emerged as a centre of excellence in agriculture research can always pitch in with their expertise to find feasible alternatives to stubble burning and convince the farmers and the government too if need be. It’s through that diversity that we can sequester carbon [and] put that carbon into the soil. That carbon, in turn, through the soil biology, is what produces healthy crops, healthy animals, and eventually healthy people.
Unfortunately, today, stubble burning alone doesn’t plague this land. Dry/contaminated dug wells, intermittent supply from tube wells, reduced storage capacity in water reservoirs and depleted ground water looms over the farmers as the smog over the Indian capital. Stubble burning is also a reflection of the agrarian crisis hitting India’s granary.
Fool proof solutions offered by R&D institutes and entrepreneurs to handle wheat and paddy stubble are aplenty, ruling out the need for conferences, national and international and symposiums on crop residue management. Governments that encouraged mono-cropping and double cropping with all enthusiasm must ensure alignment between different ministries to end stubble burning, advocate and promote no-till farming practices with all possible resources instead of doles and fines, encourage industries that can use crop residue as raw material by incentivising them.
Timely intervention with judicious solutions during that short window between harvesting paddy and preparing the field for sowing the successive wheat crop will pave way for pollution-free states.
The country is swift and prompt when it comes to building statues or launching satellites or procuring arms or modernising the nuclear arsenal. It’s a pity that governments are helpless when it comes to helping poor farmers. We can take enough lessons on crop residue management from the Philippines and countries where paddy cultivation is done extensively.
Massive institutional support by the state, including assured price and marketing support, addressed the food security needs since the green revolution in Punjab. What’s preventing the same institution from helping farmers to stop stubble burning? Composting crop residue or maize as an alternative to paddy or no-till farming or making a happy/superseeder affordable are all possible feasible solutions with an effective vigilant monitoring network. Citizens can wish, pray and hope the government think-tanks will come up with a clear, level-headed permanent solution to this perennial problem. What is most urgent is to eliminate those cartels of middlemen and agents thriving in markets established under the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act-1963. Overall growth objectives should never clash with sustainability concerns and never with human welfare.

283,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/lean-concept-and-its-application/,"Lean is a method that grew out of the Toyota Production System in the middle of the 20th century to create a more effective and efficient business by motivating and engaging the workforce to eliminate wasteful practices. In general, it helps business to increase overall profitability and customer satisfaction by reducing non value additions.
In today’s competitive world, we are forced to do more with fewer resources. One way in increasing effectiveness and efficiency is to adopt Lean Management techniques. All types of business can benefit from it. The manufacturing industry has been implementing the Lean approach for many years. This tool provides ways to help organisations identify and reduce waste in their processes and procedures and ultimately enhance their value.
There are eight categories of waste identified by the Lean method. They are: Transportation – transporting items or information not required to perform a process from one location to another. Inventory – An inventory or information that is being stored or not being processed due to overproduction. Motion – unnecessary motion of personnel, equipment or information due to inadequate workspace layout, missing parts or tools. Waiting – time waiting for parts, tools, supplies or the previous process step. Overproduction – producing more than what is required to meet current demand. Extra processing – activity that is not adding value or required to produce a functioning part, product or service.
Defects – Non-conforming products or services requiring resources to correct defects. Unutilised/unrecognised talent – Failure to effectively engage employees in the process and fully utilise their knowledge and skills
Lean principles are particularly useful for organisations and activities that work in a systematic way. Another important concept in Lean is ‘5S’, a system designed to improve efficiency through a systematic approach to organisation and cleanliness in the workplace. The system includes five fundamental guidelines – sort, set, shine, standardise and sustain.
The concept of Lean has already been adopted by most countries. I believe that greater understanding of the Lean principles can help an organisation reduce the cost by removing non-value adds rather than just cost-cutting, thereby delivering key insights productively by deviating from the traditional approach.

284,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-cycle-of-corruption/,"Corruption erodes the trust of the people in the govt, the parties and the service-providers, and, above all, it impedes development
You actually don’t need an anti-corruption body to tell the Nepalis that corruption is rife in Nepal. The 24,000 complaints of corruption that the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) handled in 2018-19, including 17,000 new ones, speak volumes about its pervasive nature in all sectors, and threatens to become the second nature of our leaders and public office holders. Corruption takes place in many forms, and in many cases, it might not be as simple as an act of greasing the palms of officials. What if it is carried out in the garb of a policy-level decision? Or what if government officials and corrupt office-bearers of NGOs and cooperatives collude to embezzle funds? In its 328-page report submitted to the President on Monday, the CIAA has sought jurisdiction to investigate improper acts of public office holders as well as private organisations, which has been denied under the new constitution. According to the CIAA, corruption and improper acts cannot be treated as separate issues, as scrutiny about a complaint of one could unfold a case of another.
There are many reasons why corruption is growing in Nepal. One could be the poor salary of government officials. So paying the government employees adequate salary might help curb corruption to a degree. But what is a decent salary when everyone is in the mood to send their children to the West for an education or spend lavishly on their weddings? The CIAA, however, sees the expensive election system to be the bigger reason behind the growing corruption in the country. According to the study carried out by the Election Observation Committee, Nepal in 2018, a first-past-the-post candidate spent an average Rs 10.1 million to contest the parliamentary election in 2017 while it was Rs 8.1 million for the provincial assembly election. Some candidates even spent as much as Rs 150 -250 million to enter the House of Representatives (HoR), although the Election Commission had capped the campaign expenditure for the FPtP at Rs 2.5 million for the HoR elections and Rs 1.5 for the provincial assembly polls. Despite the colossal sums of money being spent on the elections, the political parties keep no account of their income and expenditure. Neither do the business houses that fund the election campaign keep any record.
Unless there is transparency in the amount of donations made available to the political parties, it will never allow the country to get out of the vicious cycle of corruption. So as sought by the CIAA, all transfers of donations should be made through the banking channel. Corruption erodes the trust of the people in the government, the parties and the service-providers, and, above all, it impedes development. But, who cares? In discouraging corruption and improper acts of public office holders, the CIAA has a big role to play, and this calls for strengthening the body with competent, able commissioners highly committed to the cause. While its demand for more powers to effectively curb corruption might seem plausible, it, however, risks becoming too strong to be in a position to start meddling in government affairs.

Protect Khulla Manch
The Khulla Manch, located at the heart of Kathmandu, has lost its essence as it has been used as a bus park, temporary settlement, a parking lot for private vehicles and a place for piling construction materials for the last couple of years. Earlier, it used to be an iconic place for political rallies and mass meetings. Recently locals of the Kathmandu city are mounting pressure on the concerned authorities to vacate it so that they can use it for recreation and gathering. Joining hands with the locals, ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC)-28 declared last Saturday that he would not allow it to be used for parking vehicles from January 15.
It is a good move. But the KMC authorities, including Mayor Bidhya Sunder Shakya, are opposed to the ward chair’s ‘arbitrary decision,’ prompting a row between the two. The ward chair is adamant to implement his decision with support from the city police. An open space is essential in a big city like Kathmandu, where people can gather there for various purposes. It can also be used for erecting temporary shelters in times of an emergency as during the 2015 quake. So, it is the duty of the KMC to protect the Khulla Manch from illegal encroachment.

Now the pull model is favoured over the push model, where the consumer defines the requirements and the manufacturer makes the products accordingly
With the rapid expansion and adoption of technology, the nature and operations of most industries have changed significantly. With many companies adopting the latest technological developments like process automisation, digitalisation, cloud computing, big data analytics and Internet of Things, there have been changes in multiple areas. With these changes, the traditional way of running the business is no longer viable in this era.
Digitalisation and process automisation are rising rapidly in domestic industries, too. But the leadership style has remained very much the same. Leaders still follow the traditional hierarchical leadership system. They tend to make decisions and hand them over to the lower, operational level management who don’t understand why they should do what they should do even if what they should do might be wrong in the long run.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
For effective outcomes, you need to know “why?” than the “what?” When you’re given a task without being explained, you’re not motivated to exceed the expectations. As you’re not motivated, you will not be able to bring out the full potential in you. For the employees to be motivated, they need to have intrinsic job satisfaction, which doesn’t come from the salary but the job itself, a challenging job. Their input on decision-making and higher responsibility must be given to the employees to motivate them and take them to action.
Attracting digital talent is another challenge as Gen Z is different from the Gen Y and Gen X. They are attracted by factors other than those that motivated the Millennial and previous Gen. They want challenging jobs, their input in decision making and an organisation that isn’t hierarchy-based. They want flexibility, remote working, innovative ideas and creativity for even the simplest job. And if the leader follows the conventional style of leadership, Gen Z might leave the company because no one is compelled to stay in a single company till retirement. If they are not happy, they will use the company’s internet and computer to look for a job elsewhere.
The employees’ power has risen to the highest level in history, their ability to look for job vacancies and seek information about employers around the world has become convenient and transparent. Websites like LinkedIn and Glassdoor help search for jobs and recruit people. The latter even allowing people to see the employees’ review of the company, CEO rating, salary insights and more, which means ‘we have nothing to hide’ philosophy has become the norm.
Businesses need to consider another major stakeholder: customers, who keep the business alive. We must understand their needs and deliver the products or services they are looking for, or else they will switch to the competitors. While it has become easier to get to know the customers and engage with them through feedback, customer survey and review, businesses are yet to understand that they need to collaborate with the customers and provide the products or services that satisfy their needs for the sustainability of the business.
Understanding the impacts of digital disruption allows an organisation to take more informed decisions, which can be explained with C’s. As automisation and use of digital technology allow for a virtual organisation like Fintech, which has been gaining popularity in the Western market, such an organisation is able to reduce its cost base significantly. And compared to traditional counterparts, it is able to reach the customers more conveniently. The product or service can also be of high calibre because of insight knowledge of customers and other stakeholders. The product/service can be more consistent, and technology allows one to have better communication, which allows better coordination and collaboration. So when we understand these, we know we have a competitive advantage over our competitors.
The marketing models should change from being product-centric to market-oriented. Traditionally companies used to manufacture their products and send them to the wholesaler, who sent it to the retailer and then to the consumer. Now pull model is favoured over the push model, where the consumer defines the requirements and the manufacturer makes the products accordingly. Dell, for instance, has already started making customised personal computers.
Competitors are major stakeholders we need to beware of, as traditionally competition used to be with the domestic competitors, but technology has made it possible for companies to become boundaryless. Microsoft, for instance, is no longer considered an American company, as it serves customers around the world. So domestic competitors must be on their guard against multinational companies while developing their strategy. The success of your company largely depends upon the type of competitors present in the market you operate. Because competitors keep bringing innovative products/services, your company should consider their objectives, strategy, resources and competencies to gain competitive edge.
So it is recommended that a leader adapt a leadership style that focusses on employees’ empowerment and their input. They give customers the power to have their say while providing customised products and service experience.

Everything came to a standstill. I knew I had to let you go.
No matter how much we know what is forthcoming, we can never be fully prepared for it. At the very moment, its intensity never fails to hit us right in the feels with its precision.
I knew this was coming for us, but that winter night, gulping back the tears as I lay down covered in blankets, the ache of saudade clutched me. I hated adversity for making me incapable to say to you, “Don’t go.” I was angry, I was sad …I wanted to cry and I wanted to be mad at you. But I couldn’t.
Deep in my heart, I know it was not easy for you, too. During our past few conversations, I could sense the struggle. The distance was tearing you apart. You wanted to be with me but my reluctance in sharing and holding back numerous things from you was starting to bother you. I could feel the anguish in your voice. Moreover, knowing that I was the reason for your pain was hurting me. It would be very selfish of me to put you through the misery when the reasons were from my end. I pushed you away many times, and now I deserve this distance.
I am waiting for the day I will meet you. My stubbornness will not let you believe, but trust me, I miss you. You are instantly the first thought in my every happy and sad moment.  I desire each day to be with you – yearning for a glimpse of you. I miss getting everyday doses of your intellect and humour. I close my eyes, and memories of us come rushing back, overwhelming me. I replay our conversations in my mind. However, there are words without your sound. I crave to listen to the sound of your voice. In many desperate moments, I resist the urge to dial your number to avoid things to get unpleasant.
I cannot wait for us to be a part of my everyday routine again. What a miserable stretch of time it is! I am waiting with bated breath to hear your heartwarming ‘Hello’ after those excruciating words. Now, I am ever more thankful for that moment as this absence only makes me realise how much more I want to be with you. I cannot wait to be tugged in your arms. Be ready for our meeting because there is so much I want to share with you and, above all, get an eyeful of you as you sip your sugar-free black coffee.

It is especially challenging to get a taxi outside the Ring Road in times of an emergency and during the odd hours. The government and the traffic police know very well that the cabbies quite often charge additional money or fleece the passengers under one pretext of the other. But the legal action taken for fleecing the passengers is too little compared to the amount they charge from the taxi users. They can easily recoup their loss as a result of the fine by charging more from another passenger. According to the rules, the offender is fined a certain amount of money every time he deceives the passenger. Such a fine never deters the taxi driver from cheating another passenger.
The Metropolitan Traffic Police Division has claimed to have taken action against as many as 4,891 errant cabbies in the past six months for refusing to turn on the fare meter, as per the complaints made by the general public. It seems that the Traffic Police have taken more action against the rule breakers (4,298) this fiscal than in the previous fiscal. But the actions have not served as a deterrent as the number of offenders is still on the rise. A snap survey carried out by this daily on Sunday found that only one taxi driver agreed to provide service with his meter on. Even if they agree to provide the essential service to the public on the meter, they often demand an additional Rs 150 or Rs 200.
After all measures to make the cabbies comply with the rules failed, the Traffic Police launched a ‘how much operation’ since 2015, and booked a total of 42,719 cabbies on the same charges. Records show that one taxi driver was fined at least 3.8 times on average in the last five years. However, the problem is that the Traffic Police cannot impose an additional fine for repeated offences other than what has been fixed by the rules. There must be a change in the rules if we are to have the cabbies abide by the rules. There must be a digital record-keeping system within the Traffic Police to keep track of those cabbies who tend to commit such offences more than once. This system, if well-implemented, should make them wary about committing the same offence time and again. At the same time, while it is imperative to adjust the taxi fare as per the inflation rate and rising cost of spare parts, the municipalities in the Valley also need to improve service delivery of the public transport system too so that the general public does not have to rely on the cabbies. Public transport must operate round-the-clock in every nook and corner of the urban centres. The Traffic Police can also learn lessons from other countries where the cabbies provide their service without fleecing the passengers.

Name the remaining
Province 3 is the latest among the country’s seven provinces to decide on a name and its headquarters. The Provincial Assembly, with a two-thirds majority, on Sunday decided to call it Bagmati and designate Hetauda as its headquarters. Earlier, provinces 4, 6 and 7 had confirmed their names and capitals. As such, there are only three provinces now without a name and a capital, namely provinces 1, 2 and 5. Despite reservations by and pressure from some groups, none of the provinces have been named on ethnic lines. Actually before the new constitution was written in 2015, there was a clamour for many more provinces based on ethnicity that made up the majority.
It would be prudent on the remaining provinces that still have not christened them to do so at the earliest. It’s been years since the constitution was launched, and is not understandable why it should take so long to name the provinces and agree on the headquarters. A capital demands many things, and inability to designate it stalls the development of basic infrastructure and other projects. Even though the provincial governments have money, they are unable to spend it in the midst of confusion about where the capital will be.

A general and a layman’s understanding of the term ‘test’ is that students take it and teachers give it, with the former deemed as having understood the taught concepts after managing to pass the test. More often than not, it is the test takers’ fault if he/she fails the test. On the other hand, it is the examinees again who get the credit, sometimes even undue, for what might be called ‘passing with flying colours’.
The test papers and items, by and large, do not get much scrutiny.  However, the effectiveness of the test in actually measuring what it purports to measure is also of paramount importance to pedagogy with poorly devised tests giving a false picture of the student’s true caliber. Teachers, who also double as test constructors, can greatly contribute to increasing the quality of tests they give by adopting a few tested and proven measures in the pedagogical field.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
In the context of Nepal’s schools, standardised final level examinations are given at the end of the basic level in grade 8, and in grades 10, 11 and 12 at the secondary level. The curriculum has been revised recently, and many in the field hope that it will address the problem of 10th grade pass-outs as the high school level course was found to be too difficult in the past.
Thus the need to improve the quality of tests and the corresponding curriculum to bridge this gap was always there.
This is called ‘predictive validity’, which is a degree to which a test can predict candidates’ future performance. This much-needed change in the quality of such standardised test papers is cardinal to school teachers as they are the ones who prepare the students for such tests. However, since test construction here is out of their jurisdiction, they can only hope that such a need is felt by people concerned at the macro level as well. In the meantime, what they can indeed do is try and make the quality of their internal tests better.
Rote learning by students and teachers’ teaching students formulaic responses to oft repeated questions have become a general feature in grades 8 and 10, for the purposes of the Basic Education Examinations (BEE) and Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) respectively. If one were to adjudge the quality of these question papers against the designated test specification, there are hardly any discrepancies; the test is slavishly faithful to the specification.
However, the specification itself leaves a lot to be desired as it is a disproportionate mix of predominantly knowledge level, or fact recall, questions. This might be the reason why the teachers then simply resort to ‘teach to the test’ tactics. Why bother about challenging the students with a higher order of thinking if ultimately it is only the ‘who’ ‘what’ ‘where’ questions or the mechanical ability of sentence-type transformation that matters? Such, unfortunately, is the test impact of teaching and learning in the classroom, which is also known as the ‘washback’ or ‘backwash’ of testing.
Against this backdrop, this writer believes, the quality of internal tests becomes particularly important. If constructing tests at variegated knowledge and skill levels is felt to be too risky and superfluous by teachers at these levels, they can still be done at other levels.
Anything that is out of the ordinary or the norm requires some extra bit of work. Teachers at the outset need to start by designing the test specification in line with the intended objectives of the course.
However, for reasons of convenience, what the teachers usually do is make slight adjustments to past question papers or randomly select questions from the chapters which they have covered.
Test specification serves as a blueprint for teachers both in terms of preparing the students for the test, having a proper understanding of what they need to learn as well as the
eventual construction of test papers. A good test specification considers many important factors like setting out clear objectives, timing, format, rubric for students as well as marking scheme for the examiners. It also needs to make sure that the content it stipulates for the test has diversity in the objectives with respect to addressing the various cognitive levels in students.
Bloom’s taxonomy, proposed by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom in 1956, is often referred to for this purpose of ensuring richness and diversity. It is simply a classification of different objectives by educators at different levels of learning: remembering, understanding, applying, analysing, evaluating and creating. Apart from the first two objectives, the latter four, which actually help develop critical thinking in students, often get overlooked.
The advantage of making them a mandatory component of the specification table is that it surely results in the setting of the corresponding questions. The other and, perhaps, more significant outcome would be in classroom learning itself as addressing those objectives would require teachers to plan classroom activities in line with them.
Teachers, for well justified reasons, put the blame on the irrelevancy of the curriculum for not being able to deliver well. Granted, the curriculum leaves a lot to be desired, but within that curriculum itself, they still can go that extra-mile and do what is under their control. Thinking about improving the quality of our tests could be one way to start.

289,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/bread-and-butter/,"I didn’t know for a long time as to what my boss meant by bread and butter. He would often thunder at me: “This is my bread and butter.” I would take it literally and would think to myself as he signed off tens of letters that this guy must be a real glutton to think of bread and butter all the time. His business was booming. Why is this man always mentioning bread and butter instead of fish and chips or rumali roti and Muglai chicken?
There was no way I could ask him what he meant by it as he was no less than a corporate Genghis Khan. So one day I went to a live Wikipedia, IJ, known only by the initials, an elderly colleague who was wont to burst of laughter with his whole body grinding the creaky chair. I asked him matter-of-factly so as not to give away my ignorance. I told him Genghis seems hungry all the time. He swayed in his chair with loud laughter. I tried to glean the answer without him suspecting: “Does Genghis eat bread and butter all the time?”
“No, no, he does not eat bread and butter but dal and roti. He is a Punjabi. But this company is his bread and butter. If this company closes, he has no bread and butter in Nepal,” he said. “It is also our bread and butter,” I countered. I got my answer. In order not to cut off the conversation abruptly, I asked him what he ate before coming to work. He said with a twinkle in his old eyes: “Dal-bhat.” Curious if everyone ate dal-bhat for breakfast, I asked another colleague, a steno-typist, what he ate in the morning. He said he did not eat anything but a cup of tea with bread. Always dressed in suit and tie, unusual for a steno, he would tell me stories about his previous boss, owner of a travel company in Basantapur, who paid so low that the steno could not even afford bread.
He said, before he quit, he pleaded for the last time for a raise, and the owner asked him about his breakfast. When he told him that he could not afford more than a loaf of bread, the owner thundered that that was the problem with Nepali youngsters. They want to ape foreigners. He told the steno to forget about a raise and advised him not to waste money on bread but to start eating chiura, which will keep him full for the whole day.
Whenever my boss was happy with my work, he would ask me if I had my bread and butter. I would shake my head vigorously, hoping to please him for a raise. The meaning of bread and butter had become more than a humble meal.

290,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-let-the-house-meet/,"At this point, why Oli and Dahal want their respective candidates – and not Shiva Maya – to become the Speaker is simply beyond any reasoning
When the Bill Session of Parliament kicked off on December 20, we all thought the House of Representatives, in which the ruling Nepal Communist Party controls a near two-thirds majority, would get down to business from day one. But that was not to be. The House meeting, postponed twice in as many weeks, has been put off yet again. The meeting of the House of Representatives, scheduled for Sunday, January 12, has been deferred, for the third time, after Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahangpherefused orders from the party high command to step down. The ruling Nepal Communist Party’s two co-chairs – Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal – had on Friday instructed Tumbahangphe to clear the way for the party to field its candidate for the Speaker’s post, vacant since the arrest of Krishna Bahadur Mahara in October on the charge of attempt to rape.The NCP leadership appears determined to secure the post of House Speaker but then the two co-chairs are at odds over who should the party’s candidate for Speaker be. Prime Minister Oli favours his close aide and former speaker Subas Chandra Nembang while Dahal has firmly put his weight behind his own confidant Agni Sapkota.At this point, why Oli and Dahal want their respective candidates – and not Shiva Maya – to become the Speaker is simply beyond any reasoning. On the other hand, Shiva Maya has publicly maintained that she is competent for the job and that she should be the next Speaker.
The NCP became the largest party in Nepal following the merger of two left parties – the CPN (Maoist) and CPN (UML) – after the parliamentary elections in 2017. But the merger has not prevented the leaders of the erstwhile parties from promoting their respective confidants to get an upper hand in the party. Since Mahara was a Maoist candidate, Dahal has been insisting that the new candidate should also be of his pick. Tumbahangphe, however, belonged to the former CPN-UML.The House has both the mandate and the power to appoint a new speaker at the earliest possible should the post fall vacant by following the due procedures. Unfortunately, the House has not been allowed to discharge its responsibility because the Parliament has come under the shadow of the executive. This, as noted by constitutional experts, is a betrayal of the constitution. At the heart of the Westminster system that the country has adopted lies the concept of separation of powers between the three branches of government – the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. Allowing the executive to influence the legislature doesn’t auger well for the proper functioning of both the constitution and the political system. By deferring the House meeting time and again, the ruling party is making a mockery of the Parliament. When the House is deferred it bars the people’s elected representatives from airing their views on issues of local and national importance. The ruling party cannot hold the House hostage at a time when there are about 40 bills to be discussed and passed into law, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact that awaits parliamentary approval.

Take strong action
The police have arrested proprietor of crusher industry, Bipin Mahato, the tipper’s loader Jitendra Mahato and tipper driver Munindra Mahato on charges of intentionally killing Dilip Mahato, 24, on the banks of the Aurahikhola of Shreepur in Mithila Municipality-5, Dhanusha. Dilip was killed Friday morning while trying to stop unauthorised excavation of sand from the river. Dilip had been protesting the illegal mining of sand for long. The industry proprietor had threatened Dilip’s father that his son would be crushed under a tipper if he continued to protest.
The arrested have confessed that the boy was first struck with a rod on his head and killed. After his death, the proprietor tried to make it look like an accident. While the police investigate the incident and present the accused before the court of law with full details, the local levels should take strong action against those involved in illegal sand mining. It was most inhumane on the part of the tipper driver and the proprietor to kill a person for opposing their illegal activity. At the same time, no political party should try to protect the culprits who have taken the life of a young man who wanted to do good for society.

Evergreening of loans and evergreen loans are two different concepts. Evergreen loans, also known as revolving loans, are those which can be used, paid back and used again once the loan is reviewed or the renewal criteria is met. However, here we will be discussing about the evergreening of the facility, which is an intentional manoeuvre by banks and financial institutions (BFIs) to mask loan default, probable default by disbursing new loans to help delinquent borrowers pay back their old and due loans or interest. It is malpractice whereby the BFIs extend more loans to highly leveraged firms and clients to help them repay those pending accounts and, in turn, receive lavish returns.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
In a recent inspection made at an institution, a reputed businessman was found to have withdrawn a handsome loan from a bank to settle a bad loan of his near and dear one in another development bank. Such practices are widespread in the Nepali banking industry. Though it is necessary to reduce the level of bad loans genuinely through the efforts of the BFIs, this will instigate a devastating economic implication if such effort to enervate the bad loans germinates from evergreening.
Loan evergreening is not a child of a single uterus. It might sprout out of multiple outlets. With regard to the severity of impact and complexity of nexus identification, evergreening in the Nepali financial market, apart from the methods discussed above, can be categorised into four major levels. First, settlement of one demand loan, or a similar natured loan, within a bank by disbursing the next demand loan deal. This is easy to identify and has feeble impact on the economy as BFIs allege that the deals are settled with new ones within the legitimate limits prescribed to the client. Second, non-revolving credit of a delinquent account within a bank is settled with one-off loan or ad hoc deals out of the regular DP (drawing power) limits.
Third, a delinquent borrower within a bank is served with another borrower within a bank with fresh disbursement to the second party. This is usually done at the end of the year or quarter, especially to a renowned counterparty or businessman to mask their faulty account and reduce the NPAs (non-performing assets). Fourth, the well-off person or business firm, or fair performing account, gets a regular fund within the limit or exceeding the limit to drag the fund to multiple institutions to settle problematic or due accounts on ground of personal or business relationship. The degree of complexity in terms of nexus and severity of impact of the four classes of evergreening gradually rises as we climb up the pyramid.
As per the provision of Directives (16) issued by Nepal Rastra Bank to the BFIs, A class BFIs can collect unlimited funds, resources, borrowings, debentures while it is 20 times the core capital for B class BFIs. Till date, the amount of resources in the financial institutions (A, B,C class BFIs) sums up to Rs. 3,800 billion, which is almost 2.5 times as large as Nepal’s budget or greater than the GDP of the country collected from diverse group of depositors. We can envisage the implication of this huge sum of money if it is channeled to unproductive, purpose-less and unregulated activities.
There are many instances where NRB has granted sufficient ground of pacifiers, such as interest capitalization during the moratorium period of priority sectors, loans for earthquake-stricken people based on collective guarantee and interest subsidy for commercial agriculture and livestock financing.
Evergreening is a serious act yet covert issue that is difficult for the regulators and also BFIs to exactly demarcate. But, for sure, its economic impact is like a slow poison to the economy as it disturbs the economic value of democracy while serving as a tool for money laundering. The spillover effect of a faulty financial sector over the real sector has manifold impact.
Regulators and other enforcing agencies have used the Banking Offences and Punishment Act 2064, mandatory provision of multiple banking, consortium financing agreement and CIC (Credit Information Company) reporting mechanism to enervate the evergreening practices in the banking industry, but the implementation and operational mechanism to complement the policy reforms is lacking.
A red code system to track evergreening, in coordination with the NCHL (Nepal Clearing House Limited) and other concerned law enforcing agencies, should be devised to address the issue. The unique code for large and frequent borrowers (amount can be fixed during policy making process) to monitor the disbursed fund at the source would enable data dumping from a master database to ascertain if evergreening has  actually been made.
The pyramid structure monitoring mechanism to see if more than 30 per cent value of the fund has been transferred out of a loan account without any business relationship, concomitantly identifying the source of the origin, is appropriate, and this should be linked up to the red code to make it easier to validate if the repayment has come from legitimate personal income, justifiable business proceeds or through the sale of personal equity, else it is evergreened.

292,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/general-practitioners-transforming-rural-healthcare/,"Khadaga Bahadur Giri, 50, from Dolakha, suffered an injury on the right leg, requiring surgery. But he could not go to Kathmandu for financial reasons, a representative example of people living in rural Nepal.
Under-resourced and poorly managed health systems in countries like Nepal pose challenges in achieving universal health coverage. One big challenge is the lack of specialist doctors and nurses in a rural setting. An innovative strategy to overcome this would be to promote General Practitioners (GPs) through training to help them to provide the comprehensive care needed by our patients there.
GPs provide whole-person care, working in partnerships with patients, nurses, allied health professionals and specialist colleagues. A GP knows the limitations of his skills and experience and understands when and where to enlist the most appropriate help, support and advice from colleagues.
They have broad skills and knowledge base that allows them to synthesise the treatment plan for the whole person. Given the changing demography of our patients and their need for holistic care, more generalist care in the specialities is needed. A critical role is emerging for GPs to work with specialists in our hospitals to provide high-quality and sustainable patient care.
In Nepal, there are several organisations that are working to promote GPs and their skills. One of them is Nyaya Health Nepal, which works in Achham and Dolakha districts. But the healthcare system lacks so many things. One of them is orthopaedics services. These services are being provided in both districts through the training and guidance of orthopaedic surgeons. To promote such services in countries like Nepal, an INGO, SIGN Fracture Care International, has been providing surgical equipment to local organisations like Nyaya Health Nepal. Giri underwent the operation that he needed at Charikot, performed by an orthopaedic surgeon and GPs, for free.  Continuous training of GPs to impart more advanced skills is required to transform the way healthcare has been delivered to the poor and marginalised people. The ultimate aim should be to improve and transform the healthcare system in rural Nepal.
General Practitioners with limited surgical training can play a significant role in providing surgical services in rural Nepal. With additional training, these GPs can be critical in serving rural areas of Nepal.

293,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-use-energy-for-growth/,"As we have started generating enough energy, focus should be on using it in the productive sectors that will help achieve economic growth
With regular, uninterrupted supply of electricity, industries, businesses, service sector and households have been switching to clean energy in recent times by reducing their over dependence on imported fuels – diesel, petrol, cooking gas and kerosene. Industries, business houses and the service sector have reduced their stock of diesel by almost 50 per cent to operate their businesses, thanks to the uninterrupted supply of electricity. The saga of perennial load-shedding for more than 18 hours a day has now become a thing of the past as the state-owned Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) has started generating more energy and addressed the leakage in the distribution system. Domestic Independent Power Producers (IPPs) have also contributed a lot to remedy the energy crisis, giving a sign of hope that the country will march towards industrialisation through the use of abundant water resources available within the country.
According to the latest figures, growth in the sale of diesel, which is widely used by industries, shopping malls and hotels, has gone down in the last three years – from 24.4 per cent in the first four months of 2017-18 to 9.5 per cent in the same period of the fiscal 2018-19. The growth further slumped to 1.9 per cent in the first four months of the current fiscal. Overall, growth in the sale of fossil fuels has slumped to 4.1 per cent in the first four months of this fiscal compared to 10.7 per cent in the same period a year ago and 24.6 per cent in the same period two years ago. More households are also switching to electric heaters or inductions to cook food as the sale of LPG has dropped heavily in the first four months of this fiscal. Currently, the NEA is supplying 1,285-MW of power through its national grids while the total demand of power during peak hours stands at around 1,335-MW, still a shortfall of 50 MW. The NEA is still importing 540 MW of electricity from India during the dry season to meet its peak demand. At the end of this fiscal, the NEA, however, expects to add an additional 1,000-MW of energy to its grids, both from its own plants and IPPs.
Figures show Nepal has so far imported fossil fuels worth Rs 58.26 billion in the first four months of this fiscal as against Rs 68.91 billion during the same period last fiscal. It means Nepal has imported 15.5 per cent less fuel in the current fiscal, thanks to regular supply of electricity. This is a good sign. Nepal not only needs to export energy but also utilise the clean energy domestically by encouraging investors to invest more on industries, manufacturing and service sectors that help create job opportunities within the country. There can be economic growth even by not exporting goods; we can do so by cutting down on the import of fossil fuels, for which we spend a large chunk of hard-earned foreign currency annually. As energy is the backbone of economic growth and sustainable development, we need to link it with production, manufacturing goods and services. But for this, the NEA must work out a plan of upgrading its existing distribution system that has caused huge inconvenience to the consumers during the peak hours. Keeping the distribution system intact is as important as generating electricity.

Juvenile offending
The alarming increase in cases related to juvenile offending in the country is a matter of concern for both parents and the authorities. As many as 821 children below 18 years of age, including 23 girls, were sent to juvenile correction centres in the country in 2018-19, up from 380 the previous fiscal, an increase of 115 per cent, for crimes ranging from rape and murder to drug smuggling and theft. Delinquent acts like underage smoking and drinking and skipping school would not find children in correction centres in the country. If the trend is any indication, the number of cases of juvenile delinquency will only rise in the future.
There are many reasons why juvenile delinquency takes place. They include broken homes, financial difficulty, lack of ethical education, bullying and absence of conversation between the parents and children on issues that bother the latter. It is thus important that both the parents and teachers keep close watch of what the children are doing and provide mentoring on problems, including sexual curiosity, they may harbour as they start growing. Preventing juvenile offending will not only improve the quality of life of kids but also make the community safer.

Science has, for long, used empirical data to estimate how close a theory is to the truth. But, not all theories, however, can be evaluated in that manner — for a plethora of reasons. In areas, such as string theory, cosmology and evolutionary biology, for instance, arriving at how close a theory is to the truth is next to impossible.
On the contrary, most of us would be able to assess how beautiful a given object is because the features of the object are immediately apparent, or accessible. This is, in other words, a straightforward constituent required to scrutinise the given object with aesthetic judgment: one that delivers a conclusive ruling on its beauty. Not so simple, though. Because, such a descent would make, or compel, us to wonder whether we’d all use our aesthetic canvas at the proverbial drop of a thought: to ascertain how imminent a scientific theory is to the truth.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
It is not that all scientific revolution theories have had a surge of aesthetically innovative strokes. Most scientists, for instance, called several old and new theories — when first put forward — ‘ugly.’ Many astronomers, who were contemporaries, regarded Johannes Kepler’s theory of planetary motions as unattractive. Because, Kepler’s ‘blueprint’ portrayed planetary orbits as ellipses — not a combination of circles. Sir Isaac Newton’s theory of gravity was, likewise, disliked by many of his contemporaries as being aesthetically unacceptable — for postulating action at a distance.
In recent times, quantum electrodynamics was regarded as repulsive for relying on non-standard mathematical operations for re-normalisation. The list is endless. Yet, they all came gradually to be declared as aesthetically appealing. As the philosopher-scientist, Francis Bacon, exemplified, “There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.”
The credo holds good for health and medicine, too. The notion of aesthetic health, as Alexander Edmonds, a medical anthropologist, equates in his sublime essay, Beauty & Health: Anthropological Perspectives, is quite explicit in a practice, such as plastic surgery, although there are other examples where aesthetics and health are entwined. Beauty, he emphasises, is not often a static quality, but is revealed in motion: a smile, a toss of the head, displays of grace and agility.
Body modification practices, likewise, paint, cut and puncture the skin, crush, file, mould and even remove bones. Yet in addition to the art of decorating and sculpting the human form — many of which have a clear, aesthetic rationale — most societies have developed a vast range of art forms for movement, training and performance. He adds, “The body in motion — walking, dancing, loving, playing, competing, or fighting — is not only social but often beautiful. Here again though, health can exist in tension with beauty.”
This isn’t all — as medical researchers E. Materia and G. Baglioargue vis-à-vis the impression of truth that medicine refers, or relates to. Evidence-based medicine (EBM), they articulate, is rooted in scientific truth. To explain the meaning and also trace the evolution of scientific truth the duo studied the outlines of the history of scientific revolution and the parable of modernity, up to the arrival of pragmatism and hermeneutics — the philosophy and methodology of textual interpretation. It is from here, they add, the concept of truth becomes discomfiting just as the momentum leans towards the integration of different points of view. The fuzzy set theory, likewise, for the definition of disease, as well as the shift from disease to syndrome — which has operational relevance for geriatrics, a specialty that focuses on healthcare of the elderly — seems to, just as well, refer to a more complex perspective on knowledge, although it is not as well defined as nosology, or the study of disease, in use.
They explain, “Supporters of narrative medicine seek the truth in the interpretation of the patients’ stories, and take advantage of the medical humanities to find the truth in words, feelings and contact with patients. Hence, it is possible to mention the ‘parrhesia,’ or free speech, which is the frank communication espoused by Stoicism and Epicureanism, or high living, a technical and ethical quality, which allows one to care in the proper way, a true discourse for one’s own moral stance. Meanwhile, EBM and narrative medicine are converging towards a point at which medicine is considered practical knowledge.”
Put simply, most scientists espouse and distinguish certain objective properties of theories from the subjective sense of beauty in contemplating a theory. However, not all scientists agree as to what aesthetic properties a theory must possess to influence as ‘cute.’ Yet, notwithstanding everything, aesthetic, or appealing, one thing is apparent: they often acquiesce to beauty in theories that encompass simple mathematical equations, the splendour of truth and beauty of the universe, the symmetries of nature, the sublime exquisiteness of the DNA, or Alia Bhatt’s basic face, among others.
There hangs a tale and its on-going saga apropos of the definition of prettiness, or comeliness, as exemplified by John Keats’ famous precept, “A thing of beauty is a joy forever.”

Amidst all this, my friend who lives in a mixed community at Nagpur sent me a text message, expressing her panic-stricken state of mind.
The verdict and my friend’s consequent reaction pushed me 27 years back in memory lane, when in 1992, communal riots had devastated the city of Ayodhya. During those critical days, the town I lived in was Hindu-dominated, with only one Muslim family in our immediate neighbourhood. The conflict between some bigots had changed the relationship among the people of the two communities. Imran Chacha, who had been living with his family in the neighbourhood for the last thirty years, had become an alien over night. Ostracised and excommunicated, Chacha and his innocent family were dragging their days under some sort of unspoken fear. Most of the people made their resentment clear on the following festival of Id.
I can vividly recollect the tearful eyes of Farina Apa, the oldest daughter of Chacha, who fearfully landed at our place with a bowl of Sevian and some sweets to present us on the auspicious occasion. With a trembling voice, Farina extended the sweets to my mother, and broke down into a pool of tears. As my mother hugged the sobbing girl, she shared that many of the people in the locality had refused to accept their sweets and Id greetings. Intensely drowned into sobs, Farina anxiously asked my mother if she would do the same. Now the grasp of my mother’s embrace got tighter and consoling the girl, she reiterated the lines of Allama Iqbal “Mazhab nahīñ sikhātā aapas meñ bair rakhnā” (religion never advocates hostility).
Farina’s smile was back, but now my mother had turned furious. Taking Farina, she barged into the houses of all those people who had humiliated the girl. The otherwise reticent mother of mine unleashed her anger and also exhorted the people to suspend their apartheid move. Finally people realised their folly and apologised to Chacha.
Whenever communal harmony is disturbed, many innocents have to pay a heavy price for no fault of theirs. I hope people living in mixed communities not only croon the beautiful lines of Allama Iqbal, but also assimilate the hidden wisdom couched in the lines. Righty said, “If your religion requires you to hate someone, you need a new religion.”

296,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-clarify-position/,"Other countries could apply similar pressure on Nepal to have their nationals ‘deported’, which deprives Nepal of taking an independent call on the issue
The 122 Chinese nationals, who were arrested in raids carried out in the capital on December 23 for their alleged involvement in cyber and financial crimes, were deported back to their country Wednesday evening, but human rights activists are crying foul that this is nothing but roundabout extradition. Two chartered aircraft of China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines flew with the Chinese citizens after the Nepal government handed them over to Chinese government officials at the Tribhuvan International Airport. This is the biggest deportation of foreign nationals ever from Nepal. Since their arrest from seven private residences in different parts of the capital a fortnight ago, speculations were rife as to what would happen to them – whether they would be deported, extradited or made to face prison sentences in Nepal. The Chinese nationals would not have been arrested without a tip-off from the Chinese government. And China has not made any attempt to conceal the fact, with an official from China’s Foreign Ministry, at a press briefing in Beijing the following day, confirming the action was taken under mutual cooperation between the two countries.
The 122 Chinese were arrested on suspicion of using social media to swindle money from rich, single and divorced Chinese women, running an illegal online gambling racket, operating the Ponzi scheme and blackmailing Chinese by hacking private information from their phones and computers. The Chinese, most of whom are below the age of 40, are learnt to have come to Nepal from the Philippines, Cambodia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka after governments there started cracking down on them for engaging in cyber and financial crimes there and in China. During the raids in Kathmandu, police confiscated a large number of laptops and mobile phones from the posh apartments. However, the police were unable to convict them of any wrong-doing, and the Kathmandu DAO ordered their release on Sunday and slapped small fines on them for engaging in activities restricted by Nepal’s immigration laws – they did not hold valid travel documents or even passports at the time of arrest.
What fate awaits the 122 Chinese back home is hard to say, given that such rackets operating from both China and overseas are said to have stolen billions of yuans from the banks there by hacking into the banking system. Nepal and China have not signed an extradition treaty, following opposition from some quarters, but during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Nepal in October, the two sides did sign a Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters. So legally, in the absence of an extradition treaty, the handover of the Chinese nationals to Chinese officials is deportation, but practically, this is extradition, with the government acting at China’s behest. But the question arises, since the police could not prove they had committed a crime here, was it justifiable to send them back home as demanded by China? What this could lead to is, other countries could apply similar pressure on Nepal to have their nationals ‘deported’, which deprives Nepal of making an independent call on the issue.

Land bank
With the increasing number of youths migrating for overseas employment, most of the country’s arable land has remained fallow or uncultivated. Only women and elderly people are left behind at home with no one to till their land even for their subsistence. The land, especially in the Tarai region and urban areas, is being rapidly fragmented for housing purpose, and land in the hilly and mountainous regions lies barren for lack of an able workforce. This is the reason why the country has not been able to produce enough food to feed its population.
To address this problem, the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation is gearing up to set up a land bank. Under this plan, no land owner will be allowed to keep his/her land fallow for more than three years. If anyone is found not tilling their land as per the land use policy, they will be fined. This may be a good move to encourage farmers to fully utilise their farmland for agricultural purpose. But no one will be tempted to engage in it unless s/he sees a prospect to support the family. Unless the government comes up with a robust plan of modernising the agriculture sector, the concept of the land bank will also gather dust on the shelf.

297,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/scrap-cidp-a-drain-on-taxpayers-money/,"It is argued that there is gross misuse of the CIDP fund because none but the lawmakers basically decide how, where and when to use it to warm their own pockets and those of their cadets
Recently, a writ was filed at the Supreme Court to annul the Constituency Infrastructure Development Programme (CIDP), also known as the Infrastructure Development Partnership Programme (LIDPP), or the ‘pork barrel fund.’ Under this programme, the lawmakers of the House of Representatives and the Provincial Assemblies, elected under the first-past-the-post electoral system, get government funds for the development of infrastructure facilities in their constituencies.
In the writ petition, it is argued that the CIDP is a violation of the constitution, and it holds no rationale as the provincial and local governments have been mandated to perform all such activities that the lawmakers have been doing under the CIDP. It is also argued that there is gross misuse of the CIDP fund because none but the lawmakers basically decide how, where and when to use it to warm their own pockets and those of their cadets. Only in exceptional cases do the lawmakers use the funds in the larger interest of the people.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
In the present federal system, the federal government is expected to work as a facilitator, while the provincial and the local governments are the main agencies for implementing the development projects. Therefore, criticism against the CIDP intensified after the promulgation of the new federal constitution in 2015 and the formation of three tiers of government in 2017-18.
It was in 1994 that the then Finance Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari introduced the CIDP with the sole objective of pleasing the then lawmakers in the country. The Public Procurement Act allows lawmakers to implement projects up to Rs 10 million through the consumer committees without any competitive process. This empowers the lawmakers to easily form such committees of their own people to misuse the funds. To appease the voters, the lawmakers often tend to allocate the CIDP funds on small projects, which is distributive in nature. Its purpose is to serve the interests of the cadets.
In fact, the lawmakers run a parallel government mechanism. One example is clearly noticeable in Province 2. Nearly one-third of over Rs 1,000 crores that were made available to the government by the federal government in equalisation grants were allocated to the 107 Assembly members. Another one-third of the grant was allotted to the civil servants. And, only one-third was left for the activities of the six ministries and the Chief Minister’s Office. Thus, the 107 lawmakers of Province 2 had as much resources at their disposal as the Provincial government itself.
However, not all lawmakers are entitled to get the funds equally under the CIDP. Though the status of the lawmakers in the Parliament or in the Provincial Assemblies is the same, they are discriminated in getting such funds.
Following the introduction of the federal system in 2017-18, only Rs 5 million each was allocated to 165 lawmakers of the House of Representatives elected for the development of their respective constituencies. Subsequently, this amount was increased to Rs 40 million in 2018-19 and to Rs 60 million in 2019-20. But no such fund was given to the remaining 110 lawmakers elected under the proportional system. Instead of making any compromise on the judicious use of the CIDP funds, there is a tendency of the lawmakers to increase its volume. Often, cutting across the party lines, the lawmakers are united in opposing any criteria, if at all made, aimed at controlling the misuse of CIDP funds.
Following the footpath of the lawmakers of the federal parliament, the lawmakers of the Provincial Assemblies also receive funds for the development of their respective constituencies. In Province 2, the elected lawmakers get much more funds for the development of their constituencies as compared to those elected under the proportional representation system.
The funds under the CIDP widely differ from one province to another. In Province 2, for example, the amount allotted for the development of an electoral constituency in 2017-18 was initially Rs 5 million for the period of three months or so, which was subsequently increased three times to Rs 15 million in 2018-19 and to Rs 30 million in 2019-20.
On the other hand, in Karnali Province, Rs 50 million each has been allotted to the lawmakers in the current fiscal year under the CIDP. In Sudurpaschim Province, the funds amounted to Rs 20 million in 2018-19, which increased to Rs 30 million this year. In fact, the lawmakers have no authority to spend CIDF as it encroaches upon the domain of the provincial and local governments. Additionally, there is little transparency in this system. Because of the hefty sum of money at their disposal under the CIDP, the lawmakers are not serious about enacting laws, formulating policies and conducting parliamentary hearings, which is their basic duty. They are so addicted to using the CIDP funds that they will not give it up no matter how this affects the fiscal balance.
Had there been no elected representatives at the federal, provincial and local levels, there could have been certain justification of the CIDP. The CIDP not only breeds corruption, but it is also illegal, anti-constitutional and against the core principle of federalism. It is a drain on the taxpayers’ money. Therefore, it is in the national interest to scrap it, both at the federal and provincial levels.

298,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/let-them-in/,"Visit Nepal Year (VNY) 2020 was inaugurated with much fanfare in the capital, however, there is reason to be sceptical about it being a grand success.
People are not sure if tourists will return home fully satisfied or that they will refer friends to visit this country.
Sanitation is a big issue even in the capital, and until now, Kathmandu Metropolitan City has only made the designs of the public toilets but not built them. Given the nature of dilly-dallying on its projects, it can be assumed that these toilets will not be built anytime soon.
Nepal was declared an open defecation free zone recently, and visitors must be well aware of this. However, we can easily see people answering nature’s call in open spaces for lack of enough public toilets in the capital itself.
It is almost next to impossible to cater to Kathmandu’s more than two million population with just 62 public toilets, which again are not in good condition. And, with the heavy influx of tourists, it is unlikely that they will get any respite in emergency situations.
The favourite destinations of tourists are the World Heritage Sites, and most of them are either without public toilets or even if there are, they are in pathetic condition. Out of 32 wards in KMC, nine of them have no provision of public toilets, and Lalitpur too, is without public toilets in 12 wards out of 29. At some places, work is being carried out, but at a snail’s pace.
With the formation of the new local governments, hopes were high. The proposed smart toilets are nowhere to be seen.  Even without them, the government could work on some smart ideas to remedy the situation. The city has, however, ample bathrooms in hotels, restaurants, hospitals, shopping malls, and even in private residences. So the government could collaborate with these private enterprises to narrow the gap between demand and supply. For this, such places could be awarded with a reduction in property taxes. Later, proper signage can be erected to inform tourists about private toilets, which they can use without hesitation.
This way, it becomes a win-win situation for all—tourists, government and property owners. Once the government has built enough public toilets, such service can be phased out. This, however, is unlikely to happen, so as a responsible citizen, if you happen to see a tourist looking for a loo, just let them in.

299,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/guiding-spirit/,"Of all the stress-busting means, watching aarti at temples does wonder for me. I have been to Dwarka, Somnath, Benares, Haridwar, Rajgir … especially for this purpose and came back home refreshed and rejuvenated.
Another temple, almost at our backyard, I have often been to is Dakshineswar Kalibari. In the evening I would proceed towards the building, adjacent to the main temple, where people of all hues converge. They team up and sing bhajans to the accompaniment of musical instruments, creating an aura, a divine atmosphere.
One evening, sitting on the floor, at the rear end of the gathering, my eyes suddenly fell on a person standing, dressed in shabby clothes. He seemed to be in an ecstatic mood, clapping, swaying to the beat, quite resigned to his fate. Without meaning to, he silently offered me a sage advice: What the morrow will bring should not concern you. It’s not in your hands but in His domain alone. He who looks after the birds looks after you, too. Therefore, cheer up and keep smiling at all times.
Years ago, I went to Rajkot to attend an official training course. When it got over, I took a bus to Jamnagar and then to Junagadh, where I checked in at a hotel located a little distance away from the revered Revatak Parvata range, older than the Himalayas, housing the sacred Girnar Temple. The trek to Girnar was not in the mind when I arrived there. I remember looking constantly at the top to gauze the distance still to be covered. When I reached the midpoint in the journey (9999 steps in all), I thought I could not go on anymore. Dehydrated, hungry, I sat on a stone.
After a while, I saw an elderly Gujrati lady coming my way. She carried sticks in both the hands. As she was about to pass me by, she looked at me and said: “Beta, feeling tired? When you reach there, all your pains turn to godly strength that sustains you amid worldly chaos.”
On the way down, I could not see the elderly lady anymore, without whose promptings I would not have made it to the temple, where I stayed for
an hour absorbing the pristine air the virgin forest all around exuded.
Paulo Coelho, the writer of The Alchemist, with whom I’d the fortune to correspond for a while, urges the reader to be aware of the angelic presence assigned by God along the path you are destined to pass through. The man at Dakshineswar and this lady at Girnar were certainly godsend for me.

300,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-make-firms-liable/,"The govt should introduce tough laws that make the contractors accountable for any delay in completing the contracts they have won
The Public Procurement Monitoring Office (PPMO) under the Prime Minister’s Office on Friday decided to blacklist Pappu-Raman Construction Company and 330 other companies and suppliers for their failure to complete government contracts on time. The joint venture company, which has bagged many government contracts, especially bridges, was blacklisted as per the recommendation of the Postal Highway Directorate under the Department of Roads. The joint venture company was removed from the government’s list for one year beginning August, as per the PPMO guidelines. Earlier, the Postal Highway Directorate had made a recommendation to blacklist Pappu-Raman JV after it failed to complete the construction of Narayani Bridge within the set deadline in 2016. Interesting to note, however, is that Raman Construction has been awarded to build the Dharahara. Pappu Construction has won several government contracts, including bridges, across the country. But it has either delayed the construction works for years or whatever bridges it has built are substandard. One bridge at Teku over the Bishnumati River has been closed after it was found to be substandard and another contract awarded to it to build a bridge at Tinkune over the Bagmati River has been terminated due to its faulty design and the use of substandard materials.
The PPMO has said that companies and suppliers that have won contracts but failed to complete the works on time and whose works have been found substandard were being put under the scanner. Those companies and suppliers had won government contracts for over a decade. As per the Public Procurement Act, 2063 B.S., such companies and suppliers whose works are dismal can be blacklisted for one to three years from taking part in the bidding processes of government contracts. In its latest report, the CIAA has stated that as many as 848 government projects are in total mess even though various companies and suppliers have already received payment worth Rs 20 billion from the government coffers under the ‘mobilisation fund’, which they use for other purposes.
Taking this into account, Prime Minister KP Oli on November 25 instructed all the government agencies to remove those firms that had failed to complete the works on time from the contractors’ list. Around 50 companies and suppliers were blacklisted last year, while 22 other firms that flouted the contract rules have been blacklisted this fiscal, according to Rajesh Thapa, director at the PPMO. Although the legal action against the non-performing firms is highly welcome, the move is too late, too little, given the amount of time and money the government has lost over so many years. Delay in completing the works not only causes a huge loss to the state but also affects the public, who could have reaped benefits from them if completed on time. Such firms should be blacklisted not for one or two years but forever for dereliction of their duty. It is high time the government introduced a bill in Parliament allowing the government to cancel the licenses of those firms that deliberately fail to complete the works within the deadline.

Stay safe
As temperatures drop, both in the capital and elsewhere, people are turning to different ways to keep themselves warm or heat water to take a bath. While solar heaters are sprouting on rooftops everywhere, people, especially those living in rented homes, use a gas water geyser to heat water in the bathroom. While the gadget is safe, if precautionary measures are used, unfortunately, it has caused accidents, with a teenager living in a girl’s hostel in Kathmandu being the latest victim. Suffocation due to carbon monoxide poisoning while taking a bath has been blamed for her death, and even treatment at Patan Hospital could not revive her.
Modern gadgets apart, people also use traditional charcoal stoves to keep themselves warm in poorly ventilated rooms. As a result, quite a few accidents are reported year after year. While we cannot stop people from using modern gadgets and traditional appliances to keep themselves warm, what we can do is alert them about the pitfalls through the different media. Now that most people own a mobile phone in the country, social media could be very effective in informing them about the precautions to be taken while using gadgets.

301,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/unproductive-cattle-know-their-economic-value/,"Recent studies reveal that raising unproductive cattle, especially for manure and later for their by-products – skin and bones – could be highly profitable. Cow dung is a cheap and easily available bio-resource for agricultural use
The dry cows unable to give milk due to old age and the bulls not used for agricultural purpose are considered unproductive in Nepal. As they cannot be killed or exported, these unproductive cattle compete for fodder, water, space and other expenses, which is an economic burden on the farmers. In Nepal, the cow holds religious sentiments for the Hindu people. She provides milk and is worshipped as Laxmi. Similarly, the male cattle play an important role in agriculture, and are used for ploughing, transportation, irrigation, threshing and other works.
The total cattle population is estimated at 7.5 million heads, of which 55 per cent are males. Of the female cattle population, only 15 per cent give milk while 15 per cent are below three years of age.
Of the female cattle, 10 per cent are old and unproductive. In the case of males, only 20 per cent are either used in agricultural work or for breeding purposes, while the rest stay idle. Only about 13 per cent of the cattle are of the exotic breed, namely Jersey and Holstein.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
The average life span of cattle is about 15-20 years. A typical cow gives birth to its first calf at the age of 2-3 years and starts producing milk, and subsequent calving takes place at intervals of every 12-15 months. During her life time, a cow will give birth to eight calves, by when she is 10-12 years old.
The remaining years the cow remains dry and does not give milk. So its economic value starts declining. But the cows will need to be provided fodder, water, vaccinations and medication, should they fall sick, as well as sheds, which involve heavy expenses. Similarly, rearing a weaned male calve when a cow stops giving milk is a heavy economic burden on the farmers.
In recent years, commercial dairy farming and use of high yielding exotic cattle breeds are increasing, so is mechanisation of agriculture and use of artificial insemination for breeding.
Recent developments in breeding technology have also made it possible to produce only female calves. So the use of bulls in agriculture is declining. It is estimated that there are four million unproductive cattle, of which one million cows are dry while the remaining three million males largely stay idle.
In such a situation, often the unproductive cattle are chased away from the farm and forced to live like stray animals, although this is forbidden by law.
The stray cattle often wander around in search of food and water, and resort to stealing food and crops. Every year, a significant number of cattle die in road accidents or from dehydration, starvation, infections and parasites. In the cities, stray animals cause traffic nuisance.
Although illegal, a large number of cattle are also exported to Indian states and even Bangladesh.
The government, municipalities as well as community-based welfare organisations have been providing shelters for the stray cows at places and imposing penalties on the owners for abandoning the cows.
However, these cow shelters lack sufficient fodder and potable water, space, veterinary support and other necessary facilities. Given the people’s sentiments, laws and regulations, the cattle even after their productive life should be protected, and minimum care should be provided, not abandoned. But it is reported that during the period of 2012- 2015, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City alone had rounded up 1,200 abandoned
cattle, which were later auctioned off.
Recent studies reveal that raising unproductive cattle, especially for manure and later for their by-products – skin and bones – could be highly profitable. Cow dung is a cheap and easily available bio-resource for agricultural use. It is a major source for the production of biogas in Nepal.
If all the dung produced by cows and buffaloes is used as manure, Nepal will not need to import urea. If the dung and urine are collected systematically and well managed, there is enough money to be made.
For example, on average, an adult cow gives 5,475 kilos of dung and 1,460 litres of urine per year, which is equivalent to 2,956 kilos of nitrogen.
This nitrogen can be converted into 6,500 kilos of urea fertiliser, which based on the existing market price, is worth Rs 97,500. If the disposal price of each unproductive cattle is Rs 5,000 and fodder and management cost an extra 40,000, still the rearing of an old unproductive cow or bull could give a profit of Rs 50,000 a year.
More importantly, commercial harvesting of urine and dung for religious purposes could be a potential enterprise in managing the unproductive cattle.
For example, the urine obtained from indigenous cows is considered holy and said to have medicinal value in Ayurveda.
Some entrepreneurs are starting to bottle cow urine for marketing locally as well as in the international market. Similarly, cow dung is required for religious rituals.
Another option to manage the unproductive cattle is to establish cow sanctuaries, similar to protected wildlife areas, where they can roam freely. Such a cattle sanctuary could be fused with a vulture restaurant, where the carcass could serve as food for the birds and other wild carnivorous.
Since unproductive cattle are an economic burden to the farmers, the government should establish cow shelters in every municipality to protect their rights and use their waste to promote organic farming.

302,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-shortage-of-nurses/,"There is a huge demand for nurses in the developed world, and it is easy to tempt them with good pay and facilities
A shortage of nurses in state-run hospitals could put the country’s healthcare system under increased strain in the coming days, dampening the government’s effort to provide quality care to its citizens. According to the Nursing and Social Security Division under the Department of Health Services, the government health institutions employ just 15,000 nurses as against a demand for three times that number. This backlog is largely because of the government’s failure to increase the number of posts for nurses in the last 26 years despite an increase in the number of hospital beds and exponential growth in patient numbers. The nurses are thus overloaded and overworked. The widening nurse-to-patient ratio has telling effect on service delivery, with frequent complaints about the nurses’ rude behaviour and poor attendance to patients. Big health institutions, such as the Bir Hospital and TU Teaching Hospital (TUTH) in Kathmandu, for instance, are simply overwhelmed by an influx of patients from every nook and corner of the country. Other specialised hospitals face a similar situation during outbreaks of diseases, which have become commonplace, putting undue stress on the nurses.
While government hospitals are already constrained by a shortage of nurses, retaining them is becoming even more difficult, forcing the health institutions to hire them on short contracts. TUTH is the first choice of most nurses, but it sees them moving out in droves year after year despite the good facilities and perks offered to them. There is a huge demand for nurses in the developed world, and it is easy to tempt such professionals from countries like Nepal with good pay and facilities. About 91,000 nurses, auxiliary nurse midwives and foreign nurses are registered with the Nepal Nursing Council. About 7,500 nurses graduate annually from the 120 nursing colleges in the country.
Managing the huge number of nurses generated annually in the country is a challenge that the government can ill-afford to overlook. A good deal of the problem of underemployment of unemployment of nurses could be resolved if the government were to create posts in the hospitals and recruit them. Ideally, a nurse should be attending to just six patients in a general ward, four in a paediatric ward or one in an intensive care unit. But in Nepal, you might find a nurse tending to twice or even three times the number. With the expansion or addition of new units in government hospitals, such as the Bir Hospital, they will require additional nurses by the hundreds. There must be no procrastination in staffing the state-run health institutions with the required number of nurses so as to maintain the desired nurse-to-patient ratio. It is also desired that the nurses are given appropriate pay, especially in the private health centres. It costs anywhere between Rs 300,000 and Rs 1.2 million, depending upon the level, and a lot of endurance to become a nurse, and it is only right they are well reimbursed for the hard work that they put into taking care of the patients. Only when there is appropriate pay, a secure future and professional security, will the country be able to prevent qualified nurses from seeking greener pastures abroad.

Power for local levels
The central government is gradually handing over power to the provincial and local levels when it comes to sharing natural resources, including water, mines, mountains and forests. Sharing of water resources for building hydel and irrigation projects will help boost economic activities at the local and provincial levels. Recently, the government transferred 25 per cent share of the income from natural resources to the local levels, which they can invest for the well-being of their communities.
In yet another development, the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation is amending the Electricity Act in the current session of the Federal Parliament. Once this Act is amended, the local levels will have the authority to select promoters to develop hydel projects with a capacity of less than 3 megawatts. The draft bill envisages allowing the local levels to award contracts to build such projects. Until now, all types of hydel projects are decided by the central government. The centre will only decide on such projects if they are located in two provinces. This provision will include the three tiers of government in sharing of power and water resources as per the spirit of the federal system.

303,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/cooperative-movement-in-nepal-still-going-strong/,"The number of cooperatives must be reduced through acquisition or merger. But to encourage more and more cooperatives to do so, attractive incentives like a reduction in corporate tax need to be introduced
The cooperative movement in Nepal began with the establishment of the first cooperative – Bakhan Multi-purpose Cooperative Institute – in Chitwan way back in 1957. With it, the first Cooperative Act was enacted in 1960. The cooperative movement, however, did not pick up momentum until the 1980s, when a large number of community-based savings and credit cooperatives came up across Nepal. In fact, liberalisation and open market economy in the 1990s also helped the emergence of cooperatives in the country. As the cooperative movement spread to every nook and cranny of the country, the need for forming an apex coordinating body was acutely felt. As such, the Nepal Federation of Savings and Credit Cooperative Unions (NEFSCUN) was formed in 1988.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
The first People’s Movement brought about sweeping political changes in the country in the early 1990s. The monolithic Panchayat dispensation gave way to multi-party democracy, and the waves of liberalisation and open market economy swept the country as in the rest of the world. The cooperative movement also got a further boost. So to give a further shot-in-the-arm to the cooperative sector, another Cooperative Act was promulgated in 1992. The Act clearly stated that the government would no longer directly promote cooperatives, indicating they would have to flourish on their own. As desired by the government, cooperatives have since been growing by leaps and bounds. The Constitution of Nepal 2015 has recognised cooperatives as one of the three pillars of the national economy. Another Cooperative Act was promulgated in 2018 to help cooperatives keep abreast of the changing times.
The constitution has envisioned national prosperity through the participation of public, private and cooperative sectors. Cooperatives can, like other financial players, help notch up entrepreneurial development by promoting micro-, medium- and big-scale enterprises in the country, besides creating job opportunities.
The cooperatives’ contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) is around 4 per cent, whereas their contribution to the financial sector stands at around 20 per cent. There are around 35,000 cooperatives in the country with 6.3 million members, out of which women constitute 50 per cent. Over 60,000 people are directly employed in cooperatives.
In the changed context, cooperatives should adopt new technology and amplify their role in production, distribution and service sectors by diversifying their business. Division cooperative offices have now been dissolved throughout the country and local and provincial governments have been assigned to look after and regulate cooperatives. Local and provincial governments can promulgate and implement the laws relating to cooperatives.
Given the large number of cooperatives, the government is now mulling reducing their number as it is difficult for the government to monitor, supervise and regulate them.
The Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), where there are 1,856 cooperatives at present, has initiated the process of merging cooperatives. The KMC aims at reducing their number to just 700. There are around 200,000 people associated with the cooperatives. These cooperatives have mobilised around Rs 52 billion and disbursed loans to the tune of around Rs 41 billion.
As an incentive, cooperatives that go into a merger will be exempted from a municipal tax for five years. The rate of municipal tax is Rs 5,000 per year. Till now, four cooperatives based in the Kathmandu Metropolis have merged. The KMC is hopeful that more will go for a merger in the future. The KMC has now halted the process of incorporating new cooperatives. However, this restriction is not applied to cooperatives to be promoted by labourers. At one time, the government gave free rein to the establishment of cooperatives. Consequently, cooperatives have mushroomed to such an extent that it has been like an albatross around the neck of the government. Together with the number of cooperatives, the government is also trying to reduce the number of commercial banks, development banks and finance companies.
This is all due to a lack of far-sight on the part of the government. Anyway, it has dawned on the government that in a small economy like ours, the number of financial players is still large. Economic experts also opine that such financial players should be reduced drastically and that quality should be preferred to quantity.
There is no argument against reducing the number of cooperatives through acquisition or merger. But to encourage more and more cooperatives to opt for acquisition or merger, sufficient incentives need to be provided. Small incentives like exemption from payment of municipal tax for five years may not do the trick. Other attractive incentives like a reduction in corporate tax need to be introduced.
In the final analysis, cooperatives are important players in the financial sector. They can play a pivotal role in uplifting the economic conditions of the people, especially those living in the rural areas. While it is important to drastically reduce their number, at the same time they should also be minutely monitored so as to improve their management, beef up their internal control and, more importantly, check irregularities for the growth of the cooperative sector.

304,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/making-visit-nepal-2020-a-success/,"Last week, the government and Kathmandu Metropolitan City rang in the New Year and inaugurated Visit Nepal 2020 with an affected display of fireworks and marching bands at the Dashrath Stadium to support the national tourism campaign. Visit Nepal 2020 is a yearlong campaign, which was announced by the government in May 2018. The campaign was announced with the high expectation of attracting 2 million foreign tourists. The slogan of visit Nepal 2020 is “Lifetime experiences”.
For the past one-and-a-half years, it has been promoted in social media. But the government appears quite indifferent to making basic urban amenities available for tourists, such as public toilets, garbage cans and proper public transport. It is a big problem in all the urban areas of Nepal, even at the major tourist destinations, such as the World Heritage Sites.
At Patan Durbar Square and the Swayambhunath Temple, there are tourist lavatories but not a single toilet for tourists in Pashupati. Bathrooms at the most visited places like Pashupati, Ratnapark and Basantpur are often messy with water shortage. The lack of toilets is a problem faced by Kathmandu’s residents as well.
We see dust everywhere, in the streets, on the road and in public parks. It’s hard to find a dustbin to dispose of garbage.
For lack of dustbins, people just throw garbage everywhere. I was watching live the inauguration of the Visit Nepal 2020 on YouTube, when one foreigner sitting near to me seemed bothered by the chaotic traffic. He said, “I am from Russia. I have been facing the same problem for the past one week. Is the traffic jam always like this?” I felt so bad that I didn’t say anything.
The Kathmandu Valley boasts of seven World Heritage Sites, but the traffic congestion and narrow footpaths make getting around extremely difficult.
So how will tourists enjoy their stay in the city amidst all these problems? Will they get a lifetime experience according to the slogan of the Visit Nepal 2020? Will they really inspire other people to visit Nepal?
No doubt, Nepal is naturally a very beautiful country where the world’s highest mountain, Everest, is located, and it is also famous for being the birthplace of Gautam Buddha.
But the government needs to provide basic infrastructure and amenities for tourists if it really wants to make Visit Nepal 2020 a grand success.

A rewards point mechanism can be established for those travellers providing constructive feedback
Visit Nepal 2020 has been launched with the slogan ‘Experiences of a lifetime’. Given the steady growth in travel worldwide, the number of tourists visiting Nepal this year will definitely increase.
Travel is an exciting experience for everyone. At every stage of travel, from the time of searching for destinations, planning the itinerary, selecting and booking service providers, experiencing the travel itself, sharing the experience to reflecting on those experiences and possibly returning for similar experiences, every traveller needs the right information. Travellers seek for thrills, adventures or even inner peace in their travel itinerary.

Nepali hospitality and tourism service providers are facing challenges in providing the right information and services to the right travellers at the right time. The need of exposure in the global market to be chosen by travellers is ever increasing. After travellers embark on their journey, providing the right service with the right set of tools and technology, and automating communications and business operations add other challenges in providing a good experience to the travellers.
While searching for travel destination, travellers use search engines, social media networks, travel portals as well as word of mouth recommendations. Nepali hospitality and tourism service providers have catered their websites well using search engine optimisations to position the websites for better search results, listed their property and profiles on social media and travel portals for global reach. In addition, use of branding and targeted marketing strategy, world-class branding materials and designs, detailed dynamic itinerary of tours, virtual tours of hotels and other places of attractions, and prompt response to queries will enhance the possibility of a traveller selecting Nepal as their destination.
Booking for hotels and tours in Nepal has been most challenging for international as well as domestic travellers. On one hand, booking via global service providers incurs heavy commission whereas on the other hand, opting out from these global service providers and limiting to domestic booking service providers only shrinks global reach. Booking via agencies and third party service aggregators also has similar problems due to multiple intermediaries.
Nepali online booking service providers can play a key role by building trust and facilitating international payment via their portals to reduce the number of intermediaries and hefty booking commissions. Integrating with international payment gateways and insurance providers, implementing security measures on servers, web apps, mobile apps, maintaining privacy of customers, and assurance of cancellation policy play key role in building trust with international travellers and adoption of Nepali online booking service providers.
Upon arrival of travellers, Nepali service providers need to make sure that they get most out of their visit. Allowing the right choice of services and products to the traveller is very important. Use of Point-of-Sale machines, information desks/kiosks, and mobile apps with Augmented Reality (AR) enhance the experience of travel. The stay of a traveller needs to be comfortable and secure enough. Information about local events and activities, specialties in food and culture shows add value to the service provided. Practice of secure payment, use of global security certifications and digital door locks with security builds the confidence of travellers on the service providers.
Every traveller wants to reflect, recommend and possibly return to similar experiences after a travel completes. Not all travels result in a pleasant experience. It is the responsibility of the hospitality and tourism service providers to make sure no stone is left unturned to avoid unpleasant experiences of travellers. Various online platforms are available for travellers to reflect on their travel experiences as well as provide a rating of their stay/travel. Nepali service providers can use social media and other portals to highlight the good experiences collected by travellers during their stay. A rewards point mechanism can be established for those travellers providing constructive feedback. Similarly, reward points can be allocated to returning customers.
Using information and communication technology to target travellers, reach them with proper branding and marketing contents, facilitate the booking and payment process, enhance their experience and ensure their return is possible by the Nepali hospitality and tourism service providers. Nepali service providers can benefit by identifying prospective customers, enhancing their experience and retaining them for long-term with the practice of customer relationship management systems.
Tools for customer relationship management help capture travellers’ data, analyse the data in terms of their demography, geography and psychography, identify exceptional cases by using business intelligence tools so that the service providers can get a snapshot of their business at will. Technology also allows the service providers to build an alliance so that travellers can get integrated services from different service providers. With the right set of technology use in the hospitality and tourism industry, Nepal surely can achieve the target of Visit Nepal 2020.

306,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/spacex-says-picture-perfect-test-paves-way-for-human-mission/,"CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA: Elon Musk’s SpaceX simulated a successful emergency landing on Sunday in a dramatic test of a crucial abort system on an unmanned astronaut capsule, a big step its mission to fly NASA astronauts for the first time as soon as this spring.
A Crew Dragon astronaut capsule launched at 10:30 a.m. and softly splashed down about 19 miles (32 km) off the coast of Cape Canaveral in Florida about eight minutes later, after ejecting itself from a rocket that cut off its engines 12 miles (19 km) above the ocean to mimic a launch failure.
Crew Dragon detached from the Falcon 9 rocket at “more than double the speed of sound,” Musk told reporters, at 131,000 feet (40km) above the Atlantic Ocean — roughly twice the altitude of a commercial jetliner.
“It is a picture perfect mission. It went as well as one can possibly expect,” Musk said at a press conference.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration administrator Jim Bridenstine also described the test as a success.
The first mission with humans aboard, which will be the final test mission before NASA’s commercial crew program becomes operational, is scheduled for the second quarter of this year, after the spacecraft is completed no later than March, Musk said.
In what was a key trial ahead of carrying humans, SpaceX also tested its rescue teams’ response after splash down. They scrambled toward Crew Dragon with the US Air Force’s Detachment 3 emergency rescue teams in tow — a vital part of the test to practice a rescue mission to retrieve astronauts from the capsule.
Crew Dragon, an acorn-shaped pod that can seat seven astronauts, fired on-board thrusters to detach itself from the rocket less than two minutes after liftoff, simulating an emergency abort scenario to prove it can return astronauts to safety. Each stage of the test prompted loud cheers from SpaceX crew members watching the footage from back on land.
The test is crucial to qualify the capsule to fly humans to the International Space Station, something NASA expects to come as soon as mid-2020. It follows years of development and delays as the United States has sought to revive its human spaceflight program through private partnerships.
NASA awarded $4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.5 billion to SpaceX in 2014 to develop separate capsule systems capable of ferrying astronauts to the space station from US soil for the first time since NASA’s space shuttle program ended in 2011. The space agency has since relied on Russian spacecraft for rides to the space station. During the test Crew Dragon used its so-called SuperDraco thrusters to jet itself away from the rocket at supersonic speeds of up to 1,500 miles per hour (2,400 kph). The Falcon 9 booster free-fell back to the ocean, with its first stage crashing into the waves and creating a tall plume of smoke seen on the horizon.
The capsule deployed four parachutes to slow its descent, and carried two human-shaped test dummies on seats fitted with motion sensors to collect data on the immense g-force — the effect of acceleration on the body — astronauts would be subjected to during abort.
The test was originally scheduled for mid-2019 but was delayed after a Crew Dragon capsule exploded in April on a test stand just before firing its launch abort thrusters, triggering a lengthy investigation.
SpaceX-led investigators in July zeroed in on a previously unknown explosive reaction between a titanium valve and a propellant used to ignite the thrusters. A SpaceX official said the company completed the investigation within the last week.

307,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nations-dawdle-on-agreeing-rules-to-control-killer-robots-in-future-wars/,"NAIROBI: Countries are rapidly developing “killer robots” – machines with artificial intelligence (AI) that independently kill – but are moving at a snail’s pace on agreeing global rules over their use in future wars, warn technology and human rights experts.
From drones and missiles to tanks and submarines, semi-autonomous weapons systems have been used for decades to eliminate targets in modern day warfare – but they all have human supervision.
Nations such as the United States, Russia and Israel are now investing in developing lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) which can identify, target, and kill a person all on their own – but to date there are no international laws governing their use.
“Some kind of human control is necessary … Only humans can make context-specific judgements of distinction, proportionality and precautions in combat,” said Peter Maurer, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
“(Building consensus) is the big issue we are dealing with and unsurprisingly, those who have today invested a lot of capacities and do have certain skill which promise advantages to them, are more reluctant than those who don’t.”
The ICRC oversaw the adoption of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that define the laws of war and the rights of civilians to protection and assistance during conflicts and it engages with governments to adapt these rules to modern warfare.
AI researchers, defence analysts and roboticists say LAWS such as military robots are no longer confined to the realm of science fiction or video games, but are fast progressing from graphic design boards to defence engineering laboratories.
Within a few years, they could be deployed by state militaries to the battlefield, they add, painting dystopian scenarios of swarms of drones moving through a town or city, scanning and selectively killing their targets within seconds.
DEATH BY ALGORITHM
This has raised ethical concerns from human rights groups and some tech experts who say giving machines the power of life and death violates the principles of human dignity.
Not only are LAWS vulnerable to interference and hacking which would result in increased civilian deaths, they add, but their deployment would raise questions over who would be held accountable in the event of misuse.
“Don’t be mistaken by the nonsense of how intelligent these weapons will be,” said Noel Sharkey, chairman of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control.
“You simply can’t trust an algorithm – no matter how smart – to seek out, identify and kill the correct target, especially in the complexity of war,” said Sharkey, who is also an AI and robotics expert at Britain’s University of Sheffield.
Experts in defence-based AI systems argue such weapons, if developed well, can make war more humane.
They will be more precise and efficient, not fall prey to human emotions such as fear or vengeance and minimise deaths of civilians and soldiers, they add.
“From a military’s perspective, the primary concern is to protect the security of the country with the least amount of lives lost – and that means its soldiers,” said Anuj Sharma, chairman of India Research Centre, which works on AI warfare.
“So if you can remove the human out of the equation as much as possible, it’s a win because it means less body bags going back home – and that’s what everyone wants.”
AVOIDABLE TRAGEDY
A 2019 survey by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a global coalition, found 61% of people across 26 countries, including the United States and Israel, opposed the development of fully autonomous lethal weapons.
Mary Wareham, HRW’s arms division advocacy director, said countries have held eight meetings under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons since 2014 to discuss the issue, but there has been no progress.
Thirty nations including Brazil, Austria and Canada are in favour of a total ban, while dozens of others want a treaty to establish some form of control over the use of LAWS, said Wareham, also coordinator of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots.
This is largely due to a few, powerful nations like the United States and Russia who say it is premature to move towards regulation, without first defining such weapons, she said.
The US State Department said it supported the discussions at the UN, but that “dictating a particular format for an outcome before working through the substance” would not result in the best outcome.
“The United States has opposed calls to develop a ban and does not support opening negotiations, whether on a legally binding instrument or a political declaration, at this time,” said a US state department spokesperson in a statement.
“We must not be anti-technology and must be cautious not to make hasty judgments about emerging or future technologies especially given how ‘smart’ precision-guided weapons have allowed responsible militaries to reduce risks to civilians in military operations,” it added.
Officials from Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“It’s not good enough that we moving forward into the 21st century without set rules,” said Wareham, adding that without oversight, more nations would develop lethal autonomous weapons.
“We need to have a new international treaty as we have for landmines and cluster munitions. We have to prevent the avoidable tragedy that is coming if we do not regulate our killer robots.”

308,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/deep-sea-microbe-sheds-light-on-primordial-evolutionary-milestone/,"WASHINGTON: A microorganism scooped up in deep–sea mud off Japan’s coast has helped scientists unlock the mystery of one of the watershed evolutionary events for life on Earth: the transition from the simple cells that first colonised the planet to complex cellular life – fungi, plants and animals including people.
Researchers said on Wednesday they were able to study the biology of the microorganism, retrieved from depths of about 1.5 miles (2.5 km), after coaxing it to grow in the laboratory. They named it Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum, referring to the Greek mythological figure Prometheus who created humankind from clay and stole fire from the gods.


Prometheoarchaeum’s spherical cell – with a diameter of roughly 500 nanometers, or one-20,000th of a centimeter – boasts long, often branching tentacle-like appendages on its outer surface.
It is part of a group called Archaea, relatively simple single-cell organisms lacking internal structures such as a nucleus. Scientists have long puzzled over the evolutionary shift from such simple bacteria-like cells to the first rudimentary fungi, plants and animals – a group called eukaryotes – perhaps 2 billion years ago.
Based on a painstaking laboratory study of Prometheoarchaeum and observations of its symbiotic – mutually beneficial – relationship with a companion bacterium, the researchers offered an explanation.
They proposed that appendages like those of Prometheoarchaeum entangled a passing bacterium, which was then engulfed and eventually evolved into an organelle – internal structure – called a mitochondrion that is the powerhouse of a cell and crucial for respiration and energy production.
The solar system including Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago. The first life on Earth, simple marine microbes, appeared roughly 4 billion years ago. The later advent of eukaryotes set in motion evolutionary paths that led to a riotous assemblage of organisms over the eons like palm trees, blue whales, T. rex, hummingbirds, clownfish, shiitake mushrooms, lobsters, daisies, woolly mammoths and Marilyn Monroe.
“How we – as eukaryotes – originated is a fundamental question related to how we – as humans – came to be,” said microbiologist Masaru Nobu of Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, one of the leaders of the study published in the journal Nature.
Prometheoarchaeum is a member of a subgroup called Asgard archaea – named for the dwelling place of the gods in Norse mythology. Other members of this subgroup were retrieved from the frigid seabed near a hydrothermal vent system called Loki’s Castle, named after a Norse mythological figure, between Greenland and Norway.
The research on Prometheoarchaeum, Nobu said, indicates that the Asgard archaea are the closest living relatives to the first eukaryotes.
The researchers used a submersible research vessel to collect mud containing Prometheoarchaeum from the Omine Ridge off Japan in 2006. They studied it in the laboratory in a years-long process and watched it slowly proliferate after incubating the samples in a vessel infused with methane gas to simulate the deep–sea marine sediment environment in which it resides.
“We were able to obtain the first complete genome of this group of archaea and conclusively show that these archaea possess many genes that had been thought to be only found in eukaryotes,” Nobu said.
Prometheoarchaeum was found to be reliant on its companion bacterium.
“The organism ‘eats’ amino acids through symbiosis with a partner,” Nobu said. “This is because the organism can neither fully digest amino acids by itself, gain energy if any byproducts have accumulated, nor build its own cell without external help.”

309,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nsa-finds-major-security-flaw-in-windows-10-free-fix-issued/,"The National Security Agency has discovered a major security flaw in Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system that could let hackers intercept seemingly secure communications.
But rather than exploit the flaw for its own intelligence needs, the NSA tipped off Microsoft so that it can fix the system for everyone.
Microsoft released a free software patch to fix the flaw Tuesday and credited the intelligence agency for discovering it. The company said it has not seen any evidence that hackers have used the technique.
Amit Yoran, CEO of security firm Tenable, said it is “exceptionally rare if not unprecedented” for the US government to share its discovery of such a critical vulnerability with a company.
Yoran, who was a founding director of the Department of Homeland Security’s computer emergency readiness team, urged all organizations to prioritize patching their systems quickly.
An advisory sent by the NSA on Tuesday said “the consequences of not patching the vulnerability are severe and widespread.”
Microsoft said an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by spoofing a code-signing certificate so it looked like a file came from a trusted source.
“The user would have no way of knowing the file was malicious, because the digital signature would appear to be from a trusted provider,” the company said.
If successfully exploited, attackers would have been able to conduct “man-in-the-middle attacks” and decrypt confidential information they intercept on user connections, the company said.
“The biggest risk is to secure communications,” said Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence for security firm CrowdStrike.
Some computers will get the fix automatically, if they have the automatic update option turned on. Others can get it manually by going to Windows Update in the computer’s settings.
Microsoft typically releases security and other updates once a month and waited until Tuesday to disclose the flaw and the NSA’s involvement. Microsoft and the NSA both declined to say when the agency privately notified the company.
The agency shared the vulnerability with Microsoft “quickly and responsibly,” Neal Ziring, technical director of the NSA’s cybersecurity directorate, said in a blog post Tuesday.
Priscilla Moriuchi, who retired from the NSA in 2017 after running its East Asia and Pacific operations, said this is a good example of the “constructive role” that the NSA can play in improving global information security. Moriuchi, now an analyst at the US cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said it’s likely a reflection of changes made in 2017 to how the US determines whether to disclose a major vulnerability or exploit it for intelligence purposes.
The revamping of what’s known as the “Vulnerability Equities Process” put more emphasis on disclosing vulnerabilities whenever possible to protect core internet systems and the US economy and general public.
Those changes happened after a mysterious group calling itself the “Shadow Brokers” released a trove of high-level hacking tools stolen from the NSA, forcing companies including Microsoft to repair their systems. The US believes that North Korea and Russia were able to capitalize on those stolen hacking tools to unleash devastating global cyberattacks.

TBILISI: Popular dating apps like Grindr and OkCupid share personal data about users, including their location and sexuality, with about 100 other businesses, a Norwegian consumer group said on Tuesday, as it filed a complaint about breach of privacy rules.
The Norwegian Consumer Council found that 10 widely used Android apps that gather sensitive data about health, drug use, and sexual preferences passed some of it on to advertising and marketing firms without clearly informing users.

“These practices are out of control and in breach of European data protection legislation,” said Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy for the Norwegian Consumer Council.
“It is impossible for users to control this because the terms and conditions are really long and impossible to understand,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Tech companies have come under increased scrutiny over data privacy, fuelled by 2018’s Cambridge Analytica scandal in which tens of millions of Facebook profiles were harvested without their users’ consent.
The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), implemented in 2018, heavily restricts companies’ ability to process and share personal information without users’ consent, with hefty fines for firms that break the rules.
The Norwegian Consumer Council filed a complaint on Tuesday against the U.S.-based gay dating app Grindr and companies receiving data from it with Norway’s data authority, which said it was looking into whether they had broken GDPR rules.
Grindr said it rejected some of the report’s conclusions, adding that its privacy policy was shared with all users, who had individual control over what information they chose to provide in their profiles.
“As the data protection landscape continues to change, our commitment to user privacy remains steadfast,” the company said in a statement.
The council’s study found that the app, which is used by millions globally, shares data with a large number of third parties involved in advertising and profiling, many of which reserve the right to pass it on to others.
“Sharing location data for gay people can be risky in certain extreme circumstances,” Norway’s data protection commissioner Bjorn Erik Thon, said in a statement.
“There are still some who do not want to be open about their orientation, and there are many countries in the world where being gay carries great risks.”
The study also found that OkCupid shares information from users’ personal profiles related to sexuality, drug use and political views with an analytics company, while the dating app Tinder shares location and age with marketing firms.
The Match Group, which owns OkCupid and Tinder, said in a statement that it used third party providers to assist its services but only shared information deemed necessary to operate its platforms, in line with the applicable laws.
“Privacy is at the core of our business,” the company said.

SHANGHAI: China on Saturday officially opened operations of the world’s largest radio telescope, which it will use for space research and help in the hunt for extraterrestrial life, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST, is the size of 30 football fields and has been hewed out of a mountain in the southwestern province of Guizhou. It is also known by the name “Sky Eye” in China.
Xinhua reported that the telescope had received national approval to start operations. It finished construction in 2016 and has been undergoing debugging and tests in the years since.
FAST’s Chief Engineer Jiang Peng told Xinhua that the telescope’s trial operations had so far been reliable and stable, and that its sensitivity was more than 2.5 times that of the world’s second-largest telescope.
The project has also obtained some valuable scientific data over that time and is expected to help lead to some breakthroughs in areas such as low-frequency gravitational wave detection and interstellar molecules in the next three to five years, Xinhua said.
Advancing China’s space programme is a priority for Beijing, and the country has set a target to catch up with Russia and the United States and become a major space power by 2030.
Beijing plans to launch construction of its own manned space station next year.

312,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/faeces-smeared-fakes-scientists-use-rubber-hands-in-ocd-therapy/,"LONDON: A new type of therapy using faeces and fake rubber hands may be able to help patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) overcome their fears of touching contaminated surfaces, according to new research.
“OCD can be an extremely debilitating condition for many people, but the treatments are not always straightforward,” said Baland Jalal, a Cambridge University neuroscientist who was part of a team assessing if rubber hands could be a potential new type of exposure therapy.

Traditional exposure therapy often involves instructing OCD patients to touch contaminated surfaces, such as a toilet seat, and then to not wash their hands. It aims to help patients control their fears in a safe, managed environment but many find it too difficult and cannot even begin therapy.
The Anglo-US trial involved patients having a fake hand and watching it being stroked until they developed a sensation that it was their own. The rubber hand was then smeared with faeces while their real hand was dabbed with damp tissue to mimic the feeling of faeces touching their skin.
The patients were asked to rate their disgust and anxiety levels, and the strength of the urge to wash their hands.
“Exposure therapy can be very stressful and so is not always effective or even feasible for many patients,” said Jalal.
“If you can provide an indirect treatment that’s reasonably realistic, where you contaminate a rubber hand instead of a real hand, this might provide a bridge that will allow more people to tolerate exposure therapy or even replace (it) altogether.”
Obsessive compulsive disorder is a psychiatric condition that affects as many as one in 50 people worldwide. It can have a serious impact on people’s lives, mental health, relationships and ability to hold down a job.
OCD comes in various types, one of which is characterised by severe contamination fears – even from touching everyday things like switches or door handles – leading to excessive washing.
Jalal said the results of the rubber hand study, which were published on Thursday in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, suggest fake hand contamination may help.
“The rubber hand illusion often makes people laugh at first, helping put them at ease,” he said. “It’s also straightforward and cheap compared to virtual reality, and so can easily reach patients in distress no matter where they are.”

Twitter Inc said on Wednesday it will test new features early this year that would allow users to control who can reply to their tweets, as it looks to limit abuse and harassment on the platform.
Social media firms are under pressure to address harassment on their sites, which often occurs in unsolicited replies targeting women and minorities, and Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey has promised since 2018 to increase the “health” of public conversation.
“We want to help people feel safe participating in the conversation on Twitter by giving them more control over the conversations they start,” the San Francisco-based company said in a tweet.
The company had launched a feature late last year allowing users to hide certain replies on their tweets as a part of its efforts to clean up abusive content and make the social media platform more user-friendly.

314,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/tests-begin-on-bones-that-may-be-revolutionary-war-soldiers/,"NORTH HAVEN, CONNECTICUT: A university laboratory began tests Friday on skeletal remains found beneath an 18th century home in the hopes of identifying the three people believed to be soldiers killed during the Revolutionary War.
In December, while homeowners were renovating their house in Ridgefield, the remains were discovered in a grave under the foundation.
“These bones are so robust, they’re dense, they’re thick with muscle attachments (and) they’re long,” said Nick Bellantoni, emeritus state archaeologist of the Connecticut Museum of Natural History. “Who exactly they are, we are hoping the forensic work will show.”
The skull of one of the skeletal remains found buried in underneath a home that dates back to 1790, sits in a computerized tomography (CT) scan machine at Quinnipiac University’s Center for Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, on Friday, January 3, 2020, in North Haven, Connecticut. Photo: AP
While much remains unknown, researchers believe the remains belonged to men and possibly date to the Battle of Ridgefield, which occurred in April 1777. The way the men were buried in a haphazard grave also lends credibility to the idea that they were victims of the Battle of Ridgefield.
“They’re actually laying on top of each other overlapped,” Bellantoni said.
If confirmed, Bellantoni said that would make them the first remains from a Revolutionary War soldier recovered in Connecticut.
Bellantoni said the medical examiner quickly suspected the bones were very old because older bones tend to have less organic matter and start to flake over time.

Copper buttons found with the remains could indicate they belonged to militiamen.
While researchers suspect they might be soldiers, they don’t know if they might be British or American.
The bones are being analyzed at Quinnipiac University’s Center for Medicine, Nursing and Health Science in North Haven.
Jaime Ullinger, director of anthropology at the university, said they are starting to conduct X-ray analysis on the bones to help examine parts of the skeleton that have deteriorated over time.
She said that, even before the remains are identified, researchers will be able to gather other kinds of information, such as what kind of diet the men had and more broadly where they might be from.
Tania Grgurich, clinical associate professor of diagnostic imaging at the university, said it is an important opportunity to learn about history and for staff and students to be up close with unusual remains.
“This is part of our history, potentially, and then these are human beings that are being unearthed,” she said. “It’s not that often that something like this happens.”

ROME: As water shortages, high temperatures and rising greenhouse gas emissions threaten food production, countries around the world are looking somewhere new for solutions – the soil.
For decades, farmers wanting to boost their yields have focused their attention on fertilisers, technology and new seed varieties.
Instead, they should be looking under their feet, according to experts, who warn that years of erosion and degradation of the soil through intensive farming have created the conditions for a global food production crisis.
“Data suggests that if we do not restore global soil health, it is highly likely the consequences within 10 years will be many, many millions facing food and water insecurity,” British soil expert John Crawford told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
This could lead to “civil unrest, mass migration, radicalisation and violence on an unprecedented scale,” said Crawford, until recently a science director at the world’s oldest agricultural research institute, Rothamsted Research.
Much of the problem is caused by erosion, which strips away the highly fertile top layer of soil. An area of soil the size of a soccer pitch is eroded every five seconds, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
While soil erosion occurs naturally, human activities such as intensive agriculture, deforestation and urban sprawl have significantly increased the rate at which it is happening.
Nearly a third of Earth’s soil is already degraded. At current rates, that will increase to 90% by 2050, the FAO forecasts, warning that pollution from human activity such as mining and manufacturing as well as erosion are to blame.
There are signs the world is beginning to wake up to the issue, which Crawford said it had only about 10 to 15 years to sort out.
Soil is “one of the most important regulators of global climate” because it stores more carbon than the planet’s atmosphere and vegetation combined, he said.
“If you fix soil, you mitigate a whole bunch of other risks,” added Crawford, now professor of technology and strategy at the Adam Smith Business School in Glasgow.
Whole Foods, the upscale US retailer that made its name selling organic food, has put “regenerative agriculture” – farming that focuses on soil health – at the top of its trends for 2020.
LOW-COST TESTING
From Iowa to the Ayeyarwady delta region of Myanmar – known as the country’s rice bowl – farmers are trying to figure out how to make their soil healthier and more productive.
In a remote village in the Ayeyarwady delta recently, a group of farmers sat cross-legged on a wooden floor and discussed why their once-thriving farms had become less productive.
The men had started testing their soil for the first time with the help of Proximity Designs, a business that designs low-cost farming products.
The company only began offering low-cost soil testing services in Myanmar in 2018 and by last October it had already sold more than 7,600 tests at $17 each, highlighting farmer interest.
“We didn’t have anyone to teach us (about soil). We followed suggestions from others, thinking they might work,” said Win Zaw, 44, who grows rice twice a year on his six-acre (2.4-hectare) farm.
“We knew something was wrong, but didn’t know what to do,” he said, looking down at neatly-typed sheets of paper detailing the levels of nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, acidity and organic matter in the soil.
All the farms were showing very low organic matter, which is produced by decomposing plants and is key to good soil health.
Proximity Designs’ agronomists said this was likely due partly to the warm climate, which degrades organic matter more quickly, and partly to local farming practices.
Their recommendations were relatively simple: leave crop residues after the harvest to retain the moisture in the soil, or sow cover crops – those planted to protect the soil between rice plantings rather than for commercial reasons.
When it came to fertiliser use, the recommended amount was much lower than what the farmers were using.
“Applying farming practices without knowing what’s happening in the soil can lead to crop failures, soil degradation, environmental damage and ecosystem breakdown,” said Proximity founder Debbie Aung Din.
‘ALLY OR ENEMY’
In Iowa, a state in the US Midwest known for its cornfields, farmers are increasingly seeking to improve soil health, said Richard Cruse, a professor at Iowa State University’s agronomy department.
“We see increasing numbers of cover crops that are being planted. We’re increasing the rate of no-till adoption,” he said, referring to a method of farming without tilling the soil that is said to reduce erosion.
“I’ve talked to several (farmers) in my area who are saying, ‘We have to do something different’.”
But many lack the expertise and skills, while farmers who rent say it is not worth investing in land that they do not own.
“In Iowa, more than half of the farmland is managed by farmers that don’t own the land,” said Cruse.
“I’ve had multiple farmers tell me, ‘conservation practices on land that I rent is a cost’.”
Ronald Vargas, land and water officer for the FAO and secretary of the Global Soils Partnership – a key player in pushing this issue – said farmers had to be given advice and incentives.
“Soil can be your ally or your enemy,” he said. “But in many countries, farmers are left alone. There is nobody advising them.”

316,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/century-old-tb-vaccine-may-work-better-if-given-in-a-new-way/,"WASHINGTON: Scientists think they’ve figured out how to make a century-old tuberculosis vaccine far more protective: Simply give the shot a different way.
In a study with monkeys, injecting the vaccine straight into the bloodstream dramatically improved its effectiveness over today’s skin-deep shot, researchers reported Wednesday.
“This offers hope,” although more safety studies are required before testing the approach in people, said Dr Robert Seder of the National Institutes of Health, a senior author of the study.
Tuberculosis kills about 1.7 million people a year, mostly in poor countries. The only vaccine, called the BCG vaccine, is used mainly in high-risk areas to protect babies from one form of the disease. But it’s far less effective at protecting teens and adults from the main threat, TB in the lungs.
Most vaccines are shots jabbed in the muscle or skin. Seder came up with the idea of IV immunization a few years ago, with experiments showing a malaria vaccine candidate worked better when injected into a vein. He wondered if the TB vaccine would react the same way.

Researchers at NIH teamed with the University of Pittsburgh to study certain monkeys, rhesus macaques, that react to TB infection much like people do. They tested a variety of ways to give the TB vaccine, including a mist that the monkeys inhaled through a mask.
Six months after the vaccinations, the researchers delivered TB bacteria straight into the animals’ lungs and watched for infection. Monkeys given today’s standard skin shot, even with a higher dose, were only slightly more protected than unvaccinated animals, and the mist wasn’t too effective, either.
But in 9 of 10 monkeys, a higher-than-usual vaccine dose injected into a vein worked much better, the researchers reported in the journal Nature. The team found no trace of infection in six of the animals and counted very low levels of TB bacteria in the lungs of three.
Why? The hypothesis is that key immune cells called T cells have to swarm the lungs to kill off TB bacteria and can do so more quickly when the vaccine is carried rapidly around the body via the bloodstream. Sure enough, tests showed more active T cells lingering in the lungs of monkeys vaccinated the new way.
The findings are striking, showing that how a vaccine is given “clearly affects immunity,” University of Massachusetts TB specialists Samuel Behar and Chris Sassetti, who weren’t involved in the study, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Still, giving a vaccine intravenously isn’t nearly as easy as other kinds of shots, they cautioned.
Seder said additional safety research is underway in animals, with hopes of beginning a first-step study in people in about 18 months.

317,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/india-approves-third-moon-mission-months-after-landing-failure/,"BENGALURU: India has approved its third lunar mission months after its last one failed to successfully land on the moon, its space agency said on Wednesday, the latest effort in its ambitions to become a low-cost space power.
The Chandrayaan-3 mission will have a lander and a rover, but not an orbiter, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman K Sivan told reporters at its headquarters in Bengaluru, according to an official telecast.
The Chandrayaan-2 mission in September successfully deployed a lunar orbiter that relays scientific data back to earth, but was unable to place a rover on the lunar surface after a “hard” landing.
That mission had aimed to land on the south pole of the moon, where no other lunar mission had gone before. The region is believed to contain water as craters in the region are largely unaffected by the high temperatures of the sun.
ISRO had hoped to confirm the presence of water in the form of ice, first detected on its mission in 2008.
Chandrayaan-3 will have a “similar configuration” as the previous mission, Sivan said.
Only the United States, Russia and China have landed on the moon. Beijing’s Chang’e-4 probe touched down on the far side of the moon last year, while Israel made an unsuccessful attempt to land its Beresheet spacecraft on the moon in April 2019.
India’s third lunar mission will likely launch in 2020 and will cost less than its previous mission, the PTI news agency reported on Tuesday, citing Jitendra Singh, junior minister for the department of space.
Sivan also said ISRO was making “good progress” for its human space-flight mission slated for late 2021, adding that four astronauts had been picked for training, which will be planned later this month. The project, called Gaganyaan, would cost less than 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion), the government said in 2018.
India has developed a reputation for pioneering affordable satellite launches and space missions. Its unmanned Mars mission in 2014 cost just $74 million, less than the budget of the Hollywood space blockbuster “Gravity”.
Sivan also announced that ISRO had begun the land acquisition process for a second spaceport in the southern port city of Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu state.

319,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/decade-in-review-what-the-smartphone-has-wrought/,"Dec 23: When the first Apple iPhone hit the market in 2007, not everyone was convinced it would supplant the flip-phone. When Google’s Android software system arrived a year later, the Blackberry still seemed to have bright future.
But with the iPhone 4 in 2010, featuring a high-resolution display, sleek design and front-facing camera, our collective fate was sealed. Here are 10 ways the smartphone has made its mark over the decade.
Access everywhere
Today some 5 billion smartphones are in use around the world, according to Canalys Research. The total number of internet subscriptions has soared to 7.2 billion globally from 1.3 billion in 2010, the vast majority of them mobile subscriptions, International Telecommunications Union data shows. The explosion in connectivity has been especially dramatic in the developing world, where there are now more mobile connections than people.
Tech uber alles
Apple Inc, once a niche computer company, is now one of the world’s most valuable companies thanks to the iPhone. The five largest Fortune 500 technology companies – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook – currently boast a market cap of $4.7 trillion, compared with about $800 billion for the top five in 2010. Not all of that is due to the smartphone, of course, but the mobile-related technologies and services accounted for nearly $4 trillion in economic activity in 2018, according to trade group GSMA.
There’s an app for that
Whether we’re hailing a cab, ordering food, playing a game, finding a date, listening to music or shopping for just about anything, there’s a good chance we’ll be doing it with a smartphone app that didn’t exist in 2010. Many of most popular apps are free, but consumers are still expected to spend more than $120 billion in app stores during 2019, according to App Annie, a mobile apps analytics firm.
Feed me
The endless scroll on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media apps now consumes 34 minutes of every U.S. adult’s day, according to Nielsen. Fewer people are sitting on the sofa to watch live TV at set times, and advertisers are following. Mobile ad spending surpassed TV for the first time in 2018 in terms of percentage share of the U.S. market, according to research firm eMarketer. We can also thank the smartphone for Instagram influencers, “sextortion,” and fake news.
Smile for the (smartphone) camera
Global shipments of digital cameras dropped from their 2010 peak of 121 million to just 19 million units in 2018, according to the Camera & Imaging Products Association (CIPA). Meantime the latest phones pack as many four camera lenses and cutting edge software that makes it easier than ever to get that perfect shot. The front-facing camera might be the busiest: Google reports that its Android devices take 93 million selfies every day.
Where am I?
The satellite tracking technology known as GPS, combined with information from cell towers and Wi-Fi networks, has made the smartphones incredibly powerful tracking devices. Google maps and its poorer cousins enable even the most directionally impaired find their way around unfamiliar locales with ease.
For the privacy-minded, though, it’s a disaster: Phone companies and app makers routinely record the movements of subscribers and sell that data to advertisers, a $20 billion-a-year business. The data is “anonymized,” but as numerous studies and a recent New York Times investigation have revealed it is often a simple matter to identify who is behind the dot on the map. Nearly 50% of companies surveyed by Verizon this year used or planned to soon use smartphone management tools to track their employees.
You can look it up
The 2010 edition of the venerable Encyclopedia Britannica, all 32 volumes and 129 pounds of it, turned out to be the last. But untold barroom arguments or dining room debates can now be settled on the spot: Wikipedia is consulted more than 240 million times daily.
Distracting ourselves to death
In 2018 alone in the United States, 2,628 fatal crashes involved a distracted driver, and of those deadly crashes, about 13% involved mobile phone use, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
Forget your wallet
Apple Pay and Google Pay are still afterthoughts for most U.S. consumers, but China may be a harbinger. Alipay and WeChat pay, China’s two big smartphone payment services, have reached a combined adoption rate of over 80% since they were launched around the beginning of the decade, according to a study by Bain. The QR code now peppers storefront windows. Even streetside beggars have adapted, sometimes rejecting cash and asking that payments be made via WeChat Pay or Alipay.
Say what?
Among the major casualties of the smartphone era is the conventional phone call itself: ubiquitous messaging apps have helped make video calls, GIFs, emojis and audio messaging preferred modes of communication. In the UK, for example, the total number of minutes spent on voice calls fell from 254 billion in 2013 to 206 billion in 2018, and the number of text messages dropped from 129 billion to 74 billion over the same period, according to Ofcom. Mobile data usage, meanwhile, jumped almost nine-fold between 2013 and 2018. The number of available emojis has nearly tripled to almost 3,000 since 2010.

320,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/bulls-eye-landing-caps-boeings-faulty-astronaut-capsule-test-mission/,"WASHINGTON: Boeing Co’s Starliner astronaut spacecraft made a “bull’s-eye” landing in the New Mexico desert on Sunday, a successful ending to a crewless test mission that two days earlier failed to reach the orbit needed to dock with the International Space Station.
The 7:58 am ET (1258 GMT) landing at the White Sands desert capped a turbulent 48 hours for Boeing’s botched milestone test of an astronaut capsule that is designed to help NASA regain its human spaceflight capabilities.
A software problem on Friday caused the capsule to fail to attain the orbit needed to rendezvous with the space station, another unwelcome engineering black eye for Boeing in a year that has seen corporate crisis over the grounding of its 737 MAX jetliner following two fatal crashes of the aircraft.

Officials from the aerospace company and NASA breathed sighs of relief following the landing, a highly challenging feat.
“Today it couldn’t really have gone any better,” Boeing space chief executive Jim Chilton told reporters on Sunday, adding that experts would need weeks to analyze the data from this mission before determining if Boeing could move forward with its plan to send a crewed mission on the craft in 2020.
The landing, which tested the capsule’s difficult reentry into the atmosphere and parachute deployment, will yield the mission’s most valuable test data after it failed to meet one of its core objectives of docking to the space station.
“We’re going to get I think a lot more data than we would have gotten if the test had gone according to plan,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said.
After Starliner’s touchdown, teams of engineers in trucks raced to inspect the vehicle, whose six airbags cushioned its impact on the desert surface as planned, a live video feed showed.
The spacecraft was in good condition after landing, Chilton said, with little charring and stable air pressure and temperature in the cabin.
The CST-100 Starliner’s debut launch to orbit was a milestone test for Boeing. The company is vying with SpaceX, the privately held rocket company of billionaire high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, to revive NASA’s human spaceflight capabilities. SpaceX carried out a successful unmanned flight of its Crew Dragon capsule to the space station in March.
After the Starliner capsule was launched from Florida on Friday, an automated timer error prevented it from attaining the right orbit to meet and dock with the space station. Chilton said the timer was running 11 hours ahead, which caused the spacecraft to burn fuel too quickly.

PARACHUTE CHALLENGE
Starliner’s three main parachutes deployed just over one mile (1,600 metres) from the Earth’s surface on Sunday after enduring intense heat from the violent reentry through the atmosphere, plummeting at 25 times the speed of sound.
The parachute deployment, one of the most challenging procedures under the program to develop a commercial manned space capsule, earned Boeing a win after a previous mishap where one parachute failed to deploy during a November test of Starliner’s abort thrusters.
That test tossed the capsule miles into the sky to demonstrate its ability to land a crew safely back on the ground in the event of a launch failure.
For the current mission, Boeing and NASA officials said they still do not understand why software caused the craft to miss the orbit required.
Sunday’s landing marked the first time a US orbital space capsule designed for humans landed on land.
All past US capsules, including SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, splashed down in the ocean. Russia’s Soyuz capsules and China’s past crew capsules made land landings.
The now-retired Space Shuttle used to glide in like a massive plane.

321,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/twitter-facebook-ban-fake-users-some-had-ai-created-photos/,"NEW YORK: Twitter has identified and removed nearly 6,000 accounts that it said were part of a coordinated effort by Saudi government agencies and individuals to advance the country’s geopolitical interests.
Separately, Facebook said it removed hundreds of Facebook accounts, groups and pages linked to inauthentic behaviour from two separate groups, one originating in the country of Georgia and one in  Vietnam, which targeted people both in Vietnam and in the US
Facebook said some of the accounts used profile photos generated by artificial intelligence and masqueraded as Americans. It is one of the first such misinformation efforts to use material generated by AI.
Tech companies have stepped up efforts to tackle misinformation on their services ahead of next year’s US presidential elections. The efforts followed revelations that Russians bankrolled thousands of fake political ads during the 2016 elections to sow dissent among Americans.
Twitter’s and Facebook’s announcements underscore the fact that misinformation concerns aren’t limited to the US and Russia.
In a blog post-Friday, Twitter said the removed Saudi accounts were amplifying messages favourable to Saudi authorities, mainly through “aggressive liking, retweeting and replying.” While the majority of the content was in Arabic, Twitter said the tweets also amplified discussions about sanctions in Iran and appearances by Saudi government officials in Western media.
“Governments have started to launch influence campaigns the same ways commercial enterprises launch campaigns to sell detergent or cars,” said James Ludes, a national defence expert who teaches international relations and public policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.
He said the Russian efforts in 2016 showed it was possible to “actually change public attitudes through the targeted use of social media.”
While the attempts to root out the campaigns may seem like a game of whack-a-mole, he said companies have at least shown progress in taking steps to identify and root out manipulation campaigns run by foreign powers.
Twitter began archiving tweets and media it deems to be associated with known state-backed information operations in 2018. It shut 200,000 Chinese accounts that targeted Hong Kong protests in August.
The 5,929 accounts removed and added to the archives are part of a larger group of 88,000 accounts engaged in “spammy behaviour” across a wide range of topics. But Twitter isn’t disclosing all of them because some might be legitimate accounts taken over through hacking.
The Twitter accounts were linked to a social media marketing firm in Saudi Arabia called Smaat that managed many government departments in Saudi Arabia. The accounts used third-party automated tools to amplify non-political content at high volumes. Twitter said that activity was used to mask the political manoeuvrings of the same accounts.
Samuel Woolley, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies disinformation, said that while the Saudi campaign used basic manipulation techniques, including the use of likes and retweets to give the illusion of popularity, the campaign’s size and scale were unusual. The existence of a thousands-strong army of Saudi accounts also show that social media companies still don’t have a good solution, he said, despite the progress, they have made at identifying state-backed accounts.
“It’s really clear we have to do something about it,” he said. “It can’t just be after the fact. We have to get better about detecting in real-time.”
Messages left with Saudi officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the country’s embassy in Washington was not immediately returned.
The Saudi government has used different tactics to control speech and keep reformers and others from organizing, including employing troll armies to harass and intimidate users online. It has also arrested and imprisoned Twitter users.
In September, Twitter suspended the account of the crown prince’s former top adviser, Saud al-Qahtani, who also served as director of the cybersecurity federation. As with Friday’s announcement, Twitter said that account had violated the company’s platform manipulation policy.
Last month, two former Twitter employees were charged with acting as agents of Saudi Arabia without registering with the US government. The complaint details a coordinated effort by Saudi government officials to recruit employees at the social media giant to look up the private data of Twitter accounts, including email addresses linked to the accounts and internet protocol addresses that can give up a user’s location.
In terms of Facebook’s actions, Facebook said the Georgia group targeted domestic audiences and the Vietnam group focused mainly in the US, as well as Vietnamese-, Spanish- and Chinese-speaking audiences around the world.
The company said they created networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing. To evade detection, they used a combination of fake and real accounts of people in the US to manage pages and groups, the company said.
“We are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we’ve said before, it’s an ongoing challenge,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security policy, said in a blog post.

PARIS: France’s competition authority fined Google 150 million euros ($167 million) for anti-competitive behaviour and for having unclear advertising on the Google Ads page.
The fine comes as France and other European countries maintain high levels of scrutiny on major US tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, which are often criticised for having relatively low tax payments.
In September, Google agreed to pay close to 1 billion euros to French authorities to settle a fiscal fraud probe that began four years ago.
Google, which is the world’s biggest internet search engine, has also faced growing regulatory scrutiny about the content it promotes in search results and ads.
Isabelle de Silva, head of the French competition authority, told news conference that Google’s dominance in the online advertising business was “extraordinary”, with the US company having a market share of around 90% in that field.
Google said it would appeal the fine.
In January, France’s data protection watchdog had fined Google 50 million euros for breaching European Union online privacy rules.
The French watchdog stated in that January ruling that Google lacked transparency and clarity in the way it informed users about its handling of personal data, and had failed to properly obtain their consent for personalised ads.

323,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/scientists-narrow-age-estimate-for-fossils-of-human-ancestor/,"NEW YORK: Scientists say they have finally calculated the age of the youngest known remains of Homo erectus, which is generally considered an ancestor of our species.
The fossilised skull fragments and other bones were uncovered on the Indonesian island of Java in the 1930s. Determining their age has been a scientific challenge, and a wide range has been proposed by numerous studies.


In a report released Wednesday by the journal Nature, scientists conclude the remains are between 108,000 and 117,000 years old. Researchers used five dating techniques on sediments and fossil animal bones from the area, combining 52 age estimates for the analysis. The project took 13 years to complete.
“I don’t see any way to date this site more thoroughly,” said paleoanthropologist Russell Ciochon of the University of Iowa, an author of the study.
H. erectus arose in Africa about 2 million years ago and spread widely there and in Asia, and possibly into Europe. It reached Java more than 1.5 million years ago, and the new dates suggest it died out at least 35,000 years before the arrival there of our own species, Homo sapiens.
H. erectus may have been doomed on Java by climate change that turned its open woodland environment into rain forest, Ciochon said. Still, it evidently existed longer on Earth than any other species on our “Homo” branch of the evolutionary tree.
Susan Anton, a New York University anthropologist who did not participate in the work, called the dating effort “heroic.” But she said she considered the reported age range to be too narrow. She said she preferred a span of less than 550,000 years old to more than 100,000 years old.
That’s roughly what she and co-authors proposed in a paper published in 2011. The younger end of the range in that paper was as recent as 120,000 years, which she said is virtually the same as the new result.

Danish scientists have managed to extract a complete human DNA sample from a piece of birch pitch more than 5,000 years old, used as a kind of chewing gum, a study revealed yesterday.
The Stone-Age sample yielded enough information to determine the source’s sex, what she had last eaten and the germs in her mouth. It also told them she probably had dark hair, dark skin and blue eyes.

And genetically, she was more closely related to hunter-gatherers from the mainland Europe than to those living in central Scandinavia at the time, they concluded.
“It is the first time that an entire ancient human genome has been extracted from anything other than human bones,” Hannes Schroeder of the University of Copenhagen, told AFP.
Schroeder is co-author of the study, which was published in the review Nature Communications.
They found the sample during an archaeological dig at Syltholm, in southern Denmark, said Tehis Jensen, one of the other authors.
“Syltholm is completely unique,” he said.
“Almost everything is sealed in mud, which means that the preservation of organic remains is absolutely phenomenal.”
The researchers also recovered traces of plant and animal DNA — hazelnut and duck — confirming what archaeologists already know about the people who lived there at the time.
But they were not sure why their subject chose to chew the bark: whether to turn it into a kind of glue, to clean her teeth, to stave off hunger — or simply as chewing gum.

In the labs of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a research unit of Columbia University overlooking the Hudson River, the scientists led by Professor Braddock Linsley pore over feet-long coral cores they extracted from far-away reefs.
For Linsley and his colleagues, corals are a precious repository of clues about the past that may help predict future climate trends. They can also reveal how much and how fast environmental conditions have changed during a certain period of time.
Cores are the hard, stony part of a coral underneath the top of the colony – its skeleton. Much like trees, corals produce growth rings that record climatic conditions like seawater temperatures and rainfall as they grow.
In a lab room packed with boxes of coral samples, Linsley and a small team of colleagues cut the cores into slabs and then X-ray the slabs to reveal the annual growth bands.
Using dentist drills, they pulverize small pieces and run geochemical analyses of the coral dust to reconstruct changes in the temperature, salinity and acidity of the water around the coral on a monthly basis going back hundreds of years.
“It is years of lab work and a lot of frustration but once you get to that point, the final product is just so exciting because you’ve got this long dataset,” Linsley said.
Coral reefs develop over thousands of years and are vital to the survival and prosperity of countless marine species. They also curtail flood damage from storms and support human activities like fisheries.
As humans burn more fossil fuel – the biggest contributor to global warming – oceans absorb growing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2).
Some of Linsley’s recent research on corals from the South Pacific island of Tonga suggests that increased seawater acidification caused by excess CO2 could lead to a decline in coral growth rates, endangering the wellbeing of entire reefs.

LOVE AT FIRST CHANCE
Linsley, a tall and soft-spoken 60-year-old, grew up on the Connecticut coast, making dams in the sand and observing erosion on the beaches near the town of Guilford. He loved water and began his career studying ocean sediments and fossils.
His work on corals began after a chance encounter with a colleague who was visiting his girlfriend at the University of New Mexico – where Linsley was studying to get his PhD in the late 1980s – led to a collaboration.
“I was fascinated by the fact that the corals had these annual bands in them and you could potentially extract annual resolve records back several hundred years,” he said at his office in the leafy campus, papers and books scattered on his desk and photos of diving expeditions on the wall.
Corals also brought him closer to the water and he had to learn how to dive, a perk of the job for Linsley.
By studying the environmental records derived from corals, the scientist is hoping to be able to shine a light on issues like the rate of surface ocean warming, ocean acidification and the impact on coral reef ecosystems worldwide.
But one thing is already evident, he said. Environmental changes are happening much more rapidly than in the last several thousand years and they are “clearly linked” to human activity.
Linsley’s childhood home in Connecticut – which he said now regularly battles encroaching waters – stood as a stark reminder.
“My children are 11 and 13. I think about in 50 years from now when I’m not here, what’s it going to be like,” he said.

326,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/remote-island-off-east-timor-turns-sunlight-air-into-drinking-water/,"KUALA LUMPUR: Villagers on a tiny island off the coast of East Timor who have long struggled with water shortages have secured regular fresh supplies, using just air and the power of the sun.
The innovative scheme uses solar power to suck water out of the air and make it drinkable, with the aim of reducing plastic waste and providing the small community on the wildlife-rich island of Atauro with a renewable supply of drinking water.
“The people living on Atauro have not had the opportunity to drink clean water that is not packaged in plastic,” said Rob Bartrop, chief revenue officer at Zero Mass Water the US technology firm behind the scheme.
“For the first time … they have a renewable source of water they can rely on,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Population growth and climate change are putting increasingly intense pressure on the planet’s limited water supplies, with worsening shortages emerging from the Middle East to Asia and Latin America, researchers said last month.
Like many similar islands in the region, Atauro lacks water infrastructure, leaving its 10,000 inhabitants reliant on rainwater and bottled supplies shipped in to meet their needs.
The new project, run with the US non-profit Conservation International, began operating in June and uses a material to absorb or suck water out of the air which is then turned into clean water.
In addition to reducing Atauro’s plastic water bottle waste, the project produces 12,000 litres of drinking water per month.
Zero Mass Water’s technology is now being used in schools, homes and businesses more than 35 countries, but the Atauro project is one of the first to be designed to serve an entire community’s drinking needs.
“We hope that there is a lot of scope to replicate and expand in surrounding parts of the region,” said Bartrop.

327,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/holidays-bring-phishing-scam-surge-aimed-at-small-business/,"NEW YORK: The email looked legitimate, so Danielle Radin clicked on the link it contained, expecting to have her products included in a holiday gift guide.
“I instantly regretted it,” says Radin, owner of Mantra Magnets, a website that sells wellness products. “It took me to some random website that looked like those pop-ups telling you that you’ve won the lottery.”
Within days of that click three weeks ago, Radin began getting notifications that people in Ecuador, China and elsewhere were trying to access her email account. She wasn’t surprised; she knew her San Diego-based small business had been the target of a phishing scam.
While cybercriminals strike at any time of the year, they’re particularly active during the holiday and income tax filing seasons when computer users expect to see more emails — and scammers are increasingly targeting individual small businesses with phishing scams, sending messages that look legitimate but do harm instead. An unsuspecting owner or employee clicks on a link or attachment and like Radin finds that malicious software has invaded their PCs.
Cybersecurity experts find that criminals who used to blanket thousands of computer users in hopes of fooling a handful have refined their methods. Scammers find small businesses through websites, social media sites and by combing email address books. They also mine personal data from breaches at retailers and other large companies. Then, using a process called social engineering, they construct emails that increasingly look realistic, as if they truly come from a boss, colleague, friend, potential client or vendor, a bank and even the IRS.
“In the last year or two they’ve been running more professional campaigns,” says Perry Toone, owner of Thexyz, an email service provider based in Toronto. “It can take a couple of minutes for me to determine that they’re phishing scams. That tells me they’re doing a very good job.”
Radin believes the scammers found her through her website or a blog. Like many small businesses, she has an email address on her site, and the scammers figured out that she might be interested in selling via a holiday gift guide. But finding a target is one thing; the scam won’t work unless it tricks an email recipient into clicking. Even those who are tech savvy can sometimes let their guard down. Radin was duped even though she’s the author of “Everyone’s Been Hacked,” a book sold online.
Often a scam succeeds because there’s just a shred of doubt in a computer user — the email is realistic enough that an owner or employee feels they need to read it. Sometimes a staffer clicks out of fear or a sense of responsibility, says Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College.
“It might not sound very personal, but you have an idea that you should go ahead — you feel like the email is coming from the boss,” he says.
Computer users may not be looking as closely as they should at an email — there can be subtle signs that a message is trouble. Terry Cole, owner of Cole Informatics, a company whose work includes cybersecurity, recalls getting an email that truly seemed to be from a colleague. He was one of several people in the industry to receive it.
“It said that this colleague had sent me a secure private message that was ready for me to read and included a link to click. This was absolutely consistent with my normal experiences communicating with him,” says Cole, whose company is located in Parsons, Tennessee.
Cole didn’t do in that instance what he usually does and advises everyone to do: check the email address to be sure it’s completely correct. When he clicked on the link, it took him to a bogus website claiming to be connected with Microsoft and asking him for his ID and password. He went no further and suffered no damage to his PC.
The holidays provide scammers with extra opportunities: emailed greeting cards, package shipment notices, offers of discounts — all of them false. Cybercriminals also seek personal information from owners and employees under the guise of needing them to create a W-2 or 1099 tax form; at this time of year, business owners’ thoughts are turning to taxes.
“Something that claims to know you, your name, where you work and wants you to take some action is harder to spot,” says Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company based in Sunnyvale, California.
A common scam at holiday time is an email purportedly from the boss telling a staffer to go buy gift cards and email the numbers back, DeGrippo says.
“When it appears to come from a boss or CEO, I think there is that tendency among employees to follow those directions. They’re playing on their emotions,” she says.
Often, a scam succeeds in getting an employee to click on a personal email while on a company PC — many workers check their personal email while at work. Even though the email came through on a personal message, it’s the company’s machine that can be infected.
Companies can protect themselves in part by restricting employees’ access to personal email sites, Telang says. He also suggests seminars to help staffers understand the risks that even legitimate-looking emails can present.
Some of the scams aim at monitoring a user’s keystrokes. So anyone accessing a company or personal account of any sort can be giving a criminal access to their money or sensitive personal data. One tool to prevent a bank account from being emptied or a credit card maxed out is to have accounts with multifactor authentication; that requires a password and a separate code sent to a different device and that is different for each login.

328,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-co-founders-step-aside-as-pichai-takes-helm-of-parent-alphabet/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google co–founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping aside as leaders of the Internet behemoth they founded 21 years ago, ending an extraordinary run that saw them build one of the world’s most valuable and influential companies.
Trusted lieutenant Sundar Pichai, who has run the core Google search business since 2015, will immediately take the reins as CEO of parent Alphabet Inc.
“While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it’s time to assume the role of proud parents — offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!” Page and Brin wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.
Page, Brin and Pichai have shared an emphasis on developing artificial intelligence software to make web searching faster and more personalised, while expanding the range of information and services available from a simple text query.
But their vision faces unprecedented scrutiny, with governments on five continents demanding better safeguards, an end to what many view as anticompetitive conduct, and more taxes from the world’s largest online advertising company. Thousands of employees have protested, and some have even resigned, over ongoing concern that Google‘s famous “don’t be evil” mantra – once embraced by Page and Brin – may be cracking.
Streamlining Alphabet‘s unorthodox management structure could help the company better respond to the challenges and focus on growing profits, investors said.
“This signals a shift away from the more fringy efforts … and more towards a company focused on technology that makes money,” said Kim Caughey Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
Alphabet, which owns more than a dozen companies including self-driving car business Waymo and health care software company Verily, was created in 2015 as part of a restructuring. The Google unit retained control of major businesses including video giant YouTube, the Android smartphone software and hardware operations, and cloud computing.
Page had wanted to focus on developing the newer businesses, which collectively lose money. He left Google, by far the biggest and most profitable part of Alphabet, to Pichai, who in turn delegates a lot of authority to deputies who manage the various product lines. Brin had stayed on as Alphabet‘s president, spending time on robotics, health ventures and other research projects.
But Page and Brin, once regular sights at public events and at Google headquarters, had become much less visible in recent years. Page’s retreat into the background drew increasing criticism from employees and US lawmakers, who demanded answers from him rather than Pichai about controversial projects such as an experimental search app for Chinese users.
Page and Brin, both 46, remain directors of the parent company but will cede their respective CEO and president titles immediately, Alphabet said. The president role will not be filled, it said, describing the changes as long discussed.
Page’s voice has been impaired for years because of a chronic condition, but his health did not play a role in the decision to step aside, Alphabet said.
“With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it’s the natural time to simplify our management structure,” the co–founders said. “We are deeply committed to Google and Alphabet for the long term.”
The co–founders still control the company through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26.1% of Alphabet‘s total voting power, Brin 25.25% and Pichai less than 1%. Alphabet shares rose 0.56% following the after-hours announcement to $1,302.
‘MOONSHOTS’ AND REGULATORS
Page and Brin developed the core Google search technology while they were still graduate students at Stanford, and it quickly proved far superior to competing search engines of the early Internet era.
By the time it went public in 2004, Google dominated Web search and was on its way to becoming a household name and the most powerful force in the global advertising business. The young co–founders also nurtured a free-wheeling, engineering-driven culture that became a model in Silicon Valley, which is littered with startups launched by Google veterans.
Pichai, 47, who has spent 15 years at Google, rose to prominence while leading the development of Google‘s Chrome browser. He later led product development and engineering across all of Google‘s services for a year before gaining the CEO title.
Page and Brin are active in a range of non-Google ventures. Page funded a company attempting to develop flying cars, and Brin at a conference last year discussed a budding interest in cryptocurrency. The Alphabet structure was designed in part to let them pursue new “moonshot” projects.
Investors and regulators, however, were never completely sold.
Alphabet had used the separation between Page’s and Pichai‘s roles to defend its limited financial disclosures about YouTube and other large Google businesses when the practice was questioned by US securities regulators in 2017.
It contended that publicly reported financial results were in line with what Page reviewed as Alphabet CEO. Regulators did not take further action, but the company’s stance has frustrated investors trying to evaluate its performance.
Alphabet declined to comment on whether public financial reporting would change with Pichai assuming both CEO positions.

329,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/for-babies-born-with-hiv-start-treatment-right-away-study/,"WASHINGTON: When babies are born with HIV, starting treatment within hours to days is better than waiting even the few weeks to months that’s the norm in many countries, researchers reported Wednesday.
The findings, from a small but unique study in Botswana, could influence care in Africa and other regions hit hard by the virus. They also might offer a clue in scientists’ quest for a cure.
The Harvard-led team found super early treatment limits how HIV takes root in a newborn’s body, shrinking the “reservoir” of virus that hides out, ready to rebound if those youngsters ever stop their medications.
“We don’t think the current intervention is itself curative, but it sets the stage” for future attempts, said Dr Daniel Kuritzkes of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who co-authored the study.
Giving pregnant women a cocktail of anti-HIV drugs can prevent them from spreading the virus to their unborn children, a step that has dramatically reduced the number of babies born with the virus worldwide. Still, some 300 to 500 infants are estimated to be infected every day in sub-Saharan Africa.
Doctors have long known that treating babies in the first weeks to months of life is important, because their developing immune systems are especially vulnerable to HIV. But an infant dubbed the “Mississippi baby” raised a critical question: Should treatment start even earlier? The girl received a three-drug combination within 30 hours of her birth in July 2010, highly unusual for the time. Her family quit treatment when she was a toddler — yet her HIV remained in remission for a remarkable 27 months before she relapsed and restarted therapy.
The Botswana study was one of several funded by the US National Institutes of Health after doctors learned of the Mississippi baby, to further explore very early treatment.
The findings are encouraging, said Dr Deborah Persaud, a pediatric HIV specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the Botswana study but helped evaluate the Mississippi baby.
“The study showed what we hypothesized happened in the Mississippi baby, that very early treatment really prevents establishment of these long-lived reservoir cells that currently are the barrier to HIV eradication,” Persaud said.
She cautioned: “Very early treatment is important, but prevention should still be our top priority.”
In Botswana, researchers tested at-risk newborns, enrolling 40 born with HIV, treating them within hours to a few days, and tracking them for two years. On Wednesday, they reported results from the first 10 patients, comparing them with 10 infants getting regular care — treatment beginning when they were a few months old.
Medication brought HIV under control in both groups. But the children treated earliest had a much smaller reservoir of HIV in their blood, starting about six months into treatment, the researchers reported in Science Translational Medicine.
The earliest-treated children also got another benefit: more normal functioning of some key parts of the immune system.
One big question: Did the HIV reservoir shrink enough to make a long-term difference? To find out, next year the researchers will give these children experimental antibodies designed to help keep HIV in check, and test how they fare with a temporary stop to their anti-HIV drugs.
In the US, Europe and South Africa, it’s becoming common to test at-risk infants at birth. But in most lower-income countries, babies aren’t tested until they’re 4 to 6 weeks old, said study co-author Dr. Roger Shapiro, a Harvard infectious disease specialist.

330,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/web-inventor-has-an-ambitious-plan-to-take-back-the-net/,"World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee released an ambitious rule book for online governance — a bill of rights and obligations for the internet — designed to counteract the growing prevalence of such anti-democratic poisons as misinformation, mass surveillance and censorship.
The product of a year’s work by the World Wide Web Foundation where Berners-Lee is a founding director, the “ Contract for the Web ” seeks commitments from governments and industry to make and keep knowledge freely available — a digital policy agenda true to the design vision of the 30-year-old web.
The contract is non-binding, however. And funders and partners in the endeavour include Google and Facebook, whose data-collecting business models and sensation-rewarding algorithms have been blamed for exacerbating online toxicity.
“We haven’t had a fairly complex, fairly complete plan of action for the web going forward,” Berners-Lee said in an interview. “This is the first time we’ve had a rule book in which responsibility is being shared.”
For instance, the contract proposes a framework for protecting online privacy and personal data with clearly defined national laws that give individuals greater control over the data collected about them. Independent, well-resourced regulators would offer the public effective means for redress. Current laws and institutions don’t measure up to that standard.
Amnesty International just released a report charging that Google and Facebook’s business models are predicated on the abuse of human rights.
Berners-Lee nevertheless says that “having them in the room is really important.” He said both companies had approached the foundation seeking participation.
“We feel that companies and governments deserve equal seats at the table and understanding where they’re coming from is equally valuable,” he said. “To have this conversation around a table without the tech companies, it just wouldn’t have the clout and we wouldn’t have ended up with the insights.”
The nonprofit foundation’s top donors include the Swedish, Canadian and US governments and the Ford and Omidyar foundations.
One of its biggest challenges is the growing balkanization of the internet, with national governments led by China, Russia and Iran exerting increasing technical control over their domestic networks, tightening censorship and surveillance.
“The trend for balkanization is really worrying and it’s extreme at the moment in Iran,” said Berners-Lee. A strong government exhibits tolerance, the computer scientist added, for “other voices, opposition voices, foreign voices to be heard by its citizens.”
So how to prevent governments from restricting internet access at their borders?
One approach, said Berners-Lee, could be financial pressure. Multinational lenders could condition lower interest rates, for example, on a nation’s willingness to let information flow freely on its domestic network.

331,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-reins-in-political-advertising/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google is making it harder for political advertisers to target specific types of people.
The company said that as of January, advertisers will only be able to target US political ads based on broad categories such as gender, age and postal code. Currently, ads can be tailored for more specific groups — for instance, using information gleaned from public voter logs, such as political affiliation.
The change will take effect in the UK in the next week, before the general election, and in the European Union before the end of 2019. It will apply everywhere else in early January.
Google reiterated that ads making false claims are prohibited, adding that so-called deepfakes — realistic but false video clips — are not allowed. Neither are “demonstrably false” claims that could affect voter trust in an election.
But in a blog post announcing the news, Google Ads vice president Scott Spencer noted that political dialogue is important and “no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim and insinuation.”
“So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited — but we will continue to do so for clear violations,” he wrote.
Like all Google ads, political advertisers can also use the broader practice of “contextual targeting,” which involves placing ads about, say, climate change on articles about the environment.
The company is also requiring advertiser verification for a broader range of political messages. Previously, only ads mentioning candidates or officeholders for federal positions required verification. Now that will also include ads touching on state officials and candidates as well as ballot measures.
The move follows Twitter’s ban on political ads, which goes into effect on Friday.
Twitter also placed restrictions on ads related to social causes such as climate change or abortion.
In these instances, advertisers won’t be able to target those ads down to a user’s ZIP code or use political categories such as “conservative” or “liberal.” Rather, targeting must be kept broad, based on a user’s state or province, for instance.
Facebook has not made sweeping changes to any of its ads policies, but thrust the issue into public discussion this fall when it confirmed it would not remove false or misleading ads by politicians.
Critics have harshly condemned Facebook’s decision. Twitter also faced a backlash from those who found its ban too far-reaching.
Google has taken a more middling stance, but it’s unlikely to please everyone. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s campaign staff took issue with reports that Facebook might consider limiting its targeting practices.
“Facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020,” the campaign tweeted from its official account. “Tools that help us reach more great Americans & lift voices the media & big tech choose to ignore!”
Even Google’s limited targeting could receive backlash.
Critics and civil rights groups have said targeting specific zip codes or other small geographic zones can allow advertisers to discriminate or sway elections.
The expansion to Google’s verification process will take effect December 3.

332,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/amazon-says-its-considered-face-scanning-in-ring-doorbells/,"Amazon has considered adding facial recognition technology to its Ring doorbell cameras, according to a letter to a US senator defending its video-sharing partnerships with police.
The company told Senator Ed Markey that facial recognition is a “contemplated, but unreleased feature” of its home security cameras but that there are no plans to coordinate that feature with its law enforcement partnerships.
Markey wrote to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in September raising privacy and civil liberty concerns about Ring’s video-sharing agreements with police departments across the country. The company encourages police to tap into Ring’s Neighbors app, a forum for residents to share videos of suspicious activity captured by their home security cameras.

The Massachusetts Democrat also expressed alarm that Ring may be pursuing face-scanning technology after a patent application showed the company is exploring a system that could flag certain people as suspicious and automatically alert police.
Markey released Amazon’s responses Tuesday.
Amazon’s initial response to Markey said Ring doesn’t currently offer facial recognition. Then Markey sent another letter to Bezos asking why it’s mentioned in Ring’s privacy policy. In a Nov. 1 follow-up, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, Brian Huseman, said that the company frequently innovates based on customer demand and that facial recognition is an increasingly common feature in cameras made by competitors such as Google’s Nest division.
“If our customers want these features in Ring security cameras, we will only release these features with thoughtful design including privacy, security, and user control,” Huseman wrote.
Markey’s questions about facial recognition were part of broader concerns that some lawmakers and civil liberties advocates have about Ring and its police partnerships. Amazon sought to address those concerns in its letters to Markey, emphasizing that camera owners have a choice about whether to share videos. The company noted that police aren’t allowed to seek recordings that are longer than 12 hours in duration or that cover a geographical area that is too specific or broad.
But Amazon also said it doesn’t require law enforcement to delete a user’s video footage after a certain period. Nor would it entertain Markey’s request that it commit to never selling users’ biometric information, saying only that it doesn’t do so now.
Markey said Tuesday that Amazon is not doing enough to ensure that its products don’t run afoul of civil liberties.
“Connected doorbells are well on their way to becoming a mainstay of American households, and the lack of privacy and civil rights protections for innocent residents is nothing short of chilling,” he said in a statement.
“If you’re an adult walking your dog or a child playing on the sidewalk, you shouldn’t have to worry that Ring’s products are amassing footage of you and that law enforcement may hold that footage indefinitely or share that footage with any third parties,” he added.
More than 600 police departments have signed up to Ring’s network since last year and many say it is becoming a useful crime-fighting tool. Among them is the police chief of Markey’s hometown of Malden, Massachusetts. Chief Kevin Molis said he is Markey’s neighbor and has known him since the 1970s but disagrees with him about Ring.
“We consider it a valuable tool for public safety,” Molis said in an interview. “Is it a bad thing that private citizens, in order to make their streets safer, are investing their own money in a product that’s allowing crimes to be solved and crimes to be prevented?”
But staff attorney Mohammad Tajsar of the ACLU of Southern California said Amazon’s responses to Markey raise grave privacy concerns. Amazon told Markey it has no way of knowing if its cameras are collecting personal data from children or positioned in such a way that they’re intruding on a neighbor’s privacy.
“Even if you don’t sell data, or provide data to law enforcement, you’re creating a mechanism whereby people can express latent biases and racism and classism in a portal that encourages it,” Tajsar said.

The demonstration of hovering, obstacle avoidance and deceleration capabilities was conducted at a site outside Beijing simulating conditions on the Red Planet, where the pull of gravity is about one-third that of Earth.
China plans to launch a lander and rover to Mars next year to explore parts of the planet in detail.
China’s burgeoning space program achieved a lunar milestone earlier this year by landing a probe on the mysterious far side of the moon.

It has developed rapidly, especially since it conducted its first crewed mission in 2003 and has sought cooperation with space agencies from Europe and elsewhere.
The US, however, has banned most space cooperation with China out of national security concerns, keeping China from participating in the International Space Station.
Despite that, China’s ambitions continue to grow as it seeks to rival the US, Russia and Europe in space and cement its position as a regional and global power.
Guests at Thursday’s event came from 19 countries and included the ambassadors of Brazil, France and Italy.
“This event is the first public appearance of China’s Mars exploration mission, also an important measure for China to pragmatically carry out space international exchanges and cooperation,” the China National Space Administration said in a news release.

LONDON: From tagging photos on Facebook to driving with Google Maps, people should join forces in “data unions” to demand payment for letting online tools collect their data, according to an economist advocating for radical reforms to improve society.
Glen Weyl, a principal researcher at the research arm of US tech giant Microsoft, said people have been “fooled” into handing over data that is then used in artificial intelligence (AI) to copy human behaviour and possibly eliminate some jobs.
“Humans are doing all this work and then we are being told that we are doing nothing, that we play no role, and that these systems are just going to automate us away. This is profoundly dishonest,” Weyl told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“We need to respect the fact that those data are actually being created by the very people who these companies are claiming are no longer relevant. And we need to acknowledge that by compensating them.”
While getting paid for tagging photos on Instagram or uploading to YouTube might sound way off, the idea has been gaining some traction in the United States as tech giants from Google, to Facebook and Twitter, face increased scrutiny over the way they handle personal information.
Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang has said people should receive a share of the economic value generated from their data, while the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, recently proposed companies should pay a “data dividend”.
Weyl said the amount people would get is a matter of debate but it would, in general, depend on the size of the economy that becomes automated, with people getting more money the more jobs are taken over by artificial intelligence thanks to their data.
Estimates vary from $500 a year in a present-day scenario, to $20,000 some 15 years down the line, when some projections say a third of all jobs will be done by computers, he said.
Yet, single users are unlikely to get a penny unless they organise in “data unions” similarly to what workers did during the industrial revolution, said Weyl, a speaker at the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s annual Trust Conference on Thursday.
“People get paid for completing surveys, or putting television boxes in their home that monitor how they watch television,” he said.
“The problem is that the ability of people to receive reasonable and fair compensation for what they do online is undermined by the fact that all these other people are consenting to do it for free.”
Unions could bring together users with specific sets of data, like on travel or shopping habits, and bargain a better price for it, said Weyl, who co-authored the 2018 book “Radical Markets” with legal scholar Eric Posner.
They could also help address privacy concerns by restricting what information is collected and how it is used, he added.
Some early versions of data unions already exist.
US start-up Datacoup offers users a platform to monetise their data, while Dutch group ‘Datavakbond’, or “data labour union”, was set up in 2018 with the aim of negotiating directly with Facebook and Google over data use.
But Weyl said more people needed to get involved or become vocal about the need for a more equitable system otherwise things could slide in the opposite direction, with a few powerful companies and central states controlling most data.
“We can build alternatives to the worst scenarios but those alternatives are not going to come unless we do it together,” he said.

That means “sky” in the language of the Native American Powhatan people, NASA said Tuesday.

NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew past the snowman-shaped Arrokoth on New Year’s Day, 3 ½ years after exploring Pluto. At the time, this small icy world 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometres) beyond Pluto was nicknamed Ultima Thule given its vast distance from us.
“The name ‘Arrokoth’ reflects the inspiration of looking to the skies,” lead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said in a statement, “and wondering about the stars and worlds beyond our own.”
The name was picked because of the Powhatan’s ties to the Chesapeake Bay region.
New Horizons is operated from Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland. The Hubble Space Telescope — which discovered Arrokoth in 2014 — has its science operations in Baltimore.
The New Horizons team got consent for the name from Powhatan Tribal elders and representatives, according to NASA. The International Astronomical Union and its Minor Planet Center approved the choice.
Arrokoth is among countless objects in the so-called Kuiper Belt, or vast Twilight Zone beyond the orbit of Neptune. New Horizons will observe some of these objects from afar as it makes it’s way deeper into space.

Djokovic defeats Struff 7-6(5) 6-2 2-6 6-1
Serb pleased with tough start to campaign

MELBOURNE: Second seed Novak Djokovic was forced to work hard by Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff in his first match of the Australian Open on Monday before prevailing 7-6(5) 6-2 2-6 6-1 to stay on course for a record-extending eighth title at Melbourne Park.
Playing against an opponent he defeated both times in straight sets in the past, Djokovic lost his serve four times in the match on Rod Laver Arena, where he beat Rafa Nadal in last year’s final to pick up a seventh Australian Open title.

The 32-year-old, however, managed to play at a different gear in the fourth set and in the end appeared in control of the match against the big-serving German.
“Overall it was a really solid start, especially in the second and the fourth set I played on a higher level. (I) served pretty good, lots of aces, high percentage of first serves in,” Djokovic told reporters.
“I felt kind of in control of the match. Even when I lost the third set I just felt like ‘if I am on the right level, I have the upper hand’. I ended this match in a good fashion, in a right way and this is very positive.”
Djokovic got off to a strong start for a 5-2 lead in the opening set but the German world number 37 fought back to level things at 5-5 before going down in a closely fought tiebreaker.
The second set proved relatively simpler for the winner of 16 Grand Slam singles titles as he converted two breakpoints while showing the same kind of form that helped him lead Serbia to the inaugural ATP Cup title before arriving in Melbourne.
Struff continued to persevere, breaking his opponent three times in the third set, but Djokovic wrested back initiative early in the fourth and closed the match out with the third break of the German’s serve.
“I actually like tough first rounds in Grand Slams particularly,” said Djokovic.
“Historically I had lots of success in Grand Slams where I had tough opponents in first round. Because it gets me going. From the beginning I have to be alert, I have to be on a high level. I think I was.
Djokovic will meet either Japanese wildcard Tatsuma Ito or lucky loser Prajnesh Gunneswaran of India in the second round.

BERLIN: Champions Bayern Munich scored four times in 24 minutes in the second half to crush hosts Hertha Berlin 4-0 on Sunday and move into second place as the Bundesliga resumed after the winter break.
The Bavarians held back in the first half but were unstoppable after the break, riding roughshod over Hertha to move into second place, four points behind leaders RB Leipzig.
Thomas Mueller stabbed in from close range on the hour for his third goal of the season, with Bayern upping the tempo after the break following a largely lacklustre first half.
Robert Lewandowski, back following groin surgery in December, bagged his 20th league goal of this season when the Polish striker sent keeper Rune Jarstein the wrong way to score with a 73rd-minute penalty.
He joined RB Leipzig’s Timo Werner at the top of the league scorers’ list, the first time in Bundesliga history that two players had 20 goals apiece by the 18th matchday.
Three minutes later Thiago Alcantara made it 3-0 with a superb strike and Ivan Perisic headed in at the far post in the 84th from a fine Mueller cross to complete their win and lift Bayern onto 36 points.
“We tired them out and then the spaces became bigger in the second half,” said Mueller. “We were too patient in the first half and were not really dangerous.”
Mueller’s assist for Bayern‘s fourth goal was his 12th on the 18th matchday, the fastest any player has reached this number since records started in the 2004/05 season.
Victory also improved interim manager Hansi Flick’s chances of staying on with his future at the club still unclear after he took over from Nico Kovac back in November.
In the other game on Sunday Bayer Leverkusen moved up to 31 points in sixth with a 4-1 victory over strugglers Paderborn and with two goals from Kevin Volland.
Leipzig are top on 40 after Saturday’s 3-1 win over Union Berlin. Borussia Moenchengladbach dropped to third on 35 following Friday’s 2-0 loss to Schalke 04.

PORT ELIZABETH: England won the third test on Monday, but made heavy weather of wrapping up South Africa’s tail on the last day at St George’s Park to go 2-1 up in the series after a dominant innings and 53-run victory.
England needed four wickets to win in their 500th overseas test, but had to overcome late resistance and feisty 71 from Keshav Maharaj and 39 from debutant Dane Paterson before completing the task 10 minutes before lunch.
They bowled South Africa out for 237 in their second innings for a commanding victory after forcing the follow-on, when the home side were 209 all out in their first innings in reply to a mammoth 499 for nine declared.
Maharaj and Paterson put on a ground test record partnership of 99 for the last wicket as they frustrated the England bowlers.
But it was only a matter of time before England completed their first away victory by an innings since success in Sydney in 2011.
“It’s a great template for how we want to play our test cricket with big first innings score and drive it on from there,” said England captain Joe Root.
It took just three balls on Monday for England to claim their first victim as Stuart Broad forced Vernon Philander (14) to play an inside edge onto his pad that popped up for Ollie Pope to take his sixth catch of the match.
Mark Wood’s first ball after replacing Broad saw him force Kagiso Rabada into a leading edge which flew up to mid-on where Broad took an easy catch. Rabada, who will miss the last test because of suspension, scored 16 off 24 balls.
Dom Bess’ first over saw him skid a ball on to bowl Anrich Nortje (5), leaving Paterson to join Maharaj for a late cameo that proved the home side’s best partnership of a poor test performance.
Maharaj was eventually run out, but not before smashing his way to a second test 50.
Root bowled 10 successive overs as he went in search for a first test five wicket haul, having taken four overnight, but without success.
He even tried his luck with the new ball but Maharaj hit him for three successive fours and then two sixes in an over before the England skipper took himself off.
South Africa won the first test in Pretoria by 107 runs but England bounced back with a 187-run win in Cape Town in the second test. The final test in Johannesburg starts on Friday.

PARIS: Pablo Sarabia struck late to give a reshuffled Paris St Germain a 1-0 win at Ligue 2 side Lorient in the last 32 of the French Cup on Sunday.
Midfielder Sarabia found the back of the net to send the Ligue 1 leaders through along with Angers, Dijon, Montpellier and holders Stade Rennais, who were 2-0 winners at Athletico Marseille.

PSG, who have won the Cup a record 12 times, started at the Moustoir stadium, where they have often struggled, without Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and first-choice keeper Keylor Navas.
Sarabia, however, headed home from Thiago Silva’s cross 10 minutes from fulltime after the visitors had been on the back foot in a poor first half.
Earlier, holders Stade Rennais wrapped up victory in the first half at Marseille’s other club, Athletico, who play in the fifth division, with goals by Hamari Traore and Raphinha.
Fellow Ligue 1 teams Olympique Lyonnais, St Etienne, Lille and Olympique de Marseille also qualified for the next round over the weekend.
Girondins de Bordeaux were the round’s major casualties, losing 3-2 after extra time at third division Pau on Thursday.
The last 16 will be played on Jan. 28-29.

Cristiano Ronaldo struck twice to continue his sensational scoring run and help move Juventus four points clear at the top of Serie A with a 2-1 win over Parma on Sunday.
The 34-year-old’s deflected shot opened the scoring in the first half, but Juve were pegged back after the break when Andreas Cornelius headed in from a corner.

Ronaldo restored the home side’s advantage just three minutes later with a low strike that took his tally for the season to 16 league goals, 11 of which have come in his last seven appearances.
“We knew that Inter drew and Lazio won, so it was important to build an advantage,” Ronaldo told Sky Sport Italia.
“They were two important goals, it was a tough game as Parma are very organised and difficult to beat, but we fought hard and got the victory.”
Maurizio Sarri’s side sit on top of the table with 51 points, four clear of second-placed Inter Milan following their draw at Lecce earlier in the day, while Parma are seventh on 28 points.
Ronaldo lit up an uneventful first half with the game’s first goal two minutes before halftime by cutting inside and firing in a finish, aided by a deflection off Parma defender Matteo Darmian.
The goal made the former Real Madrid star the first Juve player to score in seven consecutive Serie A appearances since David Trezeguet in December 2005.
Parma drew level on the 56th minute when Cornelius guided in a header from a corner, but Ronaldo responded with his second of the night just two minutes later when he fired in from a Paulo Dybala pass.
The visitors pushed forward in search of a late equaliser, but it was Ronaldo who went closest in the closing stages as he forced a save from Luigi Sepe before firing a shot wide as he searched in vain for a hat-trick.

BARCELONA: Barcelona may have a new coach but Lionel Messi remains their unquestionable talisman after guiding the Spanish champions to a nervy 1-0 win at home to Granada in La Liga on Sunday in Quique Setien’s first game in charge of the club.
The Argentine struck the only goal in the 76th minute, firing into the bottom corner to complete a well crafted team move shortly after the visitors had defender German Sanchez sent off.

“Messi did what he has done his entire life,” said Setien of Barca’s all-time top scorer, who proved the difference on a blustery evening at Camp Nou.
“He has done this so many times in games like this, games when you cannot find a way through, things aren’t going for you and you are lacking inspiration, but he always conjures up something special.
“We made a few moves like this in the first half but it didn’t come off but when the ball falls to Messi you know there’s a very high chance it will go in.”
The victory took Barca back to the top of La Liga on 43 points after 20 games, ahead of second-placed Real Madrid on goal difference.
Barca, who sacked Ernesto Valverde last week despite being La Liga leaders and winning the last two titles by considerable margins, enjoyed 82% of possession and made a staggering 1005 passes in their first game under Setien.
The former Real Betis coach is known for his devotion to the possession-based style of play Barca became renowned for under Johan Cruyff and perfected under Pep Guardiola, but Granada, who beat Barca 2-0 in September, proved stubborn opponents.
The visitors even came close to taking the lead when Cameroonian Yan Brice Eteki struck the post in a rare foray forward but they eventually caved in after Sanchez picked up a second yellow card and was dismissed for hauling down Messi.
Messi had come closest to scoring for Barca with two powerful yet inaccurate shots either side of halftime but he made no mistake when Arturo Vidal dragged the ball into his path in a slick passing move engineered by substitute Riqui Puig.
Twenty-year-old Puig was rarely given a look in by Valverde but he was given his first league appearance of the season by 61-year-old Setien, who has pledged to honour the club’s tradition of giving young, home-grown players a chance.
“He did very well, he came on when we were in a good situation with an extra man and he read the game perfectly,” added the coach.
“I’m very happy because we only conceded two shots in the game, we did many things well and I hope that little by little we’ll get more fluid and get sharper in front of goal.”

Liverpool win 2-0 to go 16 points clear
Van Dijk opens the scoring, Salah strikes in stoppage time
Rashford facing spell out for United

LIVERPOOL: Liverpool came through a high-octane tussle with old rivals Manchester United to win 2-0 at Anfield and move 16 points clear at the top of the table on Sunday, sparking a chorus of “we are going to win the league” from their now expectant fans.

Juergen Klopp’s side, chasing their maiden title in the Premier League era and first in the top flight in 30 years, took a 14th-minute lead from a Virgil van Dijk header but had to wait until stoppage time to put the game to bed through Mohamed Salah.
With a game in hand on second-placed Manchester City, Liverpool’s grip on the title race tightened and while Klopp was not about to echo the euphoric sentiments of the club’s jubilant fans, he was upbeat about his team’s display.
“It’s a big relief, I was really happy with 85-90% of the game, we were brilliant. We dominated the game, especially in the first half. The energy they put on the pitch was incredible,” said the German, whose side have dropped just two points in 22 games.
For United, who battled hard but were outclassed in all departments, it was another reminder of just how much work is ahead of them if they are to get back to being in contention for titles.
United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer suffered another blow to his hopes of qualifying for the Champions League with the news that his top scorer Marcus Rashford was not only out for the trip to Anfield but could face several weeks on the sidelines with a back injury.
United are in fifth place in the league, five points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, and while no-one could question the commitment of Solskjaer’s players it is clear he needs some immediate transfer reinforcements.
“The players gave us everything. Today we hung on a bit at the start of the second half, but the last 25-30 minutes we pressed them and pushed them back. I’m disappointed with conceding from a corner and with the last kick – but very many positives,” he said.
FIRM HEADER
After a promising start from the visitors, Van Dijk put Liverpool ahead with a firm header after he was poorly marked by United, who allowed him to rise and nod in a Trent Alexander-Arnold corner.
Roberto Firmino thought he had scored a second but a VAR review ruled that Van Dijk had fouled United keeper David de Gea before the ball fell to the Brazilian.
Liverpool had the ball in the net again when Georginio Wijnaldum slotted home after a clever defence-splitting pass from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain but the Dutchman was ruled narrowly offside.
United’s attacking forages were rare but they caused some anxiety for Klopp when Andreas Pereira slid in but could not make contact with a low ball across the face of the goal from Aaron Wan Bissaka.
Yet after the break, Liverpool looked determined to put the outcome beyond doubt.
Salah missed a glorious chance from close range just after the interval during an intense period of pressure from the home side, in which Jordan Henderson also hit the post.
United survived that blitz and clawed their way back into the game and could even have snatched an equaliser but Anthony Martial blasted high and wide in the 59th minute.
Solskjaer’s side applied some late pressure but were caught on the counter-attack in the final moments when, with all United players forward, Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker launched a long ball for Salah who raced clear before slotting home and settling Anfield’s nerves.
“It’s special. We’re enjoying our football. You have to stay hungry and keep wanting more,” said Henderson, who looks well set to be raising another piece of silverware at the end of this campaign after lifting the Champions League trophy last season.

The hosts responded after the interval with striker Chris Wood scoring the equaliser from a rebound after Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel saved a header from Ben Mee.
Leicester, third in the standings, had an opportunity to reclaim the lead when Mee brought down Barnes in the box but Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope made a spectacular save to deny Jamie Vardy’s penalty.
The turnaround was complete when Ashley Westwood scored with 11 minutes remaining to earn Burnley all three points, lifting them to 14th place in the table.

BENGALURU: Rohit Sharma smashed a scintillating century and Virat Kohli starred in another successful chase as India beat Australia by seven wickets in the final one-dayer on Sunday to complete a 2-1 series victory.
Steve Smith’s first ODI hundred in three years had propelled Australia to 286-9, although the tourists at one stage looked set for a 300-plus total at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.
Rohit’s 119 laid the foundation for India’s chase and Kohli made 89 as three premier batsmen of their era shone in a mouthwatering contest.
Earlier, Australia captain Aaron Finch won the toss and elected to bat but the touring side did not get the strong start they expected from their openers.
David Warner fell cheaply and Finch ran himself out after an almighty mix-up with Smith as both finished up at the same end.
Smith redeemed himself with a typically fluent knock, adding 127 runs with the in-form Marnus Labuschagne (54), before wickets started tumbling at the other end.
Kohli took a stunning one-handed catch to send back Labuschagne and Mitchell Starc, promoted in the order as a pinch-hitter, fell in the same Ravindra Jadeja over.
Smith could not be denied his ninth ODI century, however, and the prolific Australian made a run-a-ball 131 before holing out in the deep.
Jasprit Bumrah bowled with characteristic parsimony and Mohammed Shami (4-63) produced a string of yorkers to hurt Australia who lost their last five wickets for 51 runs.
India suffered a blow before beginning their chase with opener Shikhar Dhawan hobbling off after hurting his shoulder while fielding.
KL Rahul, who batted at numbers three and five in the last two matches, made 19 opening the innings with Rohit whose 137-run stand with Kohli put India on course for victory.
Fed juicy half-trackers by the Australian spinners, Rohit smacked half a dozen sixes in his 29th ODI century.
The elegant right-hander, named 2019 ODI Player of the Year last week, also completed 9000 ODI runs in his 224th match.
Kohli occasionally struggled to read Adam Zampa’s googly but kept India on course after Rohit’s departure.

PORT ELIZABETH: England were seven wickets away from winning the third test on Sunday after reducing South Africa to 44 for three in their follow-on on the fourth day, still trailing by 246 runs.
Rain delayed England’s bid for a 2-1 series lead but they managed four wickets, for the loss of a single run, to dismiss the home team for 209 and, when the skies cleared, took three more as South Africa faltered again.
Pieter Malan (12) was trapped lbw by England captain Joe Root with the last ball before tea, leaving Rassie van der Dussen to join captain Faf du Plessis (12 not out) for the evening session.
The hosts need to bat for another five sessions to force an unlikely draw at St George’s Park and go to the last test in Johannesburg with a chance to win the series.
Seamer Stuart Broad ripped through South Africa’s tail in the opening 27 minutes of the morning to allow England to enforce the follow-on and Mark Wood grabbed the first two wickets in the second innings.
The beleaguered home team resumed overnight on 208 for six, with Vernon Philander (27) and Quinton de Kock (63) having put on 54 for the seventh wicket but facing a new ball that had been taken by England late on the third evening.
It took Broad (3-30) only six balls to make the breakthrough, finding seam movement to clean bowl Philander.
De Kock followed five balls later as seamer Sam Curran hit the top of middle stump.
That realistically ended South Africa’s hopes of avoiding the follow-on. Keshav Maharaj (0) chopped a Broad delivery onto his stumps and Kagiso Rabada (1) chipped Broad to Wood at mid-off.
South Africa were 15-0 when rain brought a three-hour halt to proceedings, but when they resumed England picked up where they left off as Wood bowled Dean Elgar for 15 and snagged Zubayr Hamza, strangled down the leg side for two.
South Africa won the first test in Pretoria by 107 runs before the tourists hit back with a 189-run success in Cape Town.
The final test of the four-match series starts at The Wanderers on Friday.

PORT ELIZABETH: Seamer Stuart Broad ripped through South Africa’s tail to allow England to enforce the follow-on on the fourth morning of the third test before rain interrupted their victory charge at St George’s Park on Sunday.
The hosts are 15 without loss in their second innings, still 275 runs behind England’s 499 for nine declared after South Africa capitulated for 209 as they lost four wickets for a single run added when play resumed on day four.
Dean Elgar (13 not out) and Pieter Malan (1 not out) began South Africa’s second innings with the home side needing to negotiate the best part of five sessions to salvage a draw, potentially aided by rain showers forecast for Sunday and Monday.
South Africa had resumed on 208 for six, with Vernon Philander (27) and Quinton de Kock (63) having put on 54 for the seventh wicket but facing a new ball that had been taken by England late on the third evening.

LONDON: Even when Liverpool are not in action they continue to bolster their seemingly impregnable Premier League lead and it happened again on Saturday as second-placed Manchester City could only draw 2-2 with Crystal Palace at the Etihad Stadium.
Fernandinho’s 90th-minute own goal robbed them of victory and left Pep Guardiola’s side 13 points behind Liverpool who have played two games less and who can stretch their advantage to 16 if they beat Manchester United on Sunday.
On a big day at the bottom of the table, bottom side Norwich City gave themselves a lifeline with a 1-0 defeat of free-falling Bournemouth in a match in which both sides had a man sent off.
Norwich remain six points adrift of the safety zone but Teemu Pukki’s first-half penalty, awarded after Bournemouth skipper Steve Cook handled and was red-carded, gives them hope.
Watford’s revival continued as they took their points tally in new manager Nigel Pearson’s seven games in charge to 14, although Troy Deeney missed a penalty in their 0-0 home draw with Tottenham Hotspur who have stalled under Jose Mourinho.
Tottenham are in eighth spot after a four-game winless run, two places higher than Arsenal who could only draw 1-1 at home to Sheffield United, who continue to impress in seventh place.
Brazilian teenager Gabriel Martinelli gave Arsenal the lead but John Fleck earned the Blades a draw.
Both Tottenham and Arsenal’s hopes of challenging for a top-four finish are fading by the week. However, Chelsea missed the chance to open up a commanding lead over their rivals as they slipped to a 1-0 defeat by Newcastle United in the day’s late kickoff.
Chelsea had chances to snatch victory in a tight affair at St James’ Park, but their profligacy in front of goal proved costly, as Isaac Hayden headed a dramatic stoppage-time winner to earn his side a first win in five league games.
Southampton’s surge hit the buffers as they surrendered a 2-0 lead at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers to lose 3-2.
Mexican striker Raul Jimenez struck twice after the break for Wolves who moved into sixth spot.
RELEGATION DOGFIGHT
David Moyes’s West Ham United drew 1-1 at home to his old club Everton to remain in the thick of the relegation dogfight while Aston Villa and Brighton & Hove Albion drew 1-1 with Jack Grealish equalising for Villa who stay third from bottom.
Manchester City’s frenetic afternoon rather summed up their season so far, as they misfired against a Palace side who beat them in the corresponding fixture last season.
Sergio Aguero struck twice to overturn a deficit after debutant Cenk Tosun gave Palace a 39th-minute lead. It took Aguero above Frank Lampard into fourth spot on the all-time Premier League scoring list with 179 goals.
But City’s relief turned to frustration as Wilfried Zaha powered past John Stones and his cross deflected in off Fernandinho and beat City goalkeeper Ederson.
“It was a tight game and unfortunately we could not win it,” Guardiola said.
Premier League history, of sorts, was made at Carrow Road where Paul Tierney became the first Premier League referee to send off a player after consulting a pitch-side monitor, adjudging Norwich’s Ben Godfrey’s late challenge on Callum Wilson worthy of the harshest punishment.
It ratcheted up the tension for the home fans as Norwich should have been more than one goal ahead by the time Godfrey went off to make it 10 versus 10 in the 76th minute.
But Norwich hung on to condemn Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth to a fourth consecutive defeat and leave them second from bottom, three points behind 17th-placed Watford.
“It is an important win for us. Three points, clean sheet, good for mood and confidence and the table. A good evening for us,” Norwich boss Daniel Farke said. “There were some spicy moments in the last 10 minutes and anything can happen.”
Bournemouth have picked up four points from the last 36 on offer in the Premier League.

The TAC came under further pressure at 116-7 after Rajesh Pulami Magari was dismissed in the 28th over. Skipper Binod Bhandari and Bikram Sob shared a 53-run partnership for the eighth wicket to help the team post a respectable total.
Bhandari top scored with 40 off 66 balls, while Magar contributed 49-ball 31 and opener Rijal chipped in 22 off 36 balls.
The three batsmen struck four boundaries each. Sob (15), Malla (13) and Paudel (11) also scored in double figures but they could not convert them into big knocks. Paudel struck the lone six of the innings.

Kushal Bhurtel top scored for the team with 27-ball 31 hitting three fours and two sixes, while Amit Shrestha struck four boundaries in his 23 off 28 balls. Anil Kumar Sah contributed 21 off 18 balls hitting one each four and six.
Man-of-the-match Sushan Bhari was the pick of the TAC bowlers taking 4-24 from six overs, and he was ably supported by fellow left-arm spinner Shahab Alam, who grabbed 3-33 in 6.4 overs.

The draw meant three teams MMC were tied on 13 points with Tribhuvan Army Club and Machhindra Football Club after seven matches.
TAC, who have played one match less than the other two teams, are at the top, followed by Machhindra and Manang.
Three Star are at the fourth position with 11 points ahead of Nepal Police Club, who defeated Prabhu Jawalakhel Youth Club 2-0 in an early kickoff at the ANFA Complex grounds. NPC also accumulated 11 points to move up to fifth after their third win, thanks to goals from Saujan Rai and skipper Suman Subedi. JYC remained at the sixth position with nine points.
At the Dasharath Stadium, TSC opened the scoring in the 19th minute when Rammavra converted a free kick from the edge of the penalty box into a sensational goal as the ball hit the inside edge of the cross bar before entering the goal. Anjan Bista levelled the scores from the spot after Ashok Khawas brought down the striker inside the box four minutes into the second half.
Man-of-the-match Bista put MMC ahead in 69th minute through yet another set piece.
Fed by Kamal Shrestha from just outside the penalty box, Bista’s header hit the post and entered the goal leaving Three Star custodian Guillaume Yves Priso Njanga stranded.

Jadon Sancho levelled for the visitors and Haaland then tapped in Dortmund’s fourth in the 70th to put them ahead.

NEWCASTLE: Newcastle United claimed a first win in their last five Premier League games in dramatic style as Isaac Hayden headed a last-gasp winner to seal a 1-0 victory over top-four chasing Chelsea at St James’ Park on Saturday.
Chances were few and far between in the first half, with Newcastle’s struggling striker Joelinton going closest, heading against the crossbar.
After the break, Willian fired wide following a swift Chelsea counter, before Tammy Abraham missed the target after rounding Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka as the visitors remained frustrated.
Chelsea’s leading goalscorer this season Abraham thought he had won it late on, but his flicked effort was cleared off the line by Matt Ritchie, another chance that went begging for the visitors.

Just as the game looked to be heading for a stalemate, Newcastle earned one last corner in stoppage time, with Hayden rising highest to meet the cross from Allan Saint-Maximin to send St James’ into raptures.
The result moves Steve Bruce’s side up to 12th in the standings on 29 points from 23 games, with Chelsea remaining in fourth place.
“We didn’t score — it has been the story of part of our season,” Chelsea boss Frank Lampard said. “We can’t just rely on Tammy. We have to score goals across the front line.”
Newcastle manager Bruce has lamented the long injury list he has had to work with of late, but three key players were back for Chelsea’s visit with Jonjo Shelvey, Saint-Maximin and captain Jamaal Lascelles all fit to start.
That bad luck with injuries continued, however, as Jetro Willems was carried off on a stretcher early on.
Joelinton, who has one league goal since his becoming Newcastle’s club record signing in the close season, headed against the crossbar in the 21st minute as the hosts took the game to Chelsea.
A superb pass from Reece James set N’Golo Kante up for the game’s next chance, but the Premier League’s most prolific shotstopper, Dubravka, made another timely save.
Chelsea created several openings after the break, only for poor finishing and determined defending keeping them from scoring.
Abraham, after twice going close, was substituted, looking frustrated as he walked off, but Chelsea still could not find the crucial breakthrough.
The deciding strike came after Ritchie’s corner had been cleared, only for Saint-Maximin to cross brilliantly for Hayden to head home and give Bruce a second-ever win over Chelsea as a manager.
“Today we didn’t seem to carry a threat,” Bruce said. “But one great ball or delivery and you may call it smash and grab but it is good to see.”

MADRID: Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro produced a performance worthy of a top striker by scoring twice in a 2-1 win for Zinedine Zidane’s side over Sevilla on Saturday that took them top of La Liga for at least 24 hours.
Sevilla, however, were left fuming by the decision to rule out a first-half header from Luuk de Jong from a corner after a VAR review of a challenge by midfielder Nemanja Gudelj on Real defender Eder Militao.

Brazilian Casemiro, initially deployed as a holding midfielder, broke the deadlock in the 57th minute with an ice-cool dinked finish after a back-heel from Serbian forward Luka Jovic released him in the area.
Sevilla levelled in the 64th with a curled effort from Dutch striker De Jong which was allowed to stand even though the ball had bounced off the elbow of forward Munir El Haddadi in the build-up.
With Real missing a number of key players including Federico Valverde, Sergio Ramos, Gareth Bale and Eden Hazard, it fell to Casemiro to drag them back in front moments after De Jong’s leveller, with a towering header.
The win took his side first in the standings on 43 points after 20 games, three ahead of champions Barcelona who host Granada on Sunday.
Sevilla stayed in fourth place on 35 points after an unhappy return to the Santiago Bernabeu for coach Julen Lopetegui, who was sacked by Real in October 2018 after a miserable tenure succeeding Zidane.
The coach reacted furiously to the decision to rule out De Jong’s goal for the tangle between Gudelj and Militao and could be seen saying “this is shameful” as he walked down the tunnel at halftime.
“I cannot understand how they could rule out that goal, there is no reason at all, for me it was a huge error,” he said.
“ANGRY AND OUTRAGED”
Sevilla’s sporting director Monchi also did not hold back in his criticism of the referee.
“It’s the type of thing you see all the time, and I refuse to analyse the game after that because that moment was key and it’s absurd to try and give any analysis after a goal like that was ruled out. I’m angry and outraged,” he told reporters.
“If they had ruled out our other goal, I would have gone down to the pitch and ordered my players to leave.”
Gudelj added: “I didn’t think it was a foul, I stayed still and Militao crashed into me. After seeing it again I still think it’s not a foul and the referee got it wrong.”
Real manager Zidane said he thought the referee was right to rule out the goal and suggested Sevilla had little right to complain after their second strike was given despite the handball.
“All I can say is I saw the play and there’s a clear block, it’s a foul for me, the referee looked at the screen and gave a foul. In the second incident there’s a handball and he doesn’t rule it out,” Zidane said.
“I can’t explain anything and I don’t like to comment, referees are the ones who decide and it’s a tough job. Sometimes decisions go for you other times they go against you.
“For me it’s a clear block, it’s a foul, it’s all very normal. There’s no need to complain.”

362,https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/rabada-ban-is-cause-for-concern-says-south-africa-coach-boucher/,"PORT ELIZABETH: South African coach Mark Boucher said he was concerned about the disciplinary regulations in cricket which led to fast bowler Kagiso Rabada being handed a one-match ban due to his overexuberant celebration during the third test against England.
Rabada was fined and handed a demerit point as he was deemed to have been provocative as he loudly celebrated Joe Root’s dismissal on the first day of the third test.
The demerit point was the fourth he had accrued over a two-year period, hence it triggered an automatic one-match ban – which means Rabada will be absent from next week’s contest in Johannesburg.
“I am concerned, to be honest… you don’t want to take all the aggression out of test cricket. You’ve got two countries playing hard cricket against each other,” former wicketkeeper Boucher, who played 147 tests, said.
“There are heated situations, the guys are trying really hard and sometimes their emotions overflow.”
Boucher said he was concerned the rules and regulations did not take into account the intensity of the test arena.
“I understand where there ICC are going with it and hopefully they find a balance that they don’t take the emotion out of the game because I think there is still a big part for that in the game of cricket.”
Boucher said he did not think there was anything wrong with Rabada’s celebration, during which he stormed down the wicket and bellowed at the ground under Root’s nose.
“I wasn’t aware about all the demerit points and how it quite works,” said Boucher, who took charge of the team last month.
“It’s tough because he wasn’t even looking at the batsman but he was in his space.
“The bottom line is that … the match referee has made up his mind.
“In his eyes it was a misdemeanor and a level one charge, which is almost like a slap on the wrist, but because of previous demerits he won’t be playing in the next test.
“In our days we didn’t have to deal with this stuff. We could pretty much say what we wanted and get away with it.”
Boucher admitted that losing Rabada for the final test against England is a “massive blow” for South Africa.
“He’s a world class performer especially at the Wanderers where he will be very effective. It’s very disappointing,” said Boucher.
“KG is a team man and he’ll be feeling very disappointed about it and it’s something we’ll have to address.”

PANCHTHAR: Timbung Lake, situated in between Panchthar and Taplejung districts, has grabbed the attention of travellers with it’s spectacular natural beauty, in recent times.
The lake is situated at 4,480 metres above the sea level.
A majority of domestic tourists as well as foreign tourists including from India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh come to visit the lake, especially from May to October.
Most of them come to enjoy sightseeing, view the scenic beauty of Himalayas and for religious purpose of late.
With the upgradation of trekking trails, other infrastructure and effective advertisement of the Lake, the number of tourists visiting the site has increased significantly in recent years, Khadak Bhandari, homestay entrepreneur, noted.
“We are trying our best to give optimum services to our guest. The lake is really like heaven,” Bhandari shared.
“The place is really amazing, beautiful and pristine. With better promotion, this place can be developed into a major touristic destination of eastern Nepal as it has lots of potentials,” Giriraj Gyawali, a traveller from Gulmi district, who made a maiden trip to Timbung Lake, shared.
“In comparison to earlier days, we receive at least 500 tourists during trekking season in recent days,” Bhim Bhandari, one of the homestay operator, said.

Buses from Tokyo’s Shinjuku district conveniently drop climbers off at a station located at the 2,300-metre (7,546 feet) point of the majestic mountain, the country’s tallest at 3,776 metres (12,388 feet). It’s not cheating. This is where most people start the long — and crowded — trek.





The Yoshida trail is the easiest and most popular among the routes to the top, with climbers wearing headlamps and carrying heavy packs spaced just feet apart on the rugged, rocky terrain. It takes an average hiker five to six hours to reach the summit. Most spend the night in simple mountain huts and start the final ascent in darkness. Crammed together in the sparse accommodations is part of the communal climbing experience.
Witnessing the sunrise from the summit of the nation’s symbolic mountain is hard to top. Watching it paint the sky deep orange is magnificent.
Climbing season runs from early July to early September, Mount Fuji will open to the public a couple of weeks before the Tokyo Summer Olympics opening ceremony on July 24.
After the descent, visit picturesque Lake Kawaguchi to photograph Mount Fuji from afar.

BANGKOK: Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, edged out Paris and London as the world’s most popular city to visit, according to a survey released on Wednesday, welcome news for Thailand after worries over a drop in foreign arrivals.
Bangkok was named the most-visited city for the fourth consecutive year, with about 22.8 million visitors reported in the annual rankings by MasterCard Inc.
Paris and London were ranked second and third, each with about 19.1 million arrivals, trailed by Dubai with 15.9 million.
Other Southeast Asian cities, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were fourth and fifth in the rankings, based on third-party research, proprietary analysis and public data across 200 destination cities.
New York, Istanbul, Tokyo and Antalya, Turkey, rounded out the top 10.
The number of international visitors across the 200 cities grew by 76% in the last 10 years.
Despite Bangkok’s longtime reign atop the list, the Thai tourism industry has faced headwinds, with arrivals dropping 1.03% year-on-year in May before recovering to grow 0.89% in June from a year earlier.
Tourism accounts for about 12% of Thailand’s economy.
However, weaker Chinese economic growth and a boat accident last year led to a drop off in Chinese arrivals in Thailand in the first half of this year.
The downturn in the number of visitors from China was partially offset by Indian arrivals.
Thailand expects to welcome 2 million Indian tourists in 2019, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, told Reuters, adding this was one year earlier than its target.
In August, the government extended a waiver of a 2,000 baht ($65) fee for visa-on-arrivals for tourists from 18 countries including those from China and India.
A growing middle class and increasing wealth in populations and the rise of low-cost airlines will make travel more accessible, Minor Hotels Chief Executive, Dilip Rajakrier, said in an email.
“Given only less than 10% of the China’s total population having passports today. The potential of the Chinese market will never fade,” he said.

371,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/thailand-extends-visa-fee-waivers-to-boost-tourism-as-growth-slows/,"BANGKOK: Thailand will extend until April next year a measure that waives fees for visas on arrival issued to tourists from 18 countries, as it looks to stimulate growth in tourism to spur a slowing economy, the prime minister said on Tuesday.
The waivers are part of a $10-billion stimulus package to boost growth, including a debt moratorium for farmers, loans for smaller businesses, and more money for low-income earners.
“The cabinet approved the extension of fee waivers until April 2020,” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters, adding that the scheme would cover Lunar New Year and the Thai new year, Songkran.
Foreign tourist receipts make up about 12% of Southeast Asia’s second largest economy, but arrivals increased just 0.89% in June, with visitors from China, the biggest source, declining 7.1% from a year earlier.
The fee of 2,000 baht ($65) is to be waived unil next year for travellers from 18 countries, including China and India.
But the cabinet rejected a proposal for visa-free entry for visitors from China and India, because of security concerns, government spokesman Narumon Pinyosinwat said.

Sunrise wasn’t spectacular on that recent summer day. But even ordinary dawn at Borobudur Temple — nine stone tiers stacked like a wedding cake and adorned with hundreds of Buddha statues and relief panels — provided a memorable experience.

The 9th-century temple is in the centre of Indonesia’s Java island, a densely populated region with stunning vistas. Other highlights include the towering Hindu temple complex of Prambanan, like Borobudur a UNESCO World Heritage site, and Mount Merapi, the country’s most active volcano, whose lava-covered slopes are accessible by jeep.
While the two temples draw many visitors, other foreigners head to the relaxing beaches of Bali, just east of Java and by far the most popular tourist destination in a nation of thousands of islands and almost 270 million people. More than 6 million tourists visited Bali last year, or about 40 per cent of 15.8 million visitors to Indonesia overall, according to official figures.
Recently reelected President Joko Widodo wants to change this dynamic by pushing ahead with “10 new Balis,” an ambitious plan to boost tourism and diversify Southeast Asia’s largest economy.
Key to the plan is to upgrade provincial airports and improve access to outlying destinations, such as Lake Toba on Sumatra island, more than 1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from Jakarta, the capital. Yogyakarta, the provincial city from where visitors head to Borobudur and Prambanan, is getting a second airport, expected to be fully operational later this year.
Widodo has been promoting his plan in meetings with foreign leaders and in recent interviews, including with The Associated Press, in hopes of encouraging foreign investment. The president of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation told the AP in late July that as part of his push, he would like to see more business ties with the Middle East.
“For investment and tourism, we would like to invite investors from the Middle East as much as possible because … we have many tourism locations in Indonesia, not only one or two or four, but many,” said Widodo. He did not give specifics.
Muslim tourists, including from the Middle East, might also be an easier fit for some of the more conservative areas earmarked for tourism development. Tourism officials have played down the possibility of cultural friction that might accompany the influx of more non-Muslim visitors, arguing that Indonesia’s brand of tolerant Islam can accommodate everyone.
“Maybe there are some particular locations that are very strict (religiously),” said Hiramsyah Thaib, who heads the “10 New Balis” initiative. “We believe we won’t have any problems. Sometimes we have problems in the media, but not in reality.”
Yet Islamic hard-liners have become more assertive in recent years, potentially spooking investors by undermining Indonesia’s image as a moderate nation. Thaib said he believes investor confidence rose “significantly” after Widodo defeated former special forces general Prabowo Subianto in April’s presidential election. Subianto had been backed by Muslim groups favouring Shariah law.
The tourism plan remains key to Widodo’s final five-year term, though at least one target — 20 million visitors this year — appears to have been too ambitious. The 2019 visitor tally is expected to be 18 million, based on current growth figures, said Thaib.
Still, the Indonesian tourism sector grew by 7.8 per cent in 2018, or twice the global average, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
One of the 10 sites earmarked for development is the Borobudur Temple area and nearby Yogyakarta, a city of several hundred thousand people that are embedded in a large metro area. The city is a centre of Javanese culture and a seat of royal dynasties going back centuries.
In 2017, former President Barack Obama and his family visited the city, where his late mother, Ann Dunham, spent years doing anthropological research. Obama, who lived in Indonesia as a child, toured Borobudur and Prambanan during the nostalgic trip.
But while the Obamas got around with relative ease, including private jet travel, ordinary visitors struggle with congested streets packed with motorbikes weaving in and out of slow-moving traffic.
Travellers hoping to be in place at Borobudur just before sunrise need at least 90 minutes to get there from Yogyakarta, a journey of 40 kilometres (24 miles). A 230-kilometre (140-mile) round trip to the Dieng highlands, with terraced fields, small temples and a colourful volcanic lake, requires a full day of travel, some of it on bumpy back roads.
Anton McLaughlin, a 55-year-old visitor from York, England, said he was astounded by the number of motorbikes in the streets. Speaking during a jeep tour of the slopes of Mount Merapi, he said he’s become more aware of the natural disasters Indonesians endure regularly. Indonesia straddles the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Merapi’s last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people, and the ruins of one destroyed hamlet were part of the tour.
“People just seem to crack on with life,” McLaughlin said.
Just a day after his tour, the volcano shot out hot clouds and lava that flowed 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) down its slopes. No casualties or damage were reported.
Jan Tenbrinke, 37, from Zwolle in the Netherlands, said Bali is the next stop for his family of four, but that he hoped to get a better sense of Indonesian culture in Yogyakarta.
In the city, tourists can visit workshops for Batik textiles, silver jewellery and Kopi Luwak — coffee made from partially digested coffee cherries that were eaten and defecated by wild tree cats, or civets. Billed as the “world’s most expensive coffee,” Kopi Luwak became known to a wider audience in the 2007 Jack Nicholson-Morgan Freeman movie “The Bucket List.”
Local museums, including two royal palaces and a former Dutch fort, pose a challenge for foreign visitors eager to learn more about local history and culture because they mostly lack easily accessible explanations in English.
Thaib, the tourism official, acknowledged that there is room for improvement. He said Indonesia is determined to catch up to other Asian nations, including Thailand, which he said began developing their tourism industries much sooner.
“There is still a lot of work,” he said of his nation’s efforts. “We believe we are on the right track.”

HIKKADUWA: Sipping fresh coconut water while sunbathing on deserted Hikkaduwa beach, Alexi Konchayenko, a sports trainer from Ukraine, struck a stoical note.
Bomb blasts can happen “anywhere, anytime,” he said, adding that he was not afraid. “Sri Lanka is an amazing country. This is my first visit and I will tell my friends also to come.”
His is a lone voice — and a lone presence. Sri Lanka was the Lonely Planet guide’s top travel destination for 2019, but since the Easter Sunday attacks on churches and luxury hotels, foreign tourists have fled.
Many of those booked to come in the next few months have cancelled. Hotel occupancy across the island has plummeted by 85% to 90%. The tropical beaches, restaurants and shops are empty.
The coordinated suicide bombings on April 21 not only destroyed lives but also wiped out the livelihoods of Sri Lankans who depend on tourism.
More than 250 people, including 45 foreigners mainly from China, India, the US and the UK, died in the Islamic State group-claimed blasts.
Tourists normally come to Hikkaduwa, in the southwest, for the strong waves that are perfect for surfing and sparkling clear waters made for snorkelling. Today, of the 27 hotels, very few are open. Most, along with the eateries that line the 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of palm-fringed beach, are closed.
Among the few hotels still open is Hikkaduwa Beach Hotel. On April 21, all 50 rooms were occupied; today, only a handful. “It’s a real disaster. We don’t know what to do right now,” said Sanjeewani Yogarajah, an executive with the hotel. She said the attack has cost the hotel 5.5 million Sri Lankan rupees ($31,000), forcing the hotel’s management to send half the staff home.
Some tourism officials say the damage to the industry after the bombings is worse than during the 26-year civil war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the government which ended a decade ago. At least then, the violence was mostly contained to the north of Sri Lanka, they said. This time, no part of the island has remained untouched by the blasts.
Lankesha Ponnamperuma, general manager of hotel chain Hikka Tranz, is one of the luckier ones. While most hotels report wholesale cancellations, he is surviving thanks to business from local residents. Last Friday, two-thirds of the 150 rooms were booked, mostly by domestic tourists.
“I haven’t sacked anyone yet. Instead, we are training our people to adjust their expenditure and helping them restructure their bank loans,” Ponnamperuma said.
The president of Sri Lanka’s Hotels Association, Sanath Ukwatta, said hotels have offered 30-50% discounts to entice local residents.
Such a strategy won’t solve the problem, he said, but will “help at least to keep the hotels going.”
The manager of a clothing shop said the owner had shut the group’s other two shops and the factory too. “Business collapsed after April 21,” said Kumari, who declined to give her surname.
According to government figures, there has been an 80% drop in arrivals since the attack. Tourism accounts for 4.9% of Sri Lanka’s GDP. Last year, 2.3 million tourists visited the island, generating $4.4 billion in revenues, a nearly 12% jump from 2017. Around half a million Sri Lankans directly depend on tourism while 2 million depend on it indirectly.
One of them is Mohomed Musflick, the owner of a souvenir shop in Galle which is full of wood carvings, local paintings and postcards. “I have not sold one item. There are no tourists and we are in a huge crisis,” he said.
While life is gradually returning to normal on the island with offices and schools re-opening, the tourism industry is in a sombre mood over the slump in foreign tourists. Tour operators from Russia, Norway and Britain have cancelled bookings going right up to April 2020.
A travel ban issued by nearly a dozen countries is the greatest cause for concern. “The ban is our main worry. Until it is removed or softened, we can’t start our marketing to attract tourists. If it is lifted soon, we are hopeful we can bounce back this year or otherwise definitely next year for sure,” said Yogarajah.
In the meantime, Sri Lanka’s government should target “people and countries resilient to this kind of attacks and situations, such as Russia, Israel and India,” said Anusha Frydman, managing director of the Lavanga Resort and Spa.
The industry is clear about what else it wants from the authorities: Ensure that stringent security measures are in place to reassure potential visitors; persuade politicians to put their differences aside and adopt a bipartisan approach on national security; and work fast to get the travel ban lifted.
To help the industry cope, the government has put together a relief package comprising easy loans at special rates and reduced taxes. The government also plans to formulate a $100 million insurance fund for compensation to any tourist injured or killed while visiting the island.
“In the past we have had many serious crises and we have recovered. I am quite positive we can do it again,” said Jan van Twest, general manager of the Fortress Resort and Spa near Galle, where 750 room nights have been cancelled from May to October.
“But we need to recover, recover very fast,” he said.

Whenever I told someone I was planning to climb to Mount Everest Base Camp this spring, I received the same shocked and wide-eyed response: “Be careful!” While that’s good advice for any adventure, it was difficult to convince friends and family that this trip would not at all be the same thing as actually climbing Mount Everest.
Instead, the Everest Base Camp Trek provides an opportunity for regular hikers like me to tackle a feasible portion of one of the most iconic climbs in the world.
Base Camp is located at 17,600 feet, well below the peak of Everest, which is 29,000 feet. Base Camp is where those planning to summit spend weeks acclimatising and preparing for their journey. It is also the furthest you can go using only your legs before other equipment like ropes and ice picks get involved.
Our eight-day journey to Base Camp began at 9,300 feet, in the small Nepalese mountain town of Lukla. There are no roads to Lukla. It is accessible only by a 30-minute plane ride from Kathmandu. When we landed, I was shocked to find the area crowded and bustling, filled with locals selling trinkets and outdoor gear, and what felt like hundreds of trekkers preparing for their climbs.
From Lukla, we wound our way up muddy paths and across dangling suspension bridges, stepping aside for herds of yak and dzo (yak/cattle hybrids) as we walked further and further into the most remote area in which I have ever hiked.
Yet, it didn’t feel that way. Small towns continued to greet us all the way up. There were lodges to stay in. There were restaurants and bars. I have photos at the world’s highest Irish pub and the world’s highest bakery. In one of the larger towns, Namche Bazaar, at about 11,200 feet, there was even a North Face store. In these towns, dozens of miles from the nearest road, all food and supplies are brought in by helicopter, porter or animal.
In addition to breathtaking, 360-degree views of the Himalayas, elaborate Buddhist monuments lie along the entire route. Every day along the trail we saw massive, intricately painted boulders and colourful stupas (structures meant to bring good karma) wrapped in multicoloured prayer flags. At one point, we even toured a large, fully functioning monastery.
The terrain itself is not as difficult as you’d expect. Anyone in good physical shape could do it, and I have done many other hikes that I found more challenging. We still climbed several thousand feet per day, but the inclines were relatively gradual. This trek, instead, should be known for its panoramic views and the unique experience of hiking through these remote mountain towns.
Of course, the trip is not without risks, but they lie in unexpected places. The flights to and from Lukla are the most dangerous part of the journey. The Lukla airport has long been considered one of the most dangerous airports in the world — and in fact, a fatal crash occurred while we were there. I tried to push the knowledge of the airport’s dangers to the furthest recesses of my mind as I boarded a tiny propeller plane bound for that very place.
The plane ride is beautiful, with mountains on all sides, but the landing is enough to put even the fiercest adventurer on edge. A standard runway is between 6,000-8,000 feet long; Lukla’s is only 1,700 feet long. It’s sloped upward to help slow the plane before it hits the solid rock wall waiting at the end of it. At the other end is a 2,000-foot drop. After landing safely, we were mesmerised watching the planes taking off for Kathmandu literally fly off the edge of a cliff.
Altitude sickness is also a concern, though if you work with an experienced guiding company as we did, they will ensure you climb up slowly to acclimatise. We had two layover days and hiked a far shorter distance each day than our bodies were capable of going. This itinerary helped us grow accustomed to the air as it grew thinner.
Hiking up slowly didn’t feel like a burden, though, as it allowed extra time to take in those jaw-dropping views. The higher I climbed, the more I felt like I could reach out and touch the shimmering, snow-capped peaks. The further we progressed, the more the mountains seemed to bend toward us like we were inside of a snow globe.
At several points, we caught sight of Everest’s majestic peak peering out from behind its neighbours. Most of Everest lies in Tibet, but the peak is in Nepal. As such, the trek to Base Camp does not actually take place on Mount Everest, but inside Sagarmatha National Park — Sagarmatha being the Nepalese name for Everest.
Each day, as we made it a little higher, the air became a little thinner and our breath a little shorter. By day eight, the time between each step I took had grown significantly. I was breathing hard. My feet were dragging and my head pounding. I trudged slowly upward, but upward nonetheless, knowing the goal was within reach.
By mid-afternoon, we hiked across the final ridge and Base Camp came into view. We had made it to the gateway to the top of the world.
Base Camp rests on a massive glacier. I high-fived my group and took in the sight of dozens of yellow tents pitched across the ice, tents belonging to those preparing for their ascent. According to my trekking guide, the glacial terrain changes so rapidly that the expeditioners have to move their tents every two weeks.
We took pictures beside the sign declaring we were there and feasted on dark chocolate almond bark to celebrate. As the afternoon clouds rolled in, we lay back and watched the mountains disappear above our heads. The cheers and squeals of more trekkers arriving filled the air as it began to snow.
It may not have been the top, but it was nonetheless a spot where most people on the planet will never set foot. I feel so lucky to have stood in that very special place, and, as I always do at the end of a hike, I feel so strong knowing it was my own two feet that got me there.

AMSTERDAM: The city of Amsterdam’s latest attempt to rein in the nuisance of over-tourism by banning guided tours of the red light district has run into opposition from some of the people it is intended to protect: sex workers.
The Dutch capital plans to ban such tours, saying they are disrespectful and contribute to congestion in the narrow, canal-side streets where scantily-clad sex workers sit behind windows to attract customers.
The first step in the new policy was taken Monday night in the red light district, with tours banned from 7 p.m.
On a recent Friday night, the problem was clear to see: Tourists bathed in a red glow emanating from the windows and peep shows’ neon lights were packed shoulder to shoulder as they shuffled through the alleys.
But sex workers’ union Proud questions whether banning tours will reduce tourist numbers and argues that guides educate visitors and encourage them to behave more respectfully toward the women.
“It could also be that now there are no guides that people just wander into the area themselves and gawk at the women behind the window and take photos because there is no one anymore to inform them how to behave or what the rules of the game are in this area,” said a sex worker who goes by the name of Velvet and is the advocacy coordinator for Proud. Velvet declined to give her real name, saying that because of the stigma attached to sex work, most sex workers use a working name or pseudonym to protect their privacy and safety.
Amsterdam’s Prostitution Information Center, which is housed in the same building as Proud, offers its own red light district tours.
The total ban on guided tours, which is planned to come into full force on Jan. 1, is another step in the city’s campaign to reduce the problems associated with over-tourism and part of a broader package of measures reining in tours in the city.
Bobien van Aalst of the Dutch tour guide association Guidor slammed the ban on tours, not just to the red light district but to other historic parts of the city. She said it means guides won’t be able to explain to tourists where Rembrandt van Rijn painted one of his first famous works or where the painter’s wife is buried.
“I mean it’s like in Paris if you’re forbidding (tours) to go to the Arc de Triomphe or the Eiffel Tower,” she said.
City Hall says that more than 1,000 tour groups per week now operate around the Old Church Square in the heart of the red light district.
“Yeah, there’s really over-tourism there — too crowded. I mean there were evenings where … residents basically couldn’t leave their homes anymore because the alleys were blocked,” the city’s deputy mayor, Udo Kock, told The Associated Press.
People who work in Amsterdam’s sex industry question whether there are more tourists, or whether similar numbers are squeezing into a red light district that has shrunk in recent years as hundreds of the sex workers’ windows have been shuttered in an attempt to diversify the narrow streets.
Kock acknowledges that not everybody is happy, but says many others are pleased that the city is tackling the tours.
The red light district is a tourist magnet, especially after dark, with crowds of people waiting to get into sex shows and visiting the Red Light Secrets Museum of Prostitution, where you can experience the windows from a sex worker’s perspective by sitting on a stool in front of a “window” onto which images are projected of men walking past and peering in.
The museum’s manager, Natascha Flipsen, agrees that guided tours help educate the visitors not just about the history of the centuries-old red light district, but also about how to treat the women who work there with respect.
And she says that tourism is good for the business.
For tourists, “this is like the once in a lifetime experience, so they visit the sex work as well of course,” Flipsen said.

So, my brother, who lives in the US, was getting married. Arrange a visa, head to the States to attend the wedding — that’s a lot of work. I thought I’d just wish him from here. A few days later, a Viber group was created including me and other children from my maternal family, and all of my mother’s sisters — eight in total. Now the wedding would take place in Bali, Indonesia. Wow a ‘Destination Wedding’!
More excited than ever, I agreed that I was going. So I started saving, and yes the time finally came.
I took leave from office for 10 days, booked the tickets for my mother and me, and started packing. When I left my house and reached the airport, it didn’t feel like I was actually going to Bali, but when I sat on the plane, I realised that my journey had begun. The flight, which was pretty chilled with a couple of beers, was of around four hours to Singapore, our transit point.
Then through tough Singapore security, helped by Starbucks coffee and a coconut drink, we were finally on our way to Bali.
So Bali. What can I say? The first thing that crossed my mind is ‘hot and sweaty’. As we got the hang of the weather, we found our guide, and an hour’s drive to the villa.





The sight along the way was awesome — statues of Hindu deities were around every street and corner. And you could see beautiful hand-carved statues of Ganesha and other deities in the shops, a breathtaking scene, their faith in religion, how they worship the gods.
I later found out that they are so religious that all of Bali was closed for two days for New Year’s prayers a day before we arrived. They meditate and pray at temples and their homes.
The villa was like a dream house with a swimming pool. The first thing I did was leave my baggage and go to a local pub for some chilled beers. The most popular and loved beer was Bintang, which cost 25,000 rupiah a bottle — shocking at first, but I later realised it’s around Rs 200.
People from all over the world, especially Australians come here to surf.
The weather is humid, so you sweat like crazy. It is constant summer with no winter, and even the metrology can’t predict rainfall. So it’s mandatory to spend your day in the pool with yes, chilled beer.
The local food was amazing, and hospitality commendable. The beautiful sunset by the ocean added to our first few days making everything surreal.
We also went for Luwak coffee tasting where they give you different drinks of flavoured tea and coffee, which was all free until you wished to drink the world’s most expensive coffee — Luwak animal poop coffee. The process to extract the poop was amazing using traditional hand method of collection to packing. A small cup cost us around 350,000 million Indonesian rupiah, and to buy a small pack I spent nearly 750,000 million rupiah, a gift for my dad that equals around $80. Crazy right? And it was really strong too.
The monkey temple was cool, more like a jungle with amazing sculptures of deities and filled with monkeys, better looking than the ones from Nepal. More mature looking I must say.
Then we visited the Saroswati Temple famous for its lotus blooms. Most people come for wedding photo shoots.
I also pampered myself to a fish spa for my feet. So ticklish!
Then the big day arrived — everything had to be Nepali style, the groom in a car to the wedding temple to the attire to the wedding dance janti. People were amazed, a few even made attempts to film the wedding.
About 50 guests attended the wedding.
The temple where the wedding was held was a massive one dedicated to Lord Shiva. The rituals were in Sanskrit language and I couldn’t understand any of it! The ritual was short as compared to Nepal, the ceremony concluded in just around two hours.
My brother had hired an amazing wedding planner. The ceremony was for two days — mehendi night at our new villa by the beach with black sand, a Jacuzzi and a swimming pool and breathtaking view of the surfers. The whole night was a blast with no sleep where my phone dived into the pool and died. Sad story but …
The next day was the wedding — early morning ceremony by the ocean and janti in 1940s classic vehicle headed towards the temple where the ceremony took place. The reception took place in the evening where a Balinese fire dancer showcased all kinds of acts and fire tricks. The decoration was beautiful with all the lights reflected by the pool of our villa.
We had heard of the popular Bali swing, so the last day we spent seeing that and other sites and shopping places.
Though we had a few mishaps  — a few had their luggage arriving a day late, one bashed his head swimming at 3:00 am, one broke his leg, my aunt lost $1,200, and I dropped my phone in the pool, it was one heck of a week.
As I write this story, I still feel the wind, the ocean, my family’s laughter and the closeness we felt coming together from different parts of the world for a week, leaving our hectic lives behind to enjoy and be together in a beautiful new place and for such an auspicious occasion. It was an experience of a life time.

CYRENE, LIBYA: Graffiti covers the walls of a Greek amphitheatre in Cyrene, an ancient ruined city in eastern Libya now struggling with neglect, vandals and illegal confiscation of land by locals.
The deserted souvenir shops and cafes on the mountainous road leading to the 2,600-year-old site are the only reminders that this used to be a major tourist destination.
Looting has hit Libya’s archaeological sites since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 when the country descended into turmoil with rival administrations competing for control.
Cyrene is one of five of UNESCO’s World Heritage sites in the North African country listed for their outstanding value. Others include the ruins of the Roman city of Leptis Magna, and Sabratha, both in western Libya.
Apart from Cyrene, some 200 km (124 miles) east of Benghazi, the east of the country has the Apollonia site just 20 km away.
With tourists gone and the antiquities department complaining about budget shortages, vandals have smeared graffiti on columns and looted artefacts.
Some treasures such as heads or entire torsos of statues listed in guidebooks issued in 2011 are no longer there.
“Many artefacts have been smuggled abroad,” said Ahmad Hussein, the head of the antiquities department of a parallel administration in charge of eastern Libya.
Unable to prevent theft, his department has been registering artefacts, a process which has helped to recover some in Europe, he said.
There was better site protection before 2011, but excavation at the site, in fact, dates back to Italian rule — the colonialists’ equipment can still be seen. The last Italians left the east in 1943 following their military defeat when the region came under British administration.
“There has been a lot of destruction in recent years,” said Ismail Miftah, a farmer living next to Cyrene. “Ordinary people don’t appreciate the ancient heritage.”

KATHMANDU: Four Sherpa climbers who got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Mt Makaulu Base Camp in two-metre deep snow in Sankhuwasabha for over a week shared that the high route of the Great Himalaya Trail witnessed an unusual snowfall in this winter season.
Four climbers – Pemba Jangbu Sherps, Darinji Sherpa, Pemba Rinji Sherpa and Pasang Gelu Sherpa were rescued by a Kailash Air helicopter on Monday as they ran out of food in the mountain area while embarking on a trek namely “German Nepal Friendship: The Great Himalaya Trail in Winter”.
It was really an unusual snowfall in the region, one of the team leaders Pemba Jangbu shared.
“We had to to turn around due to heavy snow in the Barun-Valley in Sankhuwasabha this season,” he said, recounting that as this is was a friendship project between Nepal and Germany the crew continued to Barun Dobhan trying to reach the high passes – Sherpani Col 6,110m, West Col 6,100m and Amphu Labtsa 5,700m – to cross into Khumbu.
“This is not only the story of the first ever attempt of the GHT High Route in winter but a story about German-Nepali friendship,” German Geographer Hannes Kuenkel, who is also a leader of the team, added.
This year the crew regrouped and was joined by seven experienced Sherpa – Darinji, Pemba Rinji, Pasang Gelu, Dafuri, Pasang Dawa, Phurba Sonam, Pasang Tendi – from Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Municipality-1, Solokhumbu, German photographer Martin Poetter and Austrian videographer Julia Brunner.
As they started their trek from Olongchun Gola where they had to break up last time and then crossed the snowy Lumbha Samba Pass (5,175m), the team reached Arun Valley on January 11.
“As all routes up to Makulu Base Camp were very difficult we tried the High Route above Hongon up to Malun Pokhari at 4,000m and we had experienced heavy snowfall and up to two feet high snow which made it impossible to hike with heavy loads,”  Kuenkel said.
As the weather was very unpredictable and the route not marked or built the team decided to take their only chance for the High Route by splitting the group in Gadhi on January 19 and sending the four strongest Sherpas led by Pemba Jangbu with only minimum equipment and light packs via Keke La pass (4,100m) towards the high passes while the others returned to Tumlingtar and flew via Kathmandu to Namche to meet up with the crew again, according to him.
The plan was that the Germans met the Sherpa again in Khumbu and together finished the Eastern part of the GHT via the icy Trashi Labtsa Pass (5,777m).
“Unfortunately the weather became worse and the Sherpa team got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Makaulu Base Camp in up to two-metre deep snow and the crew experienced 120 hours of continuous snowfall between January 22 (1pm) and January 28 (1am).”
On January 24, the snowfall stopped for 13 hours but the helicopter could not start from Kathmandu due to bad weather there. Pemba Jangbu who led over 26 expeditions told that he never experienced this kind of snowfall before. “On 28th January, a helicopter rescue was successful. It was just in time as the crew run out of gas and food.”
This winter the extraordinarily heavy snowfall did not allow the team to continue. So the team returned to Kathmandu were they stay together as friends and already prepare plans for a next attempt, according to Kuenkel, who visited Nepal for 15 times.
The two expedition leaders Pemba Jangbu and Kuenkel mentioned that they continued this project for three reasons: to promote trekking in Nepal, make people sensitive for the consequences of global warming and demonstrating how strong and powerful the international friendship can be.
According to team members, Pemba Jangbu, also owner of IAM Trekking & Expeditions and the German Geographer Hannes met during an Everest North Side Expedition which was shattered by the big earthquake in 2015.
In January 2017 they started the first attempt of the GHT High Route in winter. As the eastern part of Nepal has the highest mountains and passes they decided to take that challenge first and go from East to West starting in Taplejung.
They went up to Pangpema BC of Kantschendzonga, crossing the Nango La (4700m) to Olangchung Gola. That year the German became heavily sick in Olangchung Gola and had to give up early.

BANGKOK: Thailand approved marijuana for medical use and research on Tuesday, the first legalisation of the drug in a region with some of the world’s strictest drug laws.
The junta-appointed parliament in Thailand, a country which until the 1930s had a tradition of using marijuana to relieve pain and fatigue, voted to amend the Narcotic Act of 1979 in an extra parliamentary session handling a rush of bills before the New Year’s holidays.
“This is a New Year’s gift from the National Legislative Assembly to the government and the Thai people,” said Somchai Sawangkarn, chairman of the drafting committee, in a televised parliamentary session.
While countries from Colombia to Canada have legalised marijuana for medical or even recreational use, the drug remains illegal and taboo across much of Southeast Asia, which has some of the world’s harshest punishments for drug law violations.
Marijuana traffickers can be subject to the death penalty in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.
But in Thailand, the main controversy with legalisation involved patent requests by foreign firms that could allow them to dominate the market, making it harder for Thai patients to access medicines and for Thai researchers to access marijuana extracts.
“We’re going to demand that the government revoke all these requests before the law takes effect,” said Panthep Puapongpan, Dean of the Rangsit Institute of Integrative Medicine and Anti-Aging.
Some Thai advocates hope that Tuesday’s approval will pave the way for legalisation for recreational use.
“This is the first baby step forward,” said Chokwan Chopaka, an activist with Highland Network, a cannabis legalisation advocacy group in Thailand.

BERLIN: More than 6 million visitors, 7.5 million liters of beer, 124 rotisserie oxen and Bill Clinton in lederhosen; another Oktoberfest in Munich has come and gone.
Festival organizers say good fall weather helped attract 100,000 more people to the annual event than last year; in all, 6.3 million from about 70 countries. That’s despite this year’s Oktoberfest running only 16 days — two fewer than in 2017.
Former US President Clinton and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showed up Friday night — he dressed in traditional Bavarian garb and she in a trademark pantsuit.
Security guards confiscated 101,000 liter-size beer mugs from sticky-fingered guests seeking souvenirs. Munich authorities cleaned up 95 tons of garbage during the festival that ended Sunday.

MEDORA: For travelers looking to visit all 50 states, North Dakota is often one of the last to be checked off. It’s not exactly on the way to anywhere else, and flying there is expensive.
It ended up being 49th on my 50-state quest (sorry, Idaho!). Part of the challenge was deciding what to do there and how to get there. I had to choose between visiting Fargo in eastern North Dakota (and the name of one of my favorite movies) or Theodore Roosevelt National Park in the west.
It’s 330 miles (530 kilometers) between them, and I didn’t have time for both on a week-long road trip that also included Montana’s Glacier National Park and Idaho’s Craters of the Moon.
In the end, Roosevelt Park won out. Photos of its badlands and prairies enchanted me, and the story of Teddy Roosevelt’s sojourn there following the deaths of his wife and mother on the same day intrigued me.
What was it about this place that allowed this future president to grieve and recover — while at the same time inspiring him to become one of America’s most influential conservationists? I needed to see it for myself.
GETTING THERE
My husband and I flew to Denver — by air from New York, the cheapest jumping-off point — and rented a car (unlimited mileage, of course). We then drove 600 miles (965 kilometers) north through Wyoming and South Dakota to the tiny North Dakota town of Medora (population 132), at the entrance to the park’s South Unit.
Fortunately, those 600 miles were easily done in a day, thanks to speed limits of 75 and 80 mph (120-128 kph) in many spots, and little traffic outside Colorado. Still, it felt like we were heading to a pretty remote place, and I wondered if the park would hold its own against national parks I’d visited in Alaska, Hawaii and the Southwest, not to mention Yellowstone and Yosemite.
About 700,000 people visit Roosevelt Park yearly, compared to the more than 3 million annual visitors at places like Montana’s Glacier Park.
THE LOOP AND WILDLIFE
Teddy Roosevelt Park is open 24 hours daily. We arrived at 7:30 a.m. one day at the tail end of last summer. Map in hand, we drove the 36-mile (58-kilometer) scenic loop around the park’s South Unit, stopping at many of the nearly 20 points of interest along the way.
Within minutes, we came upon a prairie dog town. Dozens of the tiny creatures scampered back and forth, popping in and out of little holes amid scrubby grasses. We’d see three more prairie dog towns before we completed the loop, along with wild horses grazing on a hill by the roadside and in another spot, a herd of bison.
The wildlife encounters were thrilling and unexpected surprises.
THE LANDSCAPE
The landscape was thrilling too. The scent of sage perfumed the air, and bursts of red foliage punctuated the gray-green grasslands. Stripes of peach, cream and mud-brown earth and stone lined the curving banks of the Little Missouri River.
Framing it all were the famous badlands stretching to the horizon: flat-topped stone formations with striated slopes in tawny yellows and russet reds, dotted with bright green trees and patches of grass. They looked like the crusty paws of some massive alien creature on the verge of rising up.
We did most of the hikes along the loop drive, some just a few minutes’ walk to an overlook, others 20 to 40 minutes along hilly trails covering a mile or more. At every stop, we were awed by the scenery, from the astonishing palette of earthy hues to the stone shapes etching land and sky.
ROOSEVELT’S STORY
An exhibit at the visitor center tells Roosevelt’s story. On his first visit in 1883, he hunted bison and invested in a ranch near Medora. He’d been a state assemblyman in his native New York, but after his mother and wife both died on Feb. 14, 1884, he left politics and returned to the badlands to mourn his losses.
He lived in a small ponderosa pine cabin now located just steps from the visitor center. It’s furnished with period pieces and some of his belongings, including his traveling trunk, a replica of his writing desk and a rocking chair.
Roosevelt lived the cowboy life, spending days riding and herding in what was considered America’s last frontier. His experiences there were formative: He lost more than $24,000 when blizzards decimated the cattle he’d invested in. He witnessed the environmental damage done by overgrazing. And he realized that the bison, who once roamed the plains in the millions, had dwindled to the hundreds.
Roosevelt wrote three books inspired by his Western sojourn. He eventually returned to politics, serving as New York governor and from 1901-1909, as US president. His accomplishments included the conservation of 230 million acres of land, a legacy that led to the creation of the National Park Service in 1916.
For me, Roosevelt Park ranks among the most interesting and beautiful I’ve seen. I wish I hadn’t waited so long to visit, and I hope someday to go back and absorb more of the place that Roosevelt called “a land of vast silent spaces — a place of grim beauty.”

DENPASAR, INDONESIA: The Indonesian tourist island of Bali closed its international airport Friday, stranding thousands of travelers, as the Mount Agung volcano gushed a 2,500-meter (8,200-feet) column of ash and smoke.
The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said nearly 450 flights were canceled, affecting some 75,000 people.
The regional Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Darwin, Australia, said winds would carry the ash southwest toward Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island. Volcanic ash is a potentially deadly threat to aircraft that can cause engines to “flame out.”
The volcano began belching ash and smoke on Thursday and several airlines canceled inbound and outbound flights scheduled for the evening.
“We hadn’t a place to stay for the night so we had to find something else, just took a taxi and stayed at a random hostel,” said a stranded German backpacker who identified herself as Louisa. “We hoped that we could leave this morning, but the airport is closed,” she said.
Two small airports, at Banyuwangi and Jember in eastern Java, also closed because of the ash threat.
Agung’s alert level has not been raised and an exclusion zone around the crater remains at 4 kilometers (2.5 miles).
The disaster agency said the closure of Bali’s airport is in effect until 7 p.m. It said the situation will be reviewed at midday.
Australia’s national airline Qantas said in a statement that it’s “currently not safe” to operate Bali flights.
It said it was monitoring advice from the ash advisory center and its own pilots and meteorologists would decide when flights can resume.
The volcano, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) northeast of Bali’s tourist hotspot of Kuta, last had a major eruption in 1963, killing about 1,100 people.
It had a dramatic increase in activity last year, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, but had quietened by early this year. Authorities lowered its alert status from the highest level in February.
Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Government seismologists monitor more than 120 active volcanoes.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: Once a pristine Thai paradise, the secluded bay made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie “The Beach” has been exhausted by mass tourism. Now it’s getting a break.
After Friday, the daily influx of dozens of boats and thousands of visitors unsuccessfully scrambling for an unspoiled view of Maya Bay’s emerald waters and glistening white sand will end. The attraction is being closed for four months to give its coral reefs and sea life a chance to recover.
Thailand has promoted unfettered tourism for decades and the onslaught on Maya Bay, which is on Phi Phi Leh Island in the Andaman Sea, has only picked up pace in recent years. Authorities now say they are striving to balance profit and conservation and the closure will happen every year.
It is part of a rethink happening globally about unrestricted tourism that brings in big dollars but damages historic sites, harms the environment and often alienates locals.
Last month, the Philippines began a six-month closure of popular Boracay Island, whose waters President Rodrigo Duterte described as a “cesspool.” Venice, the famed Italian lagoon city that lives off tourism, installed gates at two access bridges during a four-day holiday in April so it could turn back visitors if numbers became overwhelming.
Many of Thailand’s marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October during the monsoon season but because of Maya Bay’s popularity, it hasn’t had a break since a Hollywood crew set foot on its sands in 1999 to film the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland. Its corals have been decimated by the suffocating clouds of sand and sediment churned up by speedboats.
“I tried to push this campaign for many, many years, but you know in Thailand we are a tourism industry country and we need a lot of money, so before not so many people listened,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine biologist and member of a government committee on development and the environment.
“It should have been done 10 years ago but at least it has been done,” he said.
Thailand had about 35 million international visitors last year, a five-fold increase in little more than two decades.
Shi Pengfei, among the last tourists to visit Maya Bay before its closure, said he had no idea that there would be so many people on the beach.
“I feel that there are so many people here,” said Shi, from Henan, China. “The government’s plan to close off the beach for a few months is only natural because the ocean needs a break, a chance to recover, so that the next generation can have a better and even more beautiful destination.”
But locals aren’t entirely happy. The head of the Phi Phi Tourist Business Association, Watrapol Jantharo, said he was surprised when the closure was announced in March by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
He said locals were under the impression that Maya Bay would only be closed to boats, while visitors would still walk to the bay from the other side of the island.
“We are not against protecting our environment,” he said. “We know full well that Maya Bay is our important resource, like a rice field to a farmer, but we wish there are more communications about the government’s plan before the decision was made.”
Thon, however, said the plan was discussed with locals for three years before a decision was made.
“In the past, we made some mistake because we think that the money is very important. But now we are trying to change our idea,” he said. Overseas visitors are “very important to our country, but the most important thing is our national resource. We have to preserve and hand it to the next generation.”
The government has set a limit of 2,000 tourists a day when the bay reopens — about half the current number. Boats will no longer be allowed to anchor but must dock on the opposite side of the island.
“Now that the government has this plan, we can’t change it. But we could use this opportunity to tell the world that we do not just have Maya Bay. There are 10 other beautiful beaches and islands around here that tourists can enjoy,” said Watrapol.
Thailand’s efforts to protect certain islands after decades of unregulated tourism began about three years ago under the current military junta, which has banned the types of protests such moves may have sparked had they been announced by civilian governments.
Yoong Island, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Tachai Island in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off-limits to tourists since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said he was amazed by the results. Waters that were devoid of fish are now teeming, he said, and there is about 10,000 square meters (107,600 square feet) of newly recovered coral off one of the islands.
At Maya Bay, park rangers have been preparing a coral propagation program, attaching it to rocks that will be placed in the bay once the tourists are gone.
“We’re almost certain that something good will happen in Maya Bay,” Thon said.

Ministry of Tourism Secretary Krishna Prasad Sapkota and record 22-time Everest climber Kami Rita Sherpa have been invited to grace the event.
The festival is being organised on the occasion of ‘Everest Day’ on Tuesday.

BANGKOK: The daily hordes of tourists have exhausted the Thai beach made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie.
Maya Bay, on Phi Phi Leh island in the Andaman Sea, will be closed to all visitors for four months annually starting this June to allow for the recovery of the battered coral reefs and sea life. The decision to keep visitors away was made Wednesday by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
“It’s like someone who has been working for decades and has never stopped,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a prominent marine scientist and member of Thailand’s national strategy committee on environment development. “Overworked and tired, all the beauty of the beach is gone. We need a timeout for the beach.”
Many Thai marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October, but because of tourist demand, Maya Bay has remained open year-round since a Hollywood crew set foot there in 1999 to film “The Beach,” the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland.
The beach receives an average of 200 boats and 4,000 visitors each day. Recent surveys by a team led by marine biologists found a large part of the coral reefs around the area is gone and sea life has virtually disappeared.
Other Southeast Asian beach resorts are under threat too.
In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has vowed to close Boracay, a small central island popular for its powdery white sand beaches and vibrant nightlife, saying it has become a “cesspool.”
“Their waste would go directly to the ocean. The germ content is already very high there,” Duterte said last week. “It only looks good because of the white coastline.”
His top environmental officials say Boracay may be closed in the last week of April after a 30-day notice is issued and the tropical island placed under a state of calamity to allow the government to extend emergency funds to affected villagers and establishments.
During the closure, which could last six months or less, a massive cleanup is planned and noncompliant beach resorts and other establishments would have to install waste treatment and disposal systems to halt further contamination. Boracay drew more than 1 million tourists last year mostly from Asia, the United States and Europe.
Boracay officials may face administrative cases for allowing environmental laws to be breached for years and for failing to regulate the influx of tourists beyond the island’s capacity.
Thon said the Thai beach’s temporary closing will kick-start the rehabilitation process.
“If you ask me if it is too late to save our islands, the answer is no. But if we don’t do something today, it will be too late,” said Thanya Netithammakum, head of the National Parks and Wildlife Department.
When Maya Bay reopens, the department will set a daily limit of 2,000 tourists, while boats will no longer be allowed to anchor there and will have to dock on the opposite side of the island at floating piers.
The number of visitors the beach has been seeing is unsustainable, and a temporary closure is better than nothing, Thon said.
“The locals know that and we all know that,” he said. “This would be a good way to start managing our tourist destinations. And we can improve on what we learn after the first year. We know that it’s important we manage our resources well. It’s not about more numbers of tourists but about sustainable tourism that benefit locals as well.”
More than 35 million tourists visited Thailand last year, compared to around 10 million when “The Beach” premiered in 2000.
Thai authorities have in the past closed off islands ruined by mass tourism. Koh Yoong, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Koh Tachai, in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off limits to tourists permanently since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said the results have been amazing. Areas with a bleak sea life environment and coral bleaching are now teeming with robust and colorful sea life and coral, he said. He’s certain that the annual closure will also help restore Maya Bay.
“I have always dreamt that one day we could work to bring her back to life. I have been following and working on Maya Bay for more than 30 years. I had seen it when it was a heaven and I see it when it has nothing left. Anything that we can do to bring this paradise back to Thailand is the dream of a marine biologist,” he said.

IFEROUANE: Tuaregs in northern Niger are hoping to draw tourists back to the region by putting their traditional dances, music poetry and camel races on display.
Despite concerns about Islamic extremism throughout the Sahel region in West Africa, organizers recently hosted more than 1,000 visitors to a cultural festical in Iferouane, a village in Niger’s far north.
“Without tourism, our youth risks falling into idleness and misery, and will join the wave of migration to Europe,” said Mohamed Houma, the mayor of the town located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the central city of Agadez.
The Air festival, considered one of the most important gatherings to celebrate the culture of the Tuareg people, has been held since 2001.
It was marked last month by the sound of tende, the Tuareg style of music and drumming, as the women and men, on foot and on their camels, participated in song and dance competitions.
Since 2001, the gatherings have been held to celebrate the culture of the semi-nomadic Tuareg people. More than 2 million Tuaregs live in the Sahara Desert area, stretching across Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria and Tunisia.
Niger’s Air region, with oases, mountains and sand dunes, has been a destination for adventurous Western tourists since the 1980s and the visitors have been a financial boon for the region. But the tourism has dwindled since the Tuareg rebellion, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, and from the proliferation of armed and extremist groups in the Sahel region.
Security guards watched over the dozen French and Belgian tourists who participated this year’s in Air Festival.
“We are very happy because this festival shows the rest of the world that despite the international geopolitical and security context, we live here in peace, sheltered from the upheavals of some of our neighboring countries,” Houma said.
French tourists to the festival this year included Jacques Maire, a French legislator who heads a France-Niger Friendship group in the French National Assembly.
While the situation in Niger is tense, he said it is not the worst in the region.
“There has always been a strong French appetite for the Sahara,” said Maire. “We must seize every opportunity to recreate tourist flows.”

PHOENIX: Arizona officials on Friday guaranteed that Grand Canyon National Park will remain in full operation if Congress fails to pass a budget and a government shutdown ensues.
Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said the state’s top tourist attraction “will not close on our watch, period.”
Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak says the state’s parks and tourism agencies plan to provide up to $100,000 to ensure lodging, campgrounds and restaurants remain open, and more funding if needed.
The state agencies have been working with the National Park Service to plan for a possible shutdown as early as Saturday if Congress fails to pass a government funding bill. The House passed a temporary government funding bill Thursday night, but the Senate was deadlocked.
President Donald Trump and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer met Friday afternoon in an eleventh-hour effort to avert a shutdown. The impasse is over federal spending and legislation to protect some 700,000 younger immigrants from deportation.
“If Washington, D.C. won’t function, Arizona will,” Ducey said in a statement. “Don’t change your travel plans, because Arizona is open for business — regardless of what happens back in Congress.”
The U.S. Interior Department said national parks and other public lands will remain as accessible as possible if a shutdown happens. That’s a change from previous shutdowns, when most parks were closed and became high-profile symbols of dysfunction.
But spokeswoman Heather Swift said services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds, full-service restrooms and concessions won’t be operating in most locations.
Arizona’s decision to guarantee funding to cover the cost of those services means they should operate at the Grand Canyon as normal if a shutdown occurs.
Arizona paid about $100,000 a day to cover the full cost of keeping the Grand Canyon open during the last shutdown in 2013 but was eventually reimbursed by the federal government. Former Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, worked to pay the National Park Service $651,000 to keep the popular tourist destination open for a week. That came after a shutdown that lasted more than a week.
Federal lawmakers reached an agreement on the budget before those seven days were up.
During a 1995 shutdown, Arizona’s governor famously led a convoy of unarmed troops to the park’s gate to demand it be opened.
They were met there by the park superintendent, who negotiated with then-Gov. Fife Symington, a Republican, for a partial reopening if the budget impasse continued.
The shutdown was briefly solved, but when the parks were again closed a month later, the state paid more than $17,000 a day to keep the road to the Grand Canyon Village and the Mather Point scenic viewpoint on the canyon’s South Rim open.

LAMJUNG: A number of domestic tourists visiting a historical site of Rainaskot in Lamjung district has increased significantly.
Home stay, started after renovation of an earthquake affected houses are now packed with the domestic tourists. It is being run in a total of 14 houses which are built with the modern techniques where 84 tourists can be accommodated at once.
The concept of home stay in Rainaskot begun with American national Natasha Wajniyak providing a fund of Rs 20.75 million to renovate the quake affected houses according to Sarbodaya Old Age Home’s Chairperson Krishna Raj Oliya.
One of the home stay entrepreneurs in Rainaskot, Dilmaya Gurung informed that the domestic tourists are also provided the opportunities of observing the local cultural programs during their stay.
“Besides, tasting the local organic foods, domestic tourists also can experience the local cultures,” said Gurung. Since the Rainaskot has a big Gurung population, a museum related to that caste also has been established.
Meanwhile Rainaskot Tourism Committee’s Chairperson Khadak Bahadur Gurung expressed his hope of attracting even bigger number of the domestic tourists in the future. Visitors can reach the site after two hours of bus ride and three hours of hike from Paudi, a gateway of Lamjung district.
Mesmerizing views of 18 mountain ranges including Annapurna and Machchapuchhre can be seen from the Rainaskot.

MADRID, SPAIN:  A passenger on a delayed Ryanair flight from London who apparently got fed up waiting to get off a plane after it landed in the southern Spanish city of Malaga surprised fellow passengers by using the emergency exit to jump onto a wing.
The incident on New Year’s Day took place 30 minutes after the flight from Stansted Airport landed.
The man, who has not been named but is said to be a non-Spanish citizen, was coaxed back onto the plane while police were called.
Fellow passenger Fernando del Valle Villalobos, who videoed the incident, said he heard the man say he got fed up waiting.
“I was astonished,” del Valle, 25, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
He said the passengers were standing in the aisle waiting to get off the plane when the man “very calmly asked permission to get past, opened the emergency exit, looked out, saw the wing, went back for his back-pack.”
Later, he said the captain came out and asked the man why he had done it and del Valle heard him say clearly that he was sick of waiting inside. The passengers, except the man in question, were kept a further 15 minutes on the plane before being let off.
Police said Wednesday that they have opened a complaint against the man for breaching security.
Ryanair said the incident was now in the hands of Spanish authorities.

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA: While much of the nation shivers in bone-aching cold, people in Alaska’s largest city are basking in warmer weather, jogging in short sleeves, ice-skating in T-shirts or walking dogs while just lightly bundled up.
Anchorage saw an official high of 44 degrees Tuesday, tying the record set in 1981 and 2011. That was warm enough for Patricia Bierer, who was visiting Alaska this winter from Montana.
“I am from the Bitterroot Valley in Montana, and it’s colder there today than it is here in Alaska,” said Bierer, dressed in a pink parka as she strolled with family members around Anchorage’s Westchester Lagoon. “And my children that are there are jealous because I’ve got 40-degree temperatures here.”
National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Kurtz said areas of high and low pressure are working together to push tropical air to the north. But temperatures are expected to begin dropping Tuesday night, and below freezing by Wednesday. That freeze-thaw vacillation should bring slick conditions to the area.
“I jokingly refer to it as freezy, skid stuff,” Kurtz said.
It comes as the weather service issued wind chill advisories and freeze warnings covering a vast area, from South Texas to Canada and from Montana to Maine.

A large swath of the US is freezing under Alaska-like weather, but parts of the nation’s northernmost state itself are basking in balmy conditions. Tuesday’s official temperature hit a record 45 degrees in Anchorage. (Jan. 2)

The unseasonable temperatures brought Anchorage resident Cassandra Sullivan out to walk her pit bull Athena along downtown streets. She said it helped jolt her out of the winter blues.
“For some reason, with the weather out today as it is and just the breeze and the warm air, it kind of brings me out of it,” she said.
Ashley Durst, walking her dog at the downtown lagoon during her lunch break, admitted that the warmer weather was a little unusual because it can be minus-30 this time of the year.
But she doesn’t mind that others are feeling that bite instead. “I just think maybe it’s time they get their little taste of it for a while,” she said with a smile.

LAS VEGAS: Las Vegas welcomed 2018 with fireworks, big-ticket musical acts and unprecedented security in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in US modern history just three months ago.
Law enforcement officers kept a close eye Monday on the estimated 330,000 people who traveled from all over the US and beyond to pack in the Las Vegas Strip and downtown’s Fremont Street. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had every officer working throughout the weekend and was aided by the Nevada National Guard and federal agents.
Rosy-cheeked visitors took selfies and livestreamed the celebration amid temperatures in the mid-40s (4 Celsius), much warmer than most of the US. They wore glittery hats, tiaras and other 2018-themed paraphernalia as they hugged and cheered on the new year.
“One bad incident is not going to deter us from having a good time,” Honolulu resident Pettra Stark, who planned her trip after the Oct. 1 shooting, said while standing underneath the massive video canopy on Fremont Street.
For Stark, the heavy presence of armed officers was reassuring. But not everyone felt the same way, including Adrian Dominguez, who traveled for the festivities with 10 other relatives.
“It’s not pleasant to see so many officers,” Dominguez, a resident of the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Juarez. “They are everywhere.”
The heightened security comes after a high-stakes gambler killed 58 and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below before killing himself.
On Saturday, two security guards were fatally shot while investigating a disturbance at Arizona Charlie’s Decatur, a hotel-casino just west of the Strip. Police said the suspect was hospitalized with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities described it as an isolated incident and assured that it was not terrorism-related.
A roughly eight-minute fireworks display at the top of seven of the city’s world-famous casino-hotels started at the Stratosphere 10 seconds before midnight Monday and continued to Venetian, Treasure Island, Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Aria and MGM Grand. More than 80,000 pyrotechnic firings that illuminated the sky in gold, red and green.
Megastars performed at venues up and down the Strip. The Foo Fighters played at The Chelsea at The Cosmopolitan, Maroon 5 was at the Mandalay Bay Events Center and Britney Spears performed at The Axis at Planet Hollywood.
At a lower-key celebration in downtown Las Vegas’ casino-flanked Fremont Street Experience, bands played under a massive video canopy while visitors danced and sipped giant beers.
Las Vegas police officer Larry Hadfield on Monday said there were no incidents related to the festivities to speak of. The Nevada Highway Patrol on Twitter reported the arrest of two suspected impaired drivers near the Strip.
Police cruisers, dump trucks and other large vehicles blocked key intersections during the night to try to prevent anyone from plowing into crowds.
Strollers, backpacks, large bags, coolers and glass bottles were banned from the Strip for the night. Ticket holders for the celebration on Freemont Street Experienced went through checkpoints where security guards used hand-held metal detectors.
New Year’s Eve is worth an estimated $254.3 million to Las Vegas, according to the city’s Convention and Visitors Authority. More than 97 percent of the destination’s nearly 149,000 hotel and motel rooms were expected to be booked.

Canada is more than just its great mountains, wild moose-spotting road trips and craggy-coast good looks. Its endless variety of landscapes might keep you busy the first few days but what would a traveller look for beyond the great outdoors? Its captivating culture will engulf you; from west to east, a foodie’s paradise your palates would be thoroughly refreshed and thriving cities with their own artistic flair will surprise you. But if you’re looking to weave stories out of adventures for years to come here are a few places that you must check out.

Venture into the woods

If snuggled in a sphere suspended atop the forest canopy of Vancouver Island in the middle of nowhere is what excites you then a visit to the Free Spirit Spheres is a must. It’s part Middle Earth fantasy and part childhood dream, you’ll find large wooden orbs suspended from the trees. Take the spiral staircase and short suspension bridge leading up to them and enter into the sphere to experience nature from a different perspective.
Designed to look vaguely like enormous nuts or seeds, the cedar and spruce spheres borrow from and collaborate with the surrounding environment. The spheres are made of fibreglass and wood, and borrow heavily from sailboat construction methods. Inside the curving walls complete with portholes for windows, space is maximised with fold-out tables and mirrors, curved loft beds and benches, and tiny appliances. Touted as ‘the ultimate tree-house experience,’ these Free Spirit Spheres can be rented overnight.

Brace yourself

Mazes and labyrinths reached its zenith as a form in Renaissance England, more as a device for
entertainment than serious purpose. Today VanDusen Garden in Vancouver is one of only six in North America.
It carries on the tradition of Elizabethan hedge mazes in North America. The maze is made of 3,000 pyramidal cedars — Thuja occidentalis ‘Fastigiata’ to be specific was planted in the autumn of 1981 and slowly grown into the form of the maze one finds today.
Named after local lumber magnate and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen, this garden is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. In addition to the maze, the gardens cover 55 acres and displays plants from around the world. There is an observation terrace from which the less adventuresome visitor can view the maze and the struggles of its confused occupants.

For your eyes only

A book collector’s dream, The Monkey’s Paw in Toronto has the world’s first ‘Biblio-Mat’, a
random book vending machine.  All of the books lining the shelves of Stephen Fowler’s bookstore are ones you couldn’t possibly find anywhere else. He opened The Monkey’s Paw in March 2006 and since then it has been a haven for antiquarians, complete with
medical drawings on the wall and a stuffed crow on a typewriter.
The unusual store, named after a horror short story by author WW Jacobs, has a diverse range of old books. Fowler selects each book to fit these categories: the beautiful, the arcane, the macabre and the absurd. For some its charm may be the custom-made Biblio-Mat, a vending machine that will dispense a randomly selected vintage volume for $2, a surprise you might want to see for yourself.

Fairytale escape

An old world fairytale-land with over 350 fairy folk figurines hidden amongst 800-year old cedars is something that will surely lure you in. Artist Doris Needham and her husband Ernest needed a place to put her hand-sculpted cement creations, so they bought a forest in British Columbia and filled it with enchanted figures from fairytales and nursery rhymes.
When Rogers Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needhams’ unusual haven; one just cannot drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house.
The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage, or a favourite
nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. Take the Nature Walk, a 2-km walk through the lush Canadian forest, where you’ll discover many trees, including an 800-year-old cedar grove. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest tree house in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old
cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.

Jewel in the crown

As their contribution to Montreal’s 1967 World’s Fair Exposition the United States government
commissioned architect, scientist, and well-known genius Buckminster Fuller to design a pavilion for the Canadian exhibition.
Fuller, who popularised, perfected, and named the Geodesic Dome, designed a 20-storey-tall dome in the fashion of his hallmark design to represent the USA. Done in a full two-thirds sphere, rather than the typical half dome, the massive steel structure was seen and admired by over 5.6 million visitors who went into the dome to see exhibits from actual spaceships from the Apollo missions to American works of art.  The dome’s steel skeleton was fitted with a clear acrylic covering, making the structure look like a massive, glittering jewel.
When the fair ended, the pavilion remained, securing the dome’s place in Montreal’s landscape. This relic of the 67 Expo survived fire and ice; it was reopened and was re-purposed as a museum devoted to environmental action. Today the Biosphere of Montreal remains, a sturdy and beautiful example of ‘Bucky’s’ geodesic architecture.

Work of art

Comprised of 15,000 tonnes of snow and 500,000 tonnes of ice, the Hôtel de Glace is a massive undertaking, a stunning yet ephemeral work of art and architecture entirely built of snow and ice. Every winter, this unique hotel is completely redesigned and rebuilt, offering an unforgettable experience in the only hotel of its kind in North America.
Whether for a guided tour, a Nordic overnight stay, a wedding or a private function, the Hôtel de Glace is sure to dazzle visitors with its unique style and spellbinding décor. Guests can choose to enjoy a cocktail served in a glass made of ice or spend the night in one of the 44 theme rooms and suites and relax in the outdoor hot tubs and sauna.
Every inch of the hotel is created out of ice, including the furniture. To make the rooms more liveable, beds are covered with furs, blankets and sleeping bags tested to arctic temperatures. Although you might not get four-star service, the attraction has seduced over a million people around the world since its opening in 2001. Only 4-km from the north end of Québec City
a visit might just add to your Canada experience.  – Compiled

396,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/chinas-xi-says-coronavirus-outbreak-must-be-taken-seriously/,"
BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping said Monday that it’s “extremely crucial” to take every possible measure to combat a new coronavirus that has infected 217 people in the country.
His remarks, cited by state broadcaster CCTV, came the same day that the country reported a sharp rise in the number of people infected by the novel form of viral pneumonia, including the first cases in the capital.
The outbreak comes as the country enters its busiest travel period, when millions board trains and planes for the Lunar New Year holidays.
“The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan and other places must be taken seriously,” Xi said, according to CCTV. “Party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people’s lives and health first.”
They should “ensure that the masses have a quiet, peaceful and joyous Spring Festival,” he added.
Health authorities in the central city of Wuhan, where the viral pneumonia appears to have originated, said an additional 136 cases have been confirmed in the city, which now has a total of 198 infected patients. As of the weekend, a third patient had died.
Five individuals in Beijing and 14 in southern China’s Guangdong province have also been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, state broadcaster CCTV reported Monday evening. A total of seven suspected cases have been found in other parts of the country, including in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in the southwest and in Shanghai.
The outbreak has put other countries on alert as millions of Chinese travel for Lunar New Year. Authorities in Thailand and in Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China.
South Korea reported its first case Monday, when a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the new coronavirus one day after arriving at Seoul’s Incheon airport. The woman has been isolated at a state-run hospital in Incheon city, just west of Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.
At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three US airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.
Videos posted online show people in protective suits checking one-by-one the temperatures of plane passengers arriving in Macao from Wuhan. A man surnamed Yang who works for the Macao Health Bureau confirmed over the phone that such checks are taking place in the southern Chinese region.
Many of the initial cases of the coronavirus were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, which was closed as authorities investigated.
Since hundreds of people who came into close contact with diagnosed patients have not gotten sick, the municipal health commission maintains that the virus is not easily transmitted between humans, though it has not ruled out limited human-to-human transmission.
China’s National Health Commission said experts have judged the current outbreak to be “preventable and controllable.”
“However, the source of the new type of coronavirus has not been found, we do not fully understand how the virus is transmitted, and changes in the virus still need to be closely monitored,” the commission said in a statement Sunday.
Coronaviruses cause diseases ranging from the common cold to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS first infected people in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800. The Chinese government initially tried to conceal the severity of the SARS epidemic, but its cover-up was exposed by a high-ranking physician.
“In the early days of SARS, reports were delayed and covered up,” said an editorial in the nationalistic Global Times. “That kind of thing must not happen again in China.”
“We have made great strides in medicine, social affairs management and public opinion since 2003,” the editorial said.
Xi instructed government departments Monday to promptly release information on the virus and deepen international cooperation.
China has notified and maintained close communication with the World Health Organization and other relevant countries and regions, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular news briefing.
Wuhan has also adopted measures to control the flow of people leaving the city, Geng said.
The virus causing the current outbreak is different from those previously identified, Chinese scientists said earlier this month. Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus include fever, cough, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath.
On the Weibo social media platform, which is widely used in China, people posted prevention advice such as wearing masks and washing hands.
State broadcaster CCTV recommended staying warm, increasing physical activity, eating lightly and avoiding crowded places. Some people said they had canceled their travel plans and were staying home for Lunar New Year.

When his trial opens in the coming days, Harvey Weinstein’s defense team is expected to go on the offensive against the women who have accused him of rape and sexual assault, in part by questioning if they acted like victims afterward.
New York City prosecutors intend to counter with a strategy that’s taken hold since the 2018 retrial of comedian Bill Cosby: calling a sex crimes expert as a witness to dispel assumptions about how rape and sexual assault victims behave after an attack.
In fact, Weinstein’s prosecutors are using the very same expert, Dr Barbara Ziv. She was the first prosecution witness at Cosby’s retrial and is expected to testify early in Weinstein’s trial this month.
Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist who has spent decades working with sex offenders and victims, is likely to be an important potential bulwark against Weinstein’s defense that he had consensual relationships with the two women at the center of the case.
One of the women, who accuses Weinstein of raping her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013, sent him warm emails in the months after the alleged assault.
“Miss you big guy,” said one note.
“There is no one else I would enjoy catching up with that understands me quite like you,” said another.
There was similar evidence at Cosby’s trial that he had remained in contact with some of his victims. Ziv testified that victims frequently avoid or delay reporting assaults to police, often keep in contact with the perpetrator, remember more details over time and differ in their emotional responses.
Cosby’s jury ultimately returned a guilty verdict in the first big celebrity trial of the #MeToo era.
Prosecutors are now rethinking how they try sexual assault cases, especially those involving intimate partners, mentors, work friends and other potentially fraught relationships.
Through experts like Ziv, they can immediately focus the jury’s attention on victim behavior and frame the way jurors hear later testimony. That approach can help prosecutors bust myths and preemptively weaken defense strategies.
“I think that makes sense. It’s basically a quick education for the jury, and it’s true the jury starts to see things through that lens,” said Laurie Levenson, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
In addition to the alleged rape, Weinstein, 67, is charged with sexually assaulting another woman, Mimi Haleyi, in 2006. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
Opening statements are expected as soon as this week, following two weeks of jury selection.
Weinstein’s lead lawyer, former Chicago prosecutor Donna Rotunno, said in a pretrial interview with Vanity Fair that while some women might have regretted having sex with the former producer, “regret sex is not rape.”
She said the email correspondence between Weinstein and both women is evidence that, at the time, neither considered what happened to be a crime.
“I think a woman who is a victim of rape is going to look at that and say, ‘That’s not what rape victims do.’ If you were really raped, this is not what you do,” she said.
Defense attorney Kathleen Bliss took similar aim at Cosby’s accusers in scorching closing arguments in April 2018.
She called trial accuser Andrea Constand “a con artist” and witness Janice Dickerson, one of five other accusers to testify for the prosecution, “a failed starlet” and “aged-out model” who had seemingly “slept with every man on the planet.”
Given the cultural moment, some defense lawyers question that strategy. The goal, they say, should be to discredit accusers without eviscerating them. Eviscerating them could turn off a jury.
In Weinstein’s case, the task is all the more daunting. News reports about his alleged predation of scores of women — from high-profile actresses to production assistants — launched the #MeToo movement in late 2017.
“Of course, a lawyer has to go in there and attack credibility and attack inconsistencies. It’s just how you do it,” said defense lawyer Brian McMonagle, who won a mistrial in the first Cosby trial when the jury deadlocked. “There’s a way to do it without being despicable.”
Traditionally, prosecutors call trial experts toward the end of their case to try to repair any damage done to their witnesses. But in sex assault cases, that may be tough to do once jurors form opinions.
“One of the big differences (at the Cosby retrial) was using the victim expert early in the trial. I think that served to help educate the jury on rape myths and victim behavior,” said Kevin Steele, the suburban Philadelphia district attorney who oversaw both Cosby prosecutions.
The practice isn’t limited to the courtroom.
Experts and victims are also working with police to help them understand victim behavior. They can have the same misconceptions as juries, said former prosecutor Kristen Feden, who gave closing arguments in Cosby’s retrial and now represents sex assault victims in private practice. The police training, she said, “certainly changes the way they investigate.”
Constand, who lives in Toronto, is doing training sessions with law enforcement groups there. She first went to police about Cosby in 2005, a year after the encounter — only to be rebuffed by Steele’s predecessor, who declined to press charges in part because she’d stayed in contact with Cosby and didn’t immediately tell law enforcement.
“I can’t tell them how to prosecute these cases, but I can tell them about the internal experiences, and barriers to reporting,” Constand said in a recent interview.
Cosby, 82, who like Weinstein had scores of accusers, is now serving three to 10 years in prison for drugging and molesting Constand. He’d been a friend and mentor to Constand at Temple University, where she worked for the women’s basketball team and he, a beloved alumnus and campus icon, served on the Board of Trustees.
Rotunno, in Vanity Fair, said the #MeToo movement had gone too far.
“Women may rue the day that all of this started when no one asks them out on a date, and no one holds the door open for them, and no one tells them that they look nice,” she said.
In Levenson’s view, defense lawyers need to focus on the facts to win #MeToo cases.
“If you’re going to attack the witnesses, you better have very good ammunition. You better not be going on stereotypes or assumptions,” she said. “It has to be very specific information that undercuts their credibility. The general smear campaign, I don’t think works anymore.”

Govt faces crisis over shortage of flour supplies
Prices of flour, bread shot up last week
First shipment expected to arrive February 15 -ministry
Exports continued despite poor crop yields in last harvest

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday approved the import of 300,000 tonnes of wheat to relieve a shortage of flour supplies that has created a crisis for the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
Prices of flour and bread shot up last week as the ingredient disappeared from shops and wholesale markets, while bread makers shut in protest at what they called government pressure to sell the staple at controlled prices.
“It is not possible for me to sell bread for eight rupees a piece if I buy flour bags at high prices,” said Sheraz Khan, a shopkeeper in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, next to Islamabad, the capital.
“Gas prices have also shot up multiple times since this new government came into power,” he added estimating that the bill for his gas-powered oven had increased four times.
Pakistan’s energy pricing regulator has proposed yet another hike, which officials say is likely to be approved.
Monday’s import decision was made by the Economic Coordination Council, with the first shipment expected to arrive by February 15, the finance ministry said in a statement, adding that it would wave regulatory duties on the grain, which could be shipped in until March 31.
It was not yet clear from which country or countries Pakistan will import the wheat.
Pakistan exported more than 600,000 metric tonnes of wheat from late 2018 to June 2019, its statistics bureau says. Although the government banned exports in July last year, 48,000 metric tonnes was still sent overseas until October 2019.
Economic experts say it made no sense to export the wheat after poor crop yields in the last harvest, and called for an inquiry into the exports despite the ban.
“Someone made billions,” said opposition party leader Khawaja Asif said, adding that he suspected the wheat crises might be the result of a scam.
Rising wheat prices have drawn sharp criticism of Khan’s government, already under tremendous pressure after a key party in his coalition government quit his cabinet, and other allies also raised questions over the government’s performance.
Pakistan is a mostly agricultural country that normally grows enough to meet the needs of its population.
Opposition parties and some economists have called for an inquiry into why Pakistan needs to import wheat when it was exporting the grain until late last year.

399,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/philippine-volcano-recharging-scientist-says-as-shops-hotels-told-to-keep-shut/,"MANILA: A restive volcano in the Philippines has a high risk of eruption as it is “recharging” with fresh magma and rising emissions of toxic gas, a top scientist said on Monday, while authorities ordered commercial establishments to stay shut.
Earthquakes were still happening at the Taal volcano, which shot giant clouds of ash miles into the air on January 12, and levels of the gas were rising, a sign of magma “recharging” and “resupplying” beneath it, a Philippine vulcanologist said.
“If it reaches the crater, it could cause a strong explosion,” Renato Solidum, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), told DZMM radio.
Authorities have thrown a 14-km (9-mile) exclusion zone around the volcano, with experts saying an eruption could bring a devastating rain of rocks and magma and unleash a tsunami in the lake around it.
Several establishments reopened last week in the tourist resort of Tagaytay after the volcano, 70 km (45 miles) from the capital, Manila, had shown signs of calming, but authorities urged them to heed orders to close.
“We asked them to cease operations so no tourists or locals would be lured to that area,” Epimaco Densing, an undersecretary of the interior ministry, told reporters.
Just 311 meters (1,020 feet) high, Taal is one of the world’s smallest active volcanoes, but it can be deadly, having killed more than 1,300 people in an eruption in 1911.
More than 100,000 people have abandoned homes around the volcano and flocked to evacuation centres after it blanketed homes, schools, and farms with ash.
The education ministry said it was ready to send teachers to run classes for more than 1 million students in nearby towns after displaced people had to be accommodated in some schools.
No deaths have been reported and the volcano‘s impact has proved just a blip for the $330-billion national economy, despite cancelled flights and a day of work lost on January 12 because of a heavy fall of ash in Manila.
Taal has erupted more than 30 times in the past five centuries, most recently in 1977. The Philippines lies on the “Ring of Fire”, a belt of volcanoes girdling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes.

HONOLULU: A Hawaii man with a history of run-ins with police and neighbours was facing eviction when he stabbed his landlord and killed two officers before the house he and two women were believed to be in burned, authorities and neighbours said Sunday.
Police responding to a call for help found a woman who had been stabbed in the leg and resident Jaroslav “Jerry” Hanel, in his 60s, opened fire, killing Officers Tiffany Enriquez, a seven-year veteran, and Kaulike Kalama, a nine-year veteran, Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard said. Police suspect he and two women were inside the house when it caught fire, and Ballard said it could take days for authorities to process evidence and recover any remains.

The fire spread to several other residences, destroying seven homes and leaving multiple others with fire or smoke damage, according to Honolulu fire officials.
The homeowner, Lois Cain, had recently sought to have Hanel evicted, court records showed. A neighbour told The Associated Press she saw Cain being loaded into an ambulance with knife wounds.
Cain’s condition was not immediately confirmed, nor was the suspect’s. Ballard said Hanel did not have any gun permits.
The normally peaceful neighborhood where shots were fired is at the far end of the Waikiki Beach between the Honolulu Zoo and the famed Diamond Head State Monument, a volcanic crater that looms above Honolulu and is popular with tourists and hikers. A regional park is also nearby.
Ian Felix, a Honolulu resident and combat veteran with medical training, told the AP he happened to be walking by when he saw a woman lying on the ground with a pool of blood coming from her leg. He applied pressure until the first police officer arrived and put a tourniquet on it, Felix said. Moments later two more officers arrived, and Felix said he then heard two gunshots.
He and the officer picked up the wounded woman and carried her into a neighbour’s garage across the street, he said.
Neighbours described Hanel as mentally disturbed.
“Defendant does NOT have a Rental Agreement to occupy the premises and Defendant has no ownership interest in said premises,” read a complaint for eviction that Cain filed last week in court. “Despite repeated demands, Defendant has failed and refused to vacate the premises.”
Attorney Jonathan Burge has represented Hanel since 2015 in various disputes with neighbours, including temporary restraining orders that three obtained against him. Hanel, a native of the Czech Republic who used Czech interpreters in court, faced a hearing next week on a charge of misusing 911 services, Burge said Sunday.
Burge said he never knew Hanel to be violent, but that “he’s kind of a quirky guy and had problems.” Hanel believed the government was watching him and tapping his phone, Burge said.
“Maybe that’s what set him off,” he said of the eviction.
Hanel lived for free at the home in exchange for handyman work, Burge said. Cain was supportive of him in his disputes with the neighbours, Burge said, but their relationship had soured lately because Hanel’s dog had died and Cain wouldn’t let him get a new one.
Nearby resident Dolores Sandvold said she heard screaming and gunshots and saw Cain being carried to an ambulance.
Kailua resident John Farmer said the fire spread to his sister’s nearby house, which burned down. He said the resident has been described as paranoid and threatening.
Officials across the state began releasing statements mourning the lost lives, with Gov. David Ige saying, “Our entire state mourns the loss of two Honolulu Police officers killed in the line of duty this morning.”
Police closed several streets nearby and asked the public to avoid the area.
Honolulu City Council member Tommy Waters, who represents East Honolulu and is the chairman of the City Council Public Safety Committee, said he was heartbroken by the attack.
“I am disturbed by the initial reports that the gunman was a troubled individual who terrorised the Diamond Head neighbourhood where this tragedy unfolded,” Waters said.

401,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/iran-has-not-ruled-out-talks-to-end-nuclear-dispute-says-official/,"DUBAI: Iran said on Monday that it had not closed the “door to negotiations” in efforts to resolve a dispute over its nuclear agreement with world powers that has escalated steadily since the United States withdrew from the deal in 2018.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said any further move by Tehran to scale back its commitments to the deal would depend on actions by other parties, after European states triggered a mechanism that could lead to the reimposition of UN sanctions.
Iran has gradually stepped back from its obligations to the 2015 deal, under which Tehran secured sanctions relief in return for limiting its nuclear work, after Washington quit the agreement and then imposed stringent US sanctions.
Britain, France and Germany, also signatories to the pact, triggered a dispute mechanism this month, citing Iranian violations. This starts a diplomatic process that could lead to UN sanctions being reimposed.
“Tehran still remains in the deal … The European powers’ claims about Iran violating the deal are unfounded,” Mousavi told a weekly news conference in Tehran, saying that the “door to negotiations” had not been closed.
“Whether Iran will further decrease its nuclear commitments will depend on other parties and whether Iran’s interests are secured under the deal,” Mousavi said.
US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal and began a policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran, saying he wanted a new deal that would cover nuclear issues, Iran’s ballistic missile programme and Iranian activities in the Middle East.
Britain has said a “Trump deal” could replace the 2015 agreement and France has called for broad talks to end a crisis with the United States, which briefly erupted into tit-for-tat US-Iranian military action this month.
Mousavi repeated Iran’s rejection of a “Trump deal”. Iranian officials have said Trump could not be trusted, so such deal would not have any value.

Shipments of unwanted rubbish have been rerouted to Southeast Asia since China banned the import of plastic waste in 2018, but Malaysia and other developing countries are fighting back.

Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin said another 110 containers are expected to be sent back by the middle of this year.
Yeo said the successful repatriation of a total 3,737 metric tonnes (4,120 U.S. tons) of waste followed strict enforcement at key Malaysian ports to block smuggling of waste and shuttering more than 200 illegal plastic recycling factories.
Of the 150 containers, 43 were returned to France, 42 to the United Kingdom, 17 to the United States, 11 to Canada, 10 to Spain and the rest to Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Portugal, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Lithuania, her ministry said.
She said the Malaysian government didn’t pay a single cent, with the costs of sending back the waste fully borne by the shipping liners and companies responsible for importing and exporting the waste.
Yeo said talks were ongoing with U.S. authorities to take back another 60 containers this year. Canada also has 15 more containers, Japan 14, the U.K. 9 and Belgium 8 from 110 more containers that are still being held at Malaysian ports, she said.
“If people want to see us as the rubbish dump of the world, you dream on,” Yeo told reporters during inspection at a port in northern Penang state.
Yeo said the government will launch an action plan on illegal plastic importation next month that will help the different agencies coordinate enforcement and speed up the process of returning the waste.
“Our position is very firm. We just want to send back (the waste) and we just want to give a message that Malaysia is not the dumping site of the world,” she added.

Meeting comes as Haftar forces blockade major oilfields
Libya’s output set to fall to 72,000 bpd from 1.2 mln –NOC
Libya has had two rival governments for over five years
Has been plagued by lawlessness since Gaddafi toppled 

BERLIN: Foreign powers agreed at a summit in Berlin on Sunday to shore up a shaky truce in Libya, but the meeting was overshadowed by blockades of oilfields by forces loyal to commander Khalifa Haftar that could cripple the country’s crude production.
Haftar, whose self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) is bearing down on the capital, Tripoli, with the backing of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Russian mercenaries and African troops, attended the one-day summit in the German capital despite having abandoned talks over a ceasefire last week.

Turkey has rushed troops to Tripoli, as well as Turkish-backed fighters from Syria, to help Libya’s internationally recognised government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj resist eastern commander Haftar’s assault.
Although there has been a lull in air strikes and less fighting over the past 10 days, heavy exchanges of artillery fire could be heard from some front lines south of Tripoli late on Sunday, residents said.
Libya has had no stable central authority since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown by NATO-backed rebels in 2011. For more than five years, it has had two rival governments, in the east and the west, with streets controlled by armed groups.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters that the Berlin summit, attended by the main backers of the rival Libyan factions, had agreed that a tentative truce in Tripoli over the past week should be turned into a permanent ceasefire to allow a political process to take place.
A special committee made up of five military officials from each side will monitor the truce, she said. Foreign powers active in Libya have committed themselves to uphold an existing U.N. arms embargo and stop shipping weapons there, she added.
Serraj and Haftar did not meet in Berlin, Merkel said, highlighting the gulf between the two.
“We know that we have not solved all of Libya’s problems today but we were aiming for fresh momentum,” she said.
Haftar, the east’s most powerful figure, has won backing from a range of foreign allies for an assault to capture Tripoli in the west, while Turkish support for Tripoli’s effort to repel him has turned the conflict into a proxy war. More than 150,000 people have been displaced by the fighting for the capital.

OIL OUTPUT TO TUMBLE ‘IN DAYS’
Haftar quit a Turkish-Russian summit a week ago and escalated the conflict on Friday when eastern oil ports were shut down. Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said the shutdown was directly ordered by Haftar’s forces.
On Sunday, NOC said the major southwestern fields of El Sharara and El Feel were closing after forces loyal to Haftar shut a pipeline.
The closures will cut Libya’s oil output to 72,000 barrels a day (bpd) from 1.2 million bpd in just a few days’ time unless the blockages are lifted, the NOC said.
Any lasting closure could hit Tripoli hard since the government relies on oil revenues to fund its budget.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was very worried about the closure. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Serraj and Haftar had “in general” agreed to solve the output blockage, without giving a time frame.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that progress had been made towards reaching a full-fledged ceasefire in Libya’s war, adding that he hoped Libyan oil facilities would reopen as a result of the talks.
The east under Haftar has tried to export oil, bypassing the NOC, to gain a greater share of oil revenues.

UNWILLING TO LAY DOWN ARMS
A call for a ceasefire from Russia and Turkey helped reduce fighting a week ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said ahead of a meeting with Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of the conference.
“We don’t lose hope that dialogue will continue and the conflict will be solved,” Putin said.
Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio called the summit a “point of departure” for achieving a ceasefire and blocking a flow of arms into Libya that has accelerated with Haftar’s offensive.
Italy, the former colonial power, has a particular interest in Libyan security as the main destination of hundreds of thousands of African migrants sent across the Mediterranean by smugglers until a sharp downturn in flows in 2017.
But since the NATO bombing campaign that helped overthrow Gaddafi, Western countries have stepped back from playing a decisive role in Libya, allowing Russia, Turkey and Arab states to take the lead as outside powers with the most clout.
Pompeo and European and Arab leaders attended the summit, and Haftar’s forces published pictures of him meeting Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash tweeted on Sunday night that the UAE supported efforts by the Berlin conference to seek a political solution to the crisis in Libya.
Both Serraj and Haftar met Merkel on different occasions. Serraj could be also seen hugging Erdogan, while Macron and Haftar were both seen smiling in pictures when they met in a corridor.

JAKARTA: A footbridge across a river swollen by heavy rains collapsed on Indonesia’s island of Sumatra, drowning at least nine people who were swept away by a strong current, with one person missing, disaster mitigation officials said.
Seventeen people were rescued at the site of Sunday’s collapse in the province of Bengkulu, where Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency has launched a rescue effort, its spokesman, Agus Wibowo, said.

A crowd of about 30 people, mostly students, gathered on the bridge could have caused a strain leading to the collapse, Wibowo told Reuters.
“They were watching the floods in the river below and then the bridge snapped, so they fell into the overflowing river,” he added.
A strong current in the river had swept away the victims, drowning them, regional disaster official Ujang Syafiri said in comments to state news agency Antara, adding that the bridge was mostly used by farmers living nearby.
“Since last night, the regional disaster mitigation agency, the military, the police, related organizations, and volunteers had been searching for the missing,” Wibowo said in a statement on Monday.

The comments were Harry’s first public remarks since his split from the royal family was announced earlier this month. Video of his speech was posted to Harry and Meghan’s official Instagram account.
Harry said he did not make the decision lightly and praised his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and the rest of his family for supporting him and his wife in recent months. He called the decision “a leap of faith” and said he hopes the move will allow him and his family to achieve a “more peaceful life.”
During his speech at a charity event, Harry framed the decision as being at least in part because of press scrutiny, saying the “the media is a powerful force.”
He said that he and Meghan intend to continue a life of service and that his love and support for the United Kingdom is unwavering, but added that he needed to shed the royal ties he grew up with.
“We’re not walking away, and we are certainly not walking away from you,” Harry said. “Our hope was to continue serving the queen, the commonwealth and my military associations but without public funding. Unfortunately, that wasn’t possible.”
Harry and Meghan plan to spend most of their time in Canada. Beginning this spring they will stop using their “royal highness” titles and will lose all access to public funds once they stop carrying out official functions.
Harry made the remarks at a dinner to support Sentebale, his Africa-based charity supporting youngsters with HIV. He opened his speech noting that many in the audience had watched him grow up and said he wanted them “to hear the truth from me, as much as I can share, not as a prince, or a duke, but as Harry.”
Harry framed the decision to leave as his own, made on behalf of Meghan and their young son, Archie. He said that Meghan shares his values and remains “the same woman I fell in love with.”
He spoke of both during his remarks, telling the audience that Archie had seen snow for the first time a few days ago and “thought it was bloody brilliant.”
He then turned to his relationship with the queen and other members of his family.
“I will always have the utmost respect for my grandmother — my commander in chief — and I’m incredibly grateful to her and the rest of my family for the support they have shown Meghan and I over the last few months,” he said.

The Daxing health commission in the capital Beijing said it had confirmed two cases of coronavirus, while the southern Guangdong province’s health commission confirmed one case in Shenzhen. They mark the first cases in China beyond the central city of Wuhan where the virus first emerged.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 136 new cases of pneumonia caused by the coronavirus strain had been found in the city over the weekend, adding to 62 already known cases. A third death occurred on Saturday, the authority said in a statement.
This brings the total number of known cases worldwide to more than 200, underscoring the challenge for health authorities seeking to contain the outbreak.
Hundreds of millions of Chinese tourists will be traveling domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday period that starts later this week.
A report by London Imperial College’s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis estimated that by Jan. 12 there were 1,723 cases in Wuhan City with onset of related symptoms. Chinese health authorities have not commented directly on the report.

Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travelers from Wuhan. Outside China, two cases have been reported in Thailand and one in Japan, all involving people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city.
The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.
Its symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for screening efforts.
China’s National Health Commission said on Sunday it will step up prevention efforts, but acknowledged it still doesn’t know the source of the virus.
Shares in pharmaceutical firms and mask makers in China surged Monday because of the outbreak.
The outbreak was one of the top trending topics on Chinese social media platform Weibo, where many users expressed concerns about their safety.
“Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?,” one user said.
China’s Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper, said in an editorial the government needs to disclose all information and not repeat the mistakes made with SARS. Chinese officials covered up the SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumors forced it to reveal the epidemic.
“Concealment would be a serious blow to the government’s credibility and might trigger greater social panic,” the editorial said.

408,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/australias-flame-scarred-kangaroo-valley-calls-for-tourists-to-return/,"KANGAROO VALLEY: Hard-hit businesses in Australia’s blaze-ravaged Kangaroo Valley are calling for tourists to return now that the wildfires are under control, and fear firms and jobs will be lost unless the all-clear message is heard.
The tourism industry estimates the fires that raged throughout the holiday season have already cost it almost A$1 billion ($688 million).
Kangaroo Valley, a wildlife haven 150 kms (93 miles) south of Sydney, was badly affected as video of blazing forests went global and scared away holidaymakers both from home and abroad.
Now, several days of rain and a break in the heat wave have reduced the number of active fires across the country’s densely populated southeast.
“A lot of tourists were told not to come because of the bushfires risk,” says Andi Csantos, a resident who is organizing a fundraising dinner for the town.
“That risk is now totally over. And it’s really important that people come and support our community so that our businesses can continue.”
Traditionally the weeks starting from November to New Year are the busiest time for the area, which lost more than 30 homes to the flames.
“I just have to have faith and help (to) actually support my employees,” says restaurant owner, Monique Moul, who has seen business halve in the last few weeks.
In the town center flanked by dozens of wooden single-storey shops and houses, holidaymakers have slowly started to make their way back.
“The quicker we come back to support them, then they will survive. If not, some may not do so,” said Sam Thoma, a traveler from Sydney.
Australia’s government over the weekend pitched in with millions in aid for the tourist industry, which accounts for more than 3% of the country’s annual economic output and one in every 13 jobs.
While rain and cooler weather in recent days have eased the fire risk, authorities warn hotter conditions are set to return later in the week.

KIEV: The bodies of the 11 Ukrainian citizens who died when a passenger plane was accidentally shot down by Iran this month were brought back to Ukraine on Sunday in a solemn ceremony at Kiev airport.
All 176 on board the Ukraine International Airlines flight from Tehran to Kiev were killed when the Boeing 737-800 was shot down on Jan. 8, at a time when Iran was on high alert for a US attack.

Most of those on board were Iranians or dual nationals. Canada had 57 citizens on board. Nine of the Ukrainian citizens were crew members.
With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy looking on, coffins draped in the Ukrainian flag were carried one by one from a Ukrainian military plane to a waiting hearse at Kiev’s Boryspil airport.
Soldiers held up flags to represent the different nationalities of those who died.
Relatives came to the airport carrying bunches of flowers. Airline staff, some in tears, were waiting on the tarmac.
Iran announced on Saturday it would send the black boxes to Ukraine to be decoded, but did not say when this would happen. Iranian representatives are expected to travel to Ukraine this coming week.
The plane disaster sparked unrest in Iran and added to international pressure on the country as it grapples with a longrunning dispute with the United States over its nuclear programme and its influence in the region that briefly erupted into open conflict this month.

410,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/hong-kong-police-fire-tear-gas-as-thousands-rally/,"HONG KONG: Hong Kong police fired tear gas Sunday at a public park that was overflowing with thousands of protesters calling for electoral reforms and a boycott of the Chinese Communist Party.
Sporting their movement’s trademark black clothing and face masks, rally participants packed into Chater Garden, not far from the Chinese territory’s Legislative Council building. They held up signs that read “Free Hong Kong” and waved American and British flags.

A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997. While the framework of “one country, two systems” promises the city greater democratic rights than are afforded to the mainland, protesters say their freedoms have been steadily eroding under Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Frictions between democracy-minded Hong Kongers and the Communist Party-ruled central government in Beijing came to a head last June, when proposed extradition legislation sparked months of mass demonstrations.
The bill — which would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial — has since been withdrawn, but protests have continued for more than seven months, centered around demands for voting rights and an independent inquiry into police conduct.
While the protests began peacefully, they increasingly descended into violence after demonstrators became frustrated with the government’s response. They feel that Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has ignored their demands and used the police to suppress them.
Demonstrators have routinely thrown bricks and gasoline bombs at riot police, who have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and — on rare occasions — live rounds.
The months of unrest have sent the financial hub’s economy reeling, as shops have shuttered during clashes and tourists have stayed away.
Hong Kong police gave approval for Sunday’s rally, but not for a march that organizers were also planning.
Protesters used bricks, umbrellas and traffic barriers to barricade a road. They ran for cover after riot police appeared around Chater Garden and raised yellow warning flags, telling demonstrators that they should disperse because they were participating in an illegal assembly.
Two officers were bleeding from the head after a group of “rioters” attacked them with wooden sticks, police said in a statement, adding that some also lobbed water bottles and other objects at law enforcement. Others threw paint bombs at buildings in the Central business district, according to police.

411,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/having-fled-bombing-syrian-children-learn-to-read-in-tent-schools/,"AZAZ: Syrian teacher Ahmad al Hilal listens to his young pupils sitting on a mat reciting the Arabic alphabet in a makeshift school in a tent on the outskirts of a sprawling refugee camp city along the Turkish border.
Many ran for their lives with their mothers under heavy aerial bombing by Syrian and Russian jets that paralyzed day-to-day life and damaged dozens of schools and hospitals.

Now, already enduring the difficult winter conditions in the camp, where many tents get flooded, the children huddle on the floor, learning how to read with scraps of paper and pencils.
“These kids suffer from illiteracy. They don’t read or write. They have no one to help them,” said Hilal, who teaches over 140 young Syrians in three tents scattered across several large overcrowded camps on the outskirts of the border town of Azaz.
Women and children form a majority of more than 350,000 people who have fled the renewed assault since December that has pushed deeper into the Syria’s opposition-run bastion in the northwest, according to the United Nations.
“We came here as refugees, there are no more schools because of the air strikes, so we haven’t been going to school but we’re studying in the camp here,” said 14-year-old pupil Khaled, who did not give a family name.

Hilal was himself uprooted from his town of Abu Dahur in Idlib province after the army, backed by pro-Iranian militias seized it.
“We bought some books and parts of the Koran and now teach them inside the camp,” said Hilal, 48, who was a teacher before the conflict that began almost nine years ago.
The U.N. children’s agency UNICEF has warned that the war will leave a generation who have never enrolled in school, having a devastating toll on education, with 7,000 schools destroyed and about 2 million children out of class.
At a nearby camp in al Bab, volunteers have converted a school bus into the Bus of Knowledge classroom.
Inside the decorated bus around 50 girls and boys as young as five take lessons in maths, life skills, Arabic and religion.
“Children are unable to go to the schools in the city. So we at the bus come to them with knowledge and provide them with the learning essentials such as reading and writing and basic mathematics,” said Mawiya Shular, 32, who fled a former rebel-held enclave in Homs three years ago.
“The feeling of being displaced gives me the motivation to work with these children. I want to get children out of their sense of alienation” said Shular, also a family counselor.

412,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/fire-at-czech-home-for-disabled-kills-eight/,"PRAGUE: Eight people were killed and 30 were injured in a fire early on Sunday at a Czech home for people with disabilities, fire and rescue officials told public broadcaster Czech Television.
The fire occurred in Vejprty on the country’s northwest border with Germany in a home where mostly men with mental and other disabilities lived.
It was the second deadliest blaze in the country’s three-decade post-communist history. In 2010, a fire in an abandoned building often used by homeless people in Prague killed nine people. A hotel fire in the capital in 1995 killed eight.

Prime Minister Andrej Babis called the fire “a terrible tragedy”, saying on Twitter that police and firefighters were doing their utmost.
The cause of the fire was not yet known.

413,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/over-1000-gather-in-central-hong-kong-park-to-call-for-democracy/,"HONG KONG: Hundreds of protesters in China-ruled Hong Kong gathered in a central park on Sunday to call for democratic reforms and denounce communism, as police stopped and searched people on nearby streets and in metro stations.
The “Universal Siege Against Communism” demonstration was the latest in a relentless series of protests against the government since June, when Hong Kongers took to the streets to voice their anger over a now-withdrawn extradition bill.
The protests, which have since broadened to include demands for universal suffrage and an independent investigation into police handling of the demonstrations, have lost some of their intensity in recent weeks.
In an apparent new tactic, police have been showing up ahead of time in riot gear, with officers conducting “stop and search” operations near expected demonstrations. A water canon truck and armoured jeeps were also visible on central streets on Sunday.
“Everyone understands that there’s a risk of stop-and-search or mass arrests. I appreciate Hong Kong people still come out courageously, despite the risk,” said organiser Ventus Lau.
Lau initially applied for a permit for a march, but the police only gave a greenlight for a static rally instead, saying previous marches have turned violent.
On January 1, a march of tens of thousands of people ended with police firing tear gas to disperse crowds.
At Sunday’s rally, more than one thousand people gathered in a park surrounded by some of Hong Kong‘s tallest skyscrapers, chanting pro-democracy slogans as they listened to speeches by activists.
Youngsters, dressed in black and covering their faces, mixed with older people and families with children and the atmosphere was relaxed.
In one corner, a group of volunteers set up a stand where people could leave messages on red cards for the lunar new year to be sent to those who have been arrested. One read: “Hong Kongers won’t give up. The future belongs to the youth”.
Authorities in Hong Kong have arrested more than 7,000 people, many on charges of rioting that can carry jail terms of up to 10 years. It is unclear how many are still in custody.
Anger has grown over the months due to perceptions that Beijing was tightening its grip over the city, which was handed over to China by Britain in 1997 in a deal that ensured it enjoyed liberties unavailable in the mainland.
Beijing denies meddling and blames the West for fomenting unrest.

Al Ekhbariya television quoted sources as saying the attack was carried out with ballistic missiles and drones.
A proxy war has been playing out in Yemen between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
The Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which the Houthis ousted from power in the capital Sanaa and is now based in the southern port city of Aden.
The Houthis, who hold Sanaa and most of Yemen’s big urban centers, deny being puppets of Iran and say they are fighting a corrupt system.
Houthis militants did not immediately claim responsibility for Saturday’s attack.

415,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/mexico-blocks-hundreds-of-migrants-from-crossing-border-span/,"CIUDAD HIDALGO: Mexican authorities closed a border entry point in southern Mexico on Saturday after thousands of Central American migrants tried to push their way across a bridge spanning the Suchiate River between Mexico and Guatemala.
Honduran migrants waved their country’s flag and sang the national anthem as they approached the bridge. At the height of the confrontation, Guatemalan authorities estimated 2,500 migrants were on the bridge, or attempting to get on it.

Mexican National Guardsmen slammed down a metal fence that reads “Welcome to Mexico” to block the path of the migrants.
Babies cried and tempers flared as the crowd swelled. Amid shoves, Mexican officials did allow a few migrants to enter the country in groups of 20, while a voice over a loudspeaker warned migrants against trying to slip into Mexico without passing through immigration filters.
Piecemeal, more than 150 migrants entered to apply for asylum or some other variation of permission to stay in Mexico as the day wore on. But many migrants prefer to pass through Mexico en route to the United States.
Mexico again finds itself in the role of immigration enforcer as Central Americans desperate for a better life try to make their way north, while Mexico’s biggest trade partner — the United States —insists that Mexico prevent those migrants from reaching the U.S. border.
Mexico’s National Migration Institute said via Twitter on Saturday that it had reinforced multiple points along the country’s southern border to assure “safe, orderly and regular immigration.” It also said it was using drones to monitor the region.
Hundreds of guardsmen lined the river to prevent migrants from crossing into Mexico clandestinely. The voice on the loudspeaker warned, over and over, that those aiming to transit through Mexico may not be granted asylum in the U.S., even if they make it there.
As temperatures rose Saturday, migrants trickled back across the bridge to Guatemala. By late afternoon, fewer than a hundred remained on the bridge.
Marvin Aguirre, 33, was one of the few who remained on the span. He stretched a sheet across metal poles on the bridge to protect his family from the afternoon sun as they mulled their options. The family would like to start a new life in Mexico, he said, but they fear Mexican authorities will deport them.
Aguirre set out from the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on Tuesday with three children, his wife and a baby granddaughter. “This is hard, especially with the children,” he said. “But there in Honduras, there’s nothing to do. Everything is burned. There’s no work.”
Mexico’s government has said migrants entering the country without registering will not be allowed to pass from its southern border area. But those seeking asylum or other protections will be allowed to apply and legalize their status in Mexico.
Guatemalan officials have counted roughly 3,000 migrants who registered at border crossings to enter that country in recent days, and estimated there were an additional 1,300 migrants who did not register. The Guatemalan government is offering to return migrants by bus to their countries of origin.
Guatemala’s human rights defender’s office said there were more than 1,000 migrants gathered at another point on the Mexican border far to the north in the Peten region. There were reports that Mexican forces were gathered on the other side of the border there.
Vicente Hernández, head of the Mexican armed forces in the border area, told migrants on the Guatemalan side of the Suchiate on Saturday that “there are opportunities for everyone” in Mexico.
“Here you just have to register,” he added, saying that Mexican officials would then offer the migrants jobs.
Mexico’s offer of legal status and potential employment for migrants carries a stipulation that would confine migrants to southern Mexico, where wages are lower and there are fewer jobs than elsewhere in the country.
El Salvador’s consul general in Mexico, Antonio Azúcar, told The Associated Press that Mexican authorities had reported that the migrants crossing into Mexican territory would be housed in Ciudad Hidalgo, the city on the banks of the Suchiate where the bridge standoff happened.
But a Mexican official, who refused to be quoted by name, said those who request asylum in Mexico would be taken to one of two migratory stations in the state of Chiapas — one in Tapachula and the other in Tuxtla Gutiérrez.
Once in custody, in theory, migrants may request temporary work permits to remain in Mexico. For months, however, non-profit groups have complained that the migrants are instead often returned to their countries of origin.
And many of the migrants aim for a new life in the U.S. — not in Mexico.
“We are going to walk all the way up,” said Jazmín González, a 23-year-old Salvadoran clutching a small girl.
González said she feared being deported as she turned herself over Saturday to Mexican authorities, alongside her daughter and three other family members.
Lourdes Geraldina Jiménez of Honduras also decided to trust in the assurances of Mexican officials as she entered Mexico with a son and another family member.
Jiménez said she left Honduras because gang members wanted to kill her 14-year-old son.
“I can’t return to Honduras,” she said, walking next to her son.
Many of the migrants leaving Central America say they fear for their lives back home, while others say they are looking for better economic prospects.

In total, 62 cases of the novel coronavirus have been identified in the city of Wuhan, where the virus appears to have originated. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported the new cases in a statement Sunday.

Nineteen of those individuals have been discharged from the hospital, while two men in their 60s — one with severe preexisting conditions — have died from the illness. Eight are in critical condition.
At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three US airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China. The list includes Thailand and Japan, which have together reported three cases of the disease in people who had come from Wuhan.
In the most recently diagnosed group, ages ranged between 30 and 79, Wuhan’s health commission said. Their initial symptoms were fever and cough.
The health commission’s statement did not say whether these patients had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which has been suspended after many infected individuals reported having either worked at or visited the venue.
Li Gang, director and chief physician of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state broadcaster CCTV that “the infectivity of the new coronavirus is not strong.” Infectivity refers to how rapidly the virus may spread between individuals.
Most patients are experiencing mild symptoms, Li said, and no related cases have been found in more than 700 people who came into close contact with infected patients.
This “does not rule out the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission, but the risk of continuous human-to-human transmission is low,” Li said. “With the implementation of our various prevention and control measures, the epidemic can be prevented and controlled.”
The Chinese government is keen to avoid a repeat of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, another coronavirus that started in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800 people.

417,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/thousands-gather-for-womens-march-rallies-across-the-us/,"WASHINGTON: Thousands gathered in cities across the country Saturday as part of the nationwide Women’s March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration.
Hundreds showed up in New York City and thousands in Washington, D.C. for the rallies, which aim to harness the political power of women, although crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. Marches were scheduled Saturday in more than 180 cities.

The first marches in 2017 drew hundreds of thousands of people to rallies in cities across the country on the day after President Donald Trump was inaugurated. That year’s D.C. march drew close to 1 million people.
In Manhattan on Saturday, hundreds of people gathered as part of a “Rise and Roar” rally at separate events in Foley Square and Columbus Circle.
“Today, we will be the change that is needed in this world! Today, we rise into our power!” activist Donna Hylton told a cheering crowd in Foley Square.
Snow began falling by the afternoon in Manhattan, apparently putting a damper on plans for the two groups to converge in large numbers near Times Square.
In downtown Los Angeles, thousands of men, women and children filled several blocks as they made their way from a plaza to a park adjacent to City Hall, where a rally featured speeches by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Mayor Eric Garcetti, Rep. Maxine Waters and others.
Jennifer Siebel Newsom credited women for mobilizing against gun violence, creating the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and discrimination, and taking back the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.
“In 2020, I have no doubt that it will be women who will lead again, rise up and move this country forward on a path toward justice,” she said.
In Denver, organizers opted to skip the rally after the march and instead invited participants to meet with local organizations to learn more about issues such as reproductive rights, climate change, gun safety and voting.
Several thousand came out for the protest in Washington, far fewer than last year when about 100,000 people held a rally east of the White House. But as in previous years, many of the protesters made the trip to the nation’s capital from cities across the country to express their opposition to Trump and his policies. From their gathering spot on Freedom Plaza, they had a clear view down Pennsylvania Avenue to the U.S. Capitol, where the impeachment trial gets underway in the Senate next week.
In Washington, three key issues seemed to galvanize most of the protesters: climate change, immigration and reproductive rights.
“I teach a lot of immigrant students, and in political times like this I want to make sure I’m using my voice to speak up for them,” said Rochelle McGurn, 30, an elementary school teacher from Burlington, Vermont who was in D.C. to march. “They need to feel like they belong, because they do.”
Peta Madry of New London, Connecticut, was celebrating her 70th birthday in D.C. by attending her fourth Women’s March with her sister, Cynthia Barnard, of San Rafael, California. Both women were wearing handknitted pink hats that date from the first march. With pained expressions, they spoke about Trump’s determination to reverse the policies of his predecessor Barack Obama and his treatment of women.
“Look what he’s doing to Greta Thunberg,” Madry said, referring to the teenage climate activist. “He’s the biggest bully in the world.”
Melissa McCullough of Georgetown, Indiana, said when she recently turned 50 she promised herself that she would get more involved politically. “I’m here to protest Trump, as a woman,” she said.
Her daughter, 19-year-old University of Cincinnati student Elizabeth McCullough, chimed in to say that most women’s issues are human issues, and they talked about the need to protect immigrants.
“You have to push to protect everyone or no one’s safe,” Melissa McCullough said.
The protesters planned to march around the White House, but Trump wasn’t there. He is spending the holiday weekend at his resort in Florida.
Organizers of the Washington march faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize.
“Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that,” Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter this week to Women’s March organizers. “Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.”

418,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/harry-meghan-to-quit-royal-jobs-give-up-highness-titles/,"



LONDON: Goodbye, your royal highnesses. Hello, life as — almost — ordinary civilians.
Prince Harry and wife Meghan will no longer use the titles “royal highness” or receive public funds for their work under a deal that lets the couple step aside as working royals, Buckingham Palace announced Saturday.
Releasing details of the dramatic split triggered by the couple’s unhappiness with life under media scrutiny, the palace said Harry and Meghan will cease to be working members of the royal family when the new arrangements take effect in the “spring of 2020.”
The radical break is more complete than the type of arrangement anticipated 10 days ago when the royal couple stunned Britain with an abrupt announcement that they wanted to step down. They said they planed to combine some royal duties with private work in a “progressive” plan, but that is no longer on the table.

Harry and Meghan will no longer use the titles His Royal Highness and Her Royal Highness but will retain them, leaving the possibility that the couple might change their minds and return sometime in the future.
Harry’s late mother, Diana, was stripped of the Her Royal Highness title when she and Prince Charles divorced.
They will be known as Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Harry will remain a prince and sixth in line to the British throne.
The agreement also calls for Meghan and Harry to repay 2.4 million pounds ($3.1 million) in taxpayers’ money spent renovating a house for them near Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage. The use of public funds to transform the house’s five separate apartments into a spacious single family home for them had raised ire in the British press. They will continue to use Frogmore Cottage as their base in England.
The deal came after days of talks among royals sparked by Meghan and Harry’s announcement last week that they wanted to step down as senior royals and live part-time in Canada.
The couple’s departure is a wrench for the royal family, and Queen Elizabeth II did say earlier this week that she wished the couple had wanted to remain full-time royals, but she had warm words for them in a statement Saturday.
The 93-year-old queen said she was pleased that “together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family.”
“I recognize the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life,” Elizabeth said.
“It is my whole family’s hope that today’s agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life,” she added.
Despite the queen’s kind words, the new arrangement will represent an almost complete break from life as working royals, especially for Harry. As a devoted Army veteran and servant to the crown, the prince carried out dozens of royal engagements each year,
Royal expert and author Penny Junor said the new setup will benefit both sides of the family.
“There are no blurred lines. They are starting afresh and they are going with the queen’s blessing, I think it is the best of all worlds,” she said.
It is not yet clear whether Harry and Meghan will continue to receive financial support from Harry’s father, Prince Charles, who used revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall to help fund his activities and those of his wife and sons.
The duchy, chartered in 1337, produced more than 20 million pounds ($26 million) in revenue last year. It is widely regarded as private money, not public funds, so Charles may opt to keep details of its disbursal private. Much of the royals’ wealth comes from private holdings.
Though Harry and Meghan will no longer represent the queen, the palace said they would “continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty” while carrying out their private charitable work.
The withdrawal of Harry from royal engagements will increase the demands on his brother, Prince William, and William’s wife, Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge.
Buckingham Palace did not disclose who will pay for the couple’s security going forward. It currently is taxpayer-funded and carried out primarily by a special unit of the Metropolitan Police, also known as Scotland Yard.
“There are well established independent processes to determine the need for publicly funded security,” it said.
Harry and Meghan have grown increasingly uncomfortable with constant media scrutiny since the birth in May of their son, Archie. They married in 2018 in a ceremony that drew a worldwide TV audience.
Meghan joined the royal family after a successful acting career and spoke enthusiastically about the chance to travel throughout Britain and learn about her new home, but disillusionment set in fairly quickly.
She launched legal action against a newspaper in October for publishing a letter she wrote to her father. Harry has complained bitterly of racist undertones in some media coverage of his wife, who is biracial.
There has also been a breach in the longtime close relationship between Harry and William, a future king, over issues that have not been made public.
The couple’s desire to separate from the rest of the family had been the subject of media speculation for months. But they angered senior royals by revealing their plans on Instagram and a new website without advance clearance from the queen or palace officials.
Elizabeth summoned Harry, William and Charles, to an unusual crisis meeting at her rural retreat in eastern England in an effort to find common ground.
The result was Saturday’s agreement, which is different from Harry and Meghan’s initial proposal that they planned to combine a new, financially independent life with a reduced set of royal duties.
It is not known where in Canada the couple plan to locate. They are thought to be considering Vancouver Island, where they spent a long Christmas break, or Toronto, where Meghan filmed the TV series “Suits” for many years.

419,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/floods-road-closures-in-australia-as-storms-lash-some-bushfire-hit-regions-2/,"MELBOURNE: Parts of Australia‘s east coast were hit by severe storms on Saturday, dousing some of the bushfires that have devastated the region for months but causing road closures and flash flooding.
Fears of smoke from the fires disrupting the Australian Open tennis receded in Melbourne, where the main tournament was due to start on Monday.
Despite the heavy rain, authorities were still battling nearly 100 blazes – part of the bushfires that have killed 29 people since September, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and scorched an area nearly one-third the size of Germany.
Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, three of the states most hit by drought and bushfires, are now dealing with rain bucketing down in several areas.
Major highways were closed in Queensland on Saturday, with the state getting some of the heaviest rain Australia has seen for months, while power was cut in parts of New South Wales after a stormy night.
“Heavy, intense rainfall has eased, but showers and thunderstorms still possible through the weekend,” the Bureau of Meteorology in Queensland said on Twitter on Saturday.
“Take care on the roads – if it’s flooded, forget it.”
Parts of Queensland’s south saw triple the monthly rainfall overnight. No major damage has been reported, although some residential areas were flooded and many of the state’s parks and tourist attractions were closed.
New South Wales fire services welcomed the rain, which they said on Twitter would help to control the 75 fires burning in the state, of which 25 are yet to be contained. But, they also said that some firegrounds have not seen any rain yet.
More benign storms were forecast for Victoria over the weekend, which has been hit this week already by severe storms and unhealthy smoke from the bushfires.
Skies were clear in Melbourne, however, for the final round of qualifying for the Australian Open, the year’s first Grand Slam, and Victoria’s Environmental Protection rated the air quality as “good”, after an earlier forecast of unhealthy air for the weekend.
There were still more than a dozen fires burning in Victoria on Saturday, with firefighters battling to contain a big blaze in the state’s mountain region, fifteen times the size of Manhattan.
Victoria’s emergency service also issued an evacuation warning due to a bushfire on Saturday for French Island, the state’s largest coastal island with a small population of just above 100 people.

420,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/car-bomb-hits-turkish-contractors-police-near-somalia-capital-six-wounded-police/,"MOGADISHU: A car bomb targeting a group of Turkish contractors exploded on Saturday in Afgoye, northwest of the Somali capital Mogadishu, wounding at least six people, police said.
It was not known who carried out the attack but residents and police said al Shabaab fighters had tried to attack Afgoye, about 30 km from Mogadishu, late on Friday and were repulsed.
“A speeding suicide car bomb rammed into a place where the Turkish engineers and Somali police were having lunch,” police officer Nur Ali told Reuters from Afgoye.
“So far we know three Turkish engineers and their translator were injured. Two other police men were injured in the blast,” Ali said later when asked about casualties.
Turkey’s state-owned Anadolu news agency said four Turks, employees of a construction firm, who were wounded in the attack and were being treated in hospital, citing information from the Turkish embassy in Mogadishu.
The al Qaeda-linked militant group has claimed responsibility for past attacks in its campaign to overturn Somalia‘s U.N.-backed government.
“We heard a huge blast and soon clouds of smoke into the air. Before the blast, several Turkish engineers and well armed convoy of Somali police were at the scene,” Farah Abdullahi, a shopkeeper, told Reuters from Afgoye.
“We see casualties being carried but we cannot make if they are dead or injured.”
Since a 2011 famine in Somalia, Turkey has been a major source of aid to the country as Ankara seeks to increase its influence in the Horn of Africa in contest with Gulf rivals like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Turkish engineers are helping with road construction in Somalia. A group of engineers was among those hit in late December in a blast at a checkpoint in Mogadishu that killed at least 90 people.

421,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/uk-plans-brexit-celebrations-but-warns-businesses-may-suffer/,"LONDON: The British government has announced plans for special events on the night of January 31 when the country officially leaves the European Union but the country’s treasury chief has admitted that some UK business sectors will suffer as a result.
Sajid Javid told the Financial Times in an interview Saturday that Britain’s regulations will not be aligned with the EU in the future and that those changes may hurt some businesses. Currently, the EU is Britain’s largest trading partner.
“There will not be alignment, we will not be a rule-taker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union — and we will do this by the end of the year,” he said, referring to a deadline at the end of 2020 for conclusion of what are expected to be contentious trade talks with the then-27 member EU.
Britain will officially leave the EU bloc on the night of January 31, even though it will keep following EU rules for an 11-month transition period. It will be the first nation ever to leave the bloc. The British government plans to mark the occasion with a series of upbeat events.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to make a speech to the nation that night after holding a rare cabinet session in the north of England to emphasize his government’s plan to spread the opportunity to that economically beleaguered region.
The government also plans to mark Brexit by projecting a clock onto the prime minister’s official residence at 10 Downing Street in London that will count down until 11 pm, when the break takes place.
The entire government neighborhood of Whitehall is to be illuminated for the occasion as part of a light show, with Union flags flown on all the poles in Parliament Square. The government will also create a commemorative coin that will enter circulation that day.
But Johnson’s Conservative government is no longer actively pushing a plan to have the familiar chimes of the Big Ben clock tower at Parliament sound at 11 pm despite a private fundraising push in support of activating the chimes, which are under repair.
Britain voted in a 2016 referendum to become the first nation to leave the 28-nation EU, but the process has moved more slowly than expected. A stalemate last year kept a withdrawal bill from passing, leading to a rare December election that gave Johnson’s pro-Brexit Conservative Party a strong majority in Parliament.
The Brexit divorce bill quickly passed when the new Parliament convened. A transition period will last until the end of 2020 as negotiators try to forge a trade arrangement between Britain and the remaining EU nations.
Johnson, who is also seeking a trade deal with the United States, has ruled out seeking an extension of the deadline for the EU talks.

422,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/how-trumps-impeachment-differs-from-a-criminal-trial/,"WASHINGTON: Yes, it’s a trial — but the Senate’s impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump won’t resemble anything Americans have seen on Court TV.
In Trump’s trial, the Senate will serve as both judge and jury. The Republicans who control the chamber can forge their own rules if they have enough votes. And the presiding judge is the top one in America, yet can be decisively overruled.

Photo: AP
A look at some of the key differences between a courtroom trial and the impeachment trial that will play out in the coming days:
THE JUDGE
COURTROOM TRIAL: Federal trials, both civil and criminal, are presided over by District Court judges who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. They rule on questions of evidence, motions to dismiss a case or to exclude certain testimony, and all other disputes that emerge both before and during the trial.
SENATE TRIAL: None other than John Roberts, the chief justice of the United States, will preside over this case. He made the short trip Thursday from the Supreme Court to the Capitol to be sworn in. Exactly what role he’ll play is unclear, though it may be a modest one in keeping with his insistence that judges aren’t meant to be politicians. And even if Roberts were to make a ruling from the chair, 51 senators can vote to overrule him.
____
THE JURY
COURTROOM TRIAL: It’s a bedrock principle of American jurisprudence, and enshrined in the Constitution, that defendants have the right to have their fate decided by a jury of their peers — ordinary citizens who, by design, are meant to lack personal connections to the parties, or other biases or motives that could sway their judgment. They’re questioned in advance on their ability to evaluate the evidence fairly and impartially.
SENATE TRIAL: The jury pool here is already preordained under the Constitution and neither side gets any say in who gets to hear the case. The 100 senators who make up the chamber will decide the case, invariably bringing their own partisan leanings toward one side or the other. They’re not required to check any political prejudices or biases at the door — nor will they. They’re also not impassive observers, carrying the power on a majority vote to approve rules or even dismiss the charges.
____
THE WITNESSES
COURTROOM TRIAL: The attorneys for both sides get to call the witnesses they think will bolster their side of the case. The lawyers themselves handle the direct questioning and cross-examination, though judges may also ask clarifying questions. Jurors are not invited to interrupt the proceedings with their own questions, nor do they get to decide whether witnesses are called.
SENATE TRIAL: The senators themselves, in their roles as jurors, will have the opportunity to submit questions in writing. Under the rules, senators can even be called as witnesses in the trial. And it’s not even automatic that there will be witnesses: It requires 51 votes for witnesses to be called.
____
THE PROSECUTORS
COURTROOM TRIAL: Federal criminal cases are tried by prosecutors who work for the Justice Department, their names generally unfamiliar to the American public. In state and local proceedings, those prosecutors are often known as assistant district attorneys. They don’t align themselves with particular political parties or affiliations.
SENATE TRIAL: The prosecutors here aren’t prosecutors in the traditional sense. They’re actually seven Democratic members of Congress, all selected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and given the title of “manager.” Some of the seven are familiar faces from their time leading congressional investigations into Trump, including Rep. Adam Schiff of California and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York.
____
THE VERDICT
COURTROOM TRIAL: To declare a defendant guilty in a criminal case, either on the state or federal level, a jury must be unanimous in its decision — no exceptions. If a jury can’t reach a verdict after a prolonged period of deliberations, then a judge can declare it as deadlocked and dismiss it from duty.
SENATE TRIAL: No such unanimity is required here. It would take a two-thirds majority of senators, 67 if all 100 are voting, to convict the president. Since Republicans make up the majority of the Senate, a conviction is seen as unlikely. If Trump were convicted on either of the two articles against him, he would automatically be removed from office.

423,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/china-population-now-over-1-4-billion-as-birthrate-falls/,"BEIJING: China’s population crept past 1.4 billion last year for the first time, even as the birthrate continues to fall.
The National Bureau of Statistics said Friday the population on the Chinese mainland reached 1.40005 billion at the end of 2019, with another overall gain of 4.67 million people.
That marked the third consecutive year when overall number of births dropped.
China’s working age population, those between 16 and 59 years old, also declined by 890,000 from 2018 to 896.4 million, while the number of people aged 60 or older grew by 4.39 million, making up 18.1% of the total population.
China abandoned its long-standing one-child policy in 2016 in hopes of reversing what some have called a coming demographic tsunami in which China will grow old before reaching its development targets. But the policy allowing urban couples to have a second child has shown little success amid a dearth of incentives and rising costs for housing, food, health care and education.

424,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/days-of-god-a-look-at-irans-mounting-crises/,"
DUBAI: Iran’s supreme leader says his nation is living through “days of God.”
The Islamic Republic has been reeling from one crisis to another, from the targeted killing by the United States of its top general to the Revolutionary Guard’s accidental shootdown of a passenger plane carrying scores of young people, most of them Iranians. U.S. sanctions have crippled its economy as tensions with America have soared.

In a rare Friday sermon in Tehran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stuck to the playbook Iran has relied on since 1979, blaming the country’s woes on the U.S. and other Western powers, and proclaiming that Iranians still support the Islamic Revolution.
He pointed to the outpouring of grief after Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general, was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians attended funeral services across the country for Soleimani, who was revered by many as a war hero. But the funeral itself was marred by tragedy when 56 people died in a stampede of mourners in Soleimani’s hometown of Kerman.
The moment of national unity was shattered days later, when Iranian forces accidentally shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing all 176 people on board, and then concealed their responsibility until they were confronted with mounting evidence from Western leaders.
Here’s a look at the various crises Iran faces:
U.S. SANCTIONS
After unilaterally withdrawing from Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers, President Donald Trump began ratcheting up sanctions. The sanctions have exacerbated an economic crisis, sending the local currency into a freefall and wiping away many people’s life savings.
The Institute of International Finance, a global association of financial institutions, estimates that Iran’s economy will contract this fiscal year by more than 7%, mostly because of the drop in crude oil exports due to sanctions. The report found that as a result, Iran’s reserves are expected to dip to $73 billion by March, totaling nearly $40 billion in losses over two years.
___
THE LOSS OF SOLEIMANI
As head of the Revolutionary Guard’s elite Quds Force, Soleimani was the architect of Iran’s regional military operations and its support for armed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. He was blamed for the killing of hundreds of American soldiers by Iran-backed militias in the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. He also helped Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces battle rebels and Islamic extremists. In Iran, he was seen by many as a mythic figure who had defended the nation. Critics and supporters alike say he will be tough to replace.
___
THE PLANE TRAGEDY
In response to the killing of Soleimani, Iran launched a wave of ballistic missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq. No one was seriously wounded, though several soldiers were screened for concussions and sent to Germany for medical treatment. As Iran braced for a counterattack, the Revolutionary Guard shot down a passenger plane shortly after it took off from Tehran’s international airport last week, mistaking it for a U.S. cruise missile. Most of those killed were Iranians.
Iranian authorities concealed their role for three days, initially blaming a technical failure, until Western leaders said they had mounting evidence that a surface-to-air missile had brought the plane down. Iranian officials have apologized and promised to punish those responsible, but have faced widespread criticism and international demands to pay compensation to victims’ families.

___
STREET PROTESTS
As the economic crisis has worsened, Iran has seen wave after wave of sporadic, leaderless protests. The protests are usually sparked by economic grievances but rapidly escalate into calls to overthrow the Islamic Republic. The demonstrations have often turned violent, and security forces have responded with force. Amnesty International says more than 300 people were killed in protests in November over a hike in gasoline prices, when authorities shut down the internet for several days.
The Revolutionary Guard’s announcement on Saturday that it was responsible for shooting down the plane sparked days of protests in the streets and on university campuses. Security forces dispersed some of the crowds with tear gas and live ammunition.
___
THE UNRAVELING NUCLEAR DEAL
Iran continued to comply with the nuclear deal despite U.S. sanctions until last summer, when it said it would no longer fully abide with the agreement if it received no economic benefits. Iran began openly breaching certain limits set by the deal, and after the killing of Soleimani said it was no longer bound by any of the agreement’s restrictions.
Britain, France and Germany, which also signed the deal along with China and Russia, have been trying to salvage it. They have searched for a mechanism that would allow them to keep trading with Iran but have been unable to find one that would protect their companies from U.S. sanctions.
Earlier this week, the European nations triggered a dispute mechanism in the nuclear deal in an attempt to bring Iran back into compliance. They say they are committed to saving the agreement, but the dispute process could potentially result in the snapback of international sanctions, further compounding Iran’s woes.

425,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/to-defuse-palm-row-davos-diplomacy-likely-between-india-malaysia/,"KUALA LUMPUR/NEW DELHI: Trade ministers from India and Malaysia are likely to meet on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos next week amid a palm oil spat between the two countries, a Malaysian government spokesman told Reuters on Friday.
Hindu-majority India has repeatedly objected to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad speaking out against its recent policies which critics say discriminate against Muslims.

Malaysia, a Muslim-majority nation, is the second biggest producer and exporter of palm oil and India’s restrictions on the refined variety of the commodity imposed last week have been seen as a retaliation for Mahathir’s criticism of New Delhi’s actions.
India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal denied on Thursday that the government was trying to hit out at Malaysia in particular.
The row between the countries, nevertheless, pushed benchmark Malaysian palm futures to its biggest weekly decline in more than 11 years on Friday.
No agenda has been set for the proposed meeting between Goyal and his Malaysian counterpart Darell Leiking on Friday, the spokesman for Malaysia’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry said, adding that the request for a meeting had come from India.
An Indian government source said a meeting was indeed likely with Leiking. A spokeswoman for India’s trade ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Reuters reported on Thursday that Malaysia did not want to escalate the palm spat with India by talking of any retaliation for now, after Mahathir’s media adviser called for tighter regulations on Indian expatriates and products. Malaysia instead wants to rely on diplomacy.
A separate Indian government source said it was important for New Delhi also to talk things out with Malaysia.
“We too have a lot to lose in Malaysia, there are 2 million Indian-origin people there,” the source said.
There were a total of 117,733 Indian nationals registered as foreign labor in Malaysia as at June 2019, accounting for nearly 6% of the total foreign workforce in the country. Ethnic Malaysian-Indians are the third-largest community in the Southeast Asian country.
Another reason for frosty ties between the countries is the continued presence of controversial Indian Islamic preacher Zakir Naik in Malaysia, said one of the sources.
Naik, who faces charges of money laundering and hate speech in India, has lived in Malaysia for more than three years and has permanent residency in the country. He denies the Indian accusations.
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to talk to the media.
