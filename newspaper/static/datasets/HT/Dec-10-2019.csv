FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

2,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

3,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

4,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

The ordinance will now be sent to the President for certification.
The Authority, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister, is being set up prior to the international donors’ conference, scheduled for June 25, which aims at seeking support from the international communities to rebuild Nepal.
When the ordinance is certified, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala will nominate four ministers and three experts as members of the high-level body, according to Minister for General Administration Lalbabu Pandit.
Likewise, Vice-Chairperson of the National Planning Commission and Chief Secretary will be members of the Authority.
The post-earthquake Reconstruction Authority will have a chief executive officer also. It will oversee all reconstruction works in the earthquake-hit districts where physical infrastructures have been damaged.
Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam informed that there will be a separate committee of foreign consultants that would be constantly supporting the Authority in its job.
According to the government’s assessment, the tremors caused damage worth Rs 513.38 billion to physical infrastructure and assets, and inflicted income loss of another Rs 187.08 billion.
The government has set the target to collect more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors for the post-earthquake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
 Objectives of International Conference on Nepal’s Reconstruction


Appraise friendly countries and development partners of the socio-economic situation in Nepal in the aftermath of the massive earthquake and share international best practices and experiences on institutional arrangements that lead to effective, transparent and accountable execution of reconstruction programs.
Disseminate the findings of the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA).

KATHMANDU: The government has set the target to garner more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors’ conference being organised on June 25 for the post-quake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
A study of losses caused by the devastating Gorkha Quake on April 25 and its aftershocks in various regions across the country shows that physical infrastructures worth Rs 512 billion were damaged by the quake and over Rs 666 billion was needed for reconstruction, rehabilitation and new construction.
The government is preparing to collect the assistance by presenting the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) report in the conference prepared by the National Planning Commission for the same.
According to the PDNA report, over Rs 399 billion is necessary for reconstruction and rehabilitation tasks in cultural heritage, education, health and human settlement sectors.
Similarly, Rs 117 billion is needed for reconstruction of agriculture, industry, irrigation and tourism sectors.
Likewise, the PDNA report estimates that it will cost Rs 74.26 billion for reconstruction of media, community infrastructures, hydropower, transport and drinking water and sanitation sectors while Rs 75.11 billion to recover the damaged gender, social security, nutrition, employment, environment and forest areas into previous position.

Federal agents arrested Zhang last year at the San Jose airport as he was about to board a flight for China.
Prosecutors allege Chen took from Apple more than 2,000 files containing “manuals, schematics, diagrams and photographs of computer screens showing pages in Apple’s secure databases” with intent to share them. Agents arrested him in January at a train station on his way to San Francisco International Airport for a trip to China.
The men were each charged with one count of criminal trade secrets theft and pleaded not guilty. They were released on bail shortly after their arrests and have been monitored since then.
Attorney Daniel Olmos, who represents the men, said Monday that both had family reasons to visit China and had shown no signs of violating their pre-trial conditions so far.
Assistant US Attorney Marissa Harris argued that if either man fled to China, it would be difficult if not impossible for federal officials to secure their extradition for a trial. Three Apple employees sat in the courtroom to support prosecutors, including Anthony DeMario, a strategic adviser to Apple‘s global security group and veteran of the US Central Intelligence Agency.
Harris read Apple‘s statement to US District Judge Edward J. Davila in San Jose, California.
“Apple’s intellectual property is at the core of our innovation and growth,” the statement said. “The defendants’ continued participation in these proceedings is necessary to ensure a final determination of the facts, and we have deep concerns the defendants will not see this through if given the opportunity.
Zhan stood listening through an interpreter and was dressed in a white and blue dress shirt, black jeans and Nike sneakers. Olmos told Davila GPS monitoring was unnecessary to secure Zhang’s appearance at trial.
“This is not an espionage case,” Olmos said. The government “is not requesting detention, but they are requesting essentially indefinitely location monitoring.”
Harris said Zhang’s wife told federal agents that Zhang, who is a permanent US resident, attempted to flee to Canada when agents searched his home.
During that search, agents found a laptop at the bottom of a laundry hamper that they allege contained trade secrets about Ethernet technology from Zhang’s prior employer, chip supplier Marvell Technology Group Ltd, according to court documents.
Chen, a US citizen who emmigrated from China in 1991, listened to the proceedings through an interpreter and wore a dark blue hoodie. He has been under radiofrequency monitoring, which is less precise than GPS tracking.

CONFIDENTIAL MISSILE DOCUMENT
Prosecutors allege that Chen is a flight risk in part because they found documents from several other former employers – including General Electric Co and Raytheon Co – at Chen’s second residence in Maryland, where his wife and son live. Prosecutors said in court papers they found a 2011 document from Raytheon that they later determined was classified as “confidential,” the lowest level of sensitivity in the US government system.
“This document contains information relating to Raytheon’s work on the Patriot Missile program and was not (and is not) permitted to be maintained outside of Department of Defense secured locations,” prosecutors wrote.
Olmos, the defense attorney, said it was not a file, but a single paper document “sitting in a box somewhere” in Chen’s home.
Trial dates have not been scheduled. A hearing is scheduled for February.

The Airline Operators Association of Nepal (AOAN) has requested Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai to allow them to operate flights to Lukla directly from Kathmandu until the maintenance works at the Manthali airport are completed.
During a meeting held today at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA), representatives from AOAN sought permission from the ministry to fly to Lukla from Kathmandu as the Manthali airport in Ramechhap district is being upgraded at present.
As per AOAN, tourists have been facing problems due to lack of facilities at Manthali airport. Until the government finishes upgrading the Manthali airport’s capacity, flights to Lukla should be operated from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), AOAN said. Likewise, the association has requested the minister to take the initiative to enhance road connectivity from Kathmandu to Ramechhap for the convenience of road travellers.
As the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has announced about operating regular flights to Lukla from Manthali, the maintenance of the airport is under way at the moment.
Likewise, AOAN has also requested the tourism minister to introduce a policy allowing them to operate flights in restricted areas.

“There are some restricted areas in the country where helicopters are not allowed to fly. So, considering the Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign, we have requested MoCTCA to allow choppers to go to those restricted areas at least during VNY 2020 campaign,” said Captain Rameshwor Thapa, president of AOAN.
Thapa further expressed his positive response towards the recommendations submitted to MoCTCA regarding airfare discounts for elderly passengers and other suggestions regarding airfare issues in the domestic aviation sector. “We will work together with the government and further discussions will be held to sort out the airfare issues,” he added.
Meanwhile, the ministry formed a committee today during the meeting to study the prospect of providing discounts to international VIPs and celebrities for VNY 2020.
The committee comprises representatives from VNY 2020 secretariat, Nepal Tourism Board and AOAN.

11,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/ownership-of-the-campaign-is-mantra-for-success-of-visit-nepal-2020/,"The country is gearing up to kick off the mega tourism campaign — Visit Nepal 2020 — in less than a month. While the government has set an ambitious goal to draw in two million tourists in the year and promote Nepal as a ‘lifetime experience’ destination, stakeholders are concerned about tepid preparations of the campaign and are sceptical about the target. Moreover, the falling contribution of tourism sector in the national economy has remained a major concern of the tourism fraternity. Against this backdrop, Sujan Dhungana and Arpana Ale Magar of The Himalayan Times spoke to tourism entrepreneur Yogendra Sakya, who was also the national coordinator of Visit Nepal 2011, to discuss the issues plaguing the tourism industry and his views on Visit Nepal 2020 campaign. Excerpts:
Everybody is talking about the country’s tourism prospects and challenges ahead of the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign. Where does the industry stand today?
The contribution of tourism in the national gross domestic product value, which at one point was almost 12 per cent, is currently just three per cent. Despite this, Nepal has managed to create much hullabaloo about its tourism, making it seem like the sector is the saviour of the national economy. However, statistics show that tourism sector is not the major driver of the national economy.
So, what happened to an industry that had such a major stake in the economy?
Back in the days when the tourism sector made almost 12 per cent contribution to the national economy, Nepal Airlines used to handle over 60 per cent of air travellers in Nepal. Today the national flag carrier handles less than four per cent of air travellers. Thus, the income that Nepal Airlines used to make from air travellers in the past is today being taken by foreign airlines. One of the major reasons behind dwindling stake of tourism in the national economy is the loss in airfare component.
Do you mean to say the tourism industry today is regressive?
I wouldn’t say it is regressive, but the problem facing the tourism industry in Nepal is lack of innovation. Innovation in the tourism sector is imperative to attract new visitors as well as lure people to keep coming back. We have some adventure products for which tourists come to Nepal. Such products need to be expanded and promoted. There is a big debate between quality and quantity in Nepal’s tourism sector. Nepal is not a controlled tourism destination as we are guided by an open market economy. Thus, there should not be any control in the rates and licences in the tourism sector. For example, there has been an exponential growth of hotels in Nepal in recent years.
But hoteliers are not lobbying against issuance of licences to new hotels. In an open economy, hotels do not fix the rate of their services, but consumers do. So, how should the country earn money from tourists?
It is by coming up with innovative ideas that encourage tourists to visit new places and spend on different tourism products. This is where Nepal is lacking. If we look at available innovative products — whether trekking, rafting, zip-flying, jungle safari or bungee jumping — all were initially started by some foreigners. These innovations were started many years ago. But these days there is dearth of such new innovative ideas and activities in Nepal, where tourists would love to go and spend. Tourism is not just about building big hotels and injecting huge investment.
Innovative ideas and activities are necessary to bring in tourists to the country and make them spend. But our tourism industry has been stuck in the rut, in a way.
I think the young generation has been stagnant. They have been unable to come up with innovative ideas that do not require a large sum of money. Not all creative ideas require a lot of funds. The government has announced its plans to increase the daily expense of foreign tourists to $80 from the current $45. We need concrete plans and a wide range of products to realise such plans.
Against this backdrop, the government has set the ambitious target to draw in two million tourists in 2020 and to increase the number of annual tourists to five million by 2030. How scientific are these goals?

In business, it is okay to have high hopes, but faith alone is not sufficient to achieve the set targets. For instance, the biggest setback for Nepal Airlines earlier was lack of adequate aircraft. Today it has comparatively higher number of aircraft, but it lacks the plans to fully utilise them.
We say the biggest setback in the tourism sector at present is lack of adequate infrastructure.
This issue is slowly being addressed with international airports being constructed in Bhairahawa and Pokhara that are expected to be completed soon. But what if these airports fail to generate air traffic as no one today is talking about how to operate them profitably? What if airline companies do not show any interest to operate from these airports?
Should that happen, our investment in these airports and hospitality industry will simply be wasted, thereby affecting the entire economy. So, just developing infrastructure is not enough. Operation plan of such infrastructure is crucial.
The success of any infrastructure depends on whether we are able to operate them in a full-fledged manner once it is ready.
Less than a month remains before the Visit Nepal 2020 tourism campaign is slated to begin. As you coordinated a similar tourism campaign in 2011, what are the changes that you have found in terms of readiness, plans and prospects of the campaign for next year?
Firstly, it is quite important for us to know why we observe such campaigns.
Generally, a country observes such tourism campaigns to give a strong message.
Nepal observed a number of such campaigns, but people remember only two — observed in 1998 and 2011. There were two reasons behind observing Visit Nepal 1998. Internally, agencies including Nepal Rastra Bank had been floating message that investing in tourism industry had no returns and the sector had no contribution to the national economy. Similarly, the Times magazine published an article on Nepal’s Shangri-La titled ‘Goodbye Shangri-La.’ The very brand of Shangri-La that we were banking on had been shaken in the international arena. As a result, the country’s tourism sector panicked. Hence, the Visit Nepal 1998 was observed to counter the aforementioned negative image of the country’s tourism both within the country and abroad. In 2011, the inflow of tourists in Nepal was coming down drastically due to long insurgency and political instability. So, the Visit Nepal 2011 was organised to bring everyone together for tourism. There is much talk about Visit Nepal 2020, which is very good.
Now efforts should be made to assure that everybody takes ownership of this campaign.
From people to the government, they should play the necessary role to make this campaign successful. Hoteliers should ensure quality service to tourists, while the government should ensure necessary infrastructure. Success of Visit Nepal 2020 tourism campaign depends on how everybody is mobilised for this campaign. Ownership of the campaign is the mantra for success of Visit Nepal 2020.
Compared to 1998 and 2011, this is the best time to promote tourism, as the country is stable and the capacity of Nepal Airlines has been enhanced. But confusion today lies in the slogan of the campaign for next year — Lifetime Experience.
Undeniably, the slogan is good, but it lacks clarity on what it means. Campaigners are lacking clarity on the slogan. Any campaign should give one message at one time. Regarding the Visit Nepal 2020, people are quite confused about the message that the campaign wants to give. Similarly, tourism policies are crucial to promote tourism. While we say ‘atithi devo bhawa’ (tourists are gods), our policies discriminate against them and we only treat them as money generating machines. I feel such policies should be changed so that foreigners are encouraged to visit Nepal.

The government is preparing to reduce the subsidy it provides to farmers under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation Project (PMAMP). As per the direction of the Ministry of Finance, the government is preparing to reduce farmer’s subsidy on PMAMP.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MoALD) is in the process of revising the framework of PMAMP, for which it has formed a committee to conduct necessary studies of the PMAMP framework.
“Among other provisions we are also thinking of reducing PMAMP subsidy for farmers involved in fruits, vegetables, flowers and livestock farming,” said Hari Bahadur KC, spokesperson for MoALD. As per him, the current framework of PMAMP has a provision to provide up to 80 per cent subsidy to farmers for their agriculture businesses. However, the Finance Ministry this year has asked MoALD to reduce farmer subsidy to 50 per cent from 80 per cent.
“Based on the direction of the Finance Ministry we have formed a committee to study the market on whether the reduction of subsidy from PMAMP is possible or not,” KC said.
“Soon after the study committee submits its report we will prepare a new draft of PMAMP framework that will be tabled at the Cabinet for approval.”
Hence, there is a possibility of reduction of subsidy on revised framework of PMAMP.
The PMAMP, a 10-year project of MoALD, was introduced in fiscal 2016- 17 aiming to transform the country’s agricultural sector from subsistence farming to commercial farming.
“Coming to the fourth year of the project, the necessity for a few changes in the project framework has been realised. To make the PMAMP modality more contextual, we are revising its framework,” KC added.
He further said that most of the PMAMP works depend on the central government. As the country’s structure has transformed into federal system, MoALD is also preparing to distribute work responsibility of PMAMP, he added. “The programmes under PMAMP are not being carried out as per our expectations. So, we are revising the framework of this project.”

Though the government has been harping on planning to ease the growing traffic congestion along the major highways across the country, it still has not been able to prepare the detailed project report (DPR) of the 110-km-long Narayangarh-Butwal section of the East-West Highway, which is considered to be one of the busiest road sections of the country.

The Department of Roads (DoR) had earlier drafted the DPR of the project in August last year, but locals and other concerned stakeholders had objected to it citing that it was incomplete. After that the DoR had started to draft a new DPR for the project.
As per the agreement with Asian Development Bank (ADB), the government will be able to avail $180 million soft loan for Narayangarh-Butwal section and $20 million for improvement of 41-km-long Bhairahawa-Lumbini section. The project is being funded by the ADB.
Tilak Mahat, a parliamentarian representing Nawalparasi-2, said that the government needs to change the earlier incomplete DPR of the project. “There is no problem of funds but the project has been stalled for over one year as the DPR has still not been drafted.”
Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport, Basanta Kumar Nembang, said the government is committed to take forward the project after the DPR is completed.
“The 1,028-km-long East-West Highway is the lifeline of the country, so the pace of construction activities along this highway needs to be accelerated and the government is committed to completing the project within the stipulated timeframe,” he added.
The minister informed that the Narayangarh-Butwal road expansion project was in the government’s priority list. “There are some issues related to felling trees and we will resolve it as soon as possible by coordinating with the related ministry.”
Nembang further claimed that works related to the expansion of the East-West Highway would be completed during the tenure of the present government.
As per DoR’s plan, the Narayangarh-Butwal road section will be developed into a four-lane fast track project. The ‘Policies and Programmes’ for current fiscal 2019-20, which was presented earlier this year, has also mentioned that the East-West Highway would be widened into four lanes.

Nepali Army (NA), which has been assigned the full responsibility for construction of 72.5-kilometre-long Kathmandu-Tarai Fast Track, has expressed its commitment to complete the project by May 13, 2024.
Organising a press meet here today, NA said it would complete the project on time and put an end to all the criticism it has been facing.
“We are almost ready to execute the project which is in the top priority of the government and the project will be completed within the stipulated timeframe,” said Brigadier General Bigyan Dev Pandey, spokesperson for Nepali Army.

The construction of the Fast Track project was expected to gain momentum after the Cabinet approved its detailed project report (DPR) on August 21. The DPR of the project had been submitted by a South Korean firm called Soosung Engineering and Consulting Company to the Nepali Army on February 4. The DPR was later forwarded to the Cabinet for approval by the Ministry of Defence on March 16.
Pandey further informed that NA has developed a new strategy for timely implementation of the project and will formally start its construction in the beginning of 2020. “Under the direction of Chief of Army Staff General Purna Chandra Thapa, we will prepare our new strategy by December-end and immediately implement project execution from January,” he reiterated.
As per the new DPR, the project will be constructed based on ‘Asian Highway Class I’ standards. This means that the highway will have four or more lanes and the construction material used for the pavement will be asphalt or cement concrete.
Based on the DPR, the construction cost of the project has been estimated at Rs 175.19 billion, which is Rs 63.19 billion more than the earlier estimate of Rs 112 billion. “The consultant company has determined the estimated cost of the project based on the government set rate and international standards.” However, NA has yet to give a clear answer for the reasons behind the rise in construction cost.
Of the total 72.5-km-long project, 55.2 km stretch will be roads, 6.41 km tunnels and the remaining 10.59 km will be bridges.
As per Pandey, NA will construct three tunnels — one 3.35-km-long tunnel in Mahadev Danda of Lalitpur district, another 1.63-km-long in Dhandre Danda and the third 1.43-km-long tunnel in Len Danda of Makawanpur district. There will be 71 small and big bridges along the Fast Track as mentioned in the DPR.

Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport, Basanta Kumar Nemwang, said today that the government will take stern action against contractors intentionally delaying projects.
Nemwang said that the government will first identify projects that are being delayed, investigate reasons behind the delay and penalise contractors if they are delaying the project without any valid reasons. “Once contractors take the responsibility for a project, they should complete it. If contractors are found delaying the project intentionally, the government will scrap the contract with such contractors and hire a new one.”
Minister Nemwang had recently monitored different ongoing road and bridge projects across Rupandehi district. Following his inspection, he said that anyone not fulfilling their responsibility, stalling the project and promoting unnecessary issues will have to bear the brunt.

Among others, Minister Nemwang expressed deep concern on the delayed Bhairahawa-Lumbini road project. “We are observing Visit Nepal Year 2020 tourism campaign. However, the progress of the Bhairahawa-Lumbini road, the major route linking Lumbini, which is a tourist destination, is not satisfactory,” he said.
Moreover, Minister Nemwang directed the project developer and the contractor of Bhairahawa-Lumbini road project to complete it within December. “Roads connecting Lumbini should be made better before the tourism year begins.”
Meanwhile, he also informed that the detailed project report of the planned tunnel in Siddhababa region in Butwal has been prepared. “We will publish a tender notice for this project within one month,” the minister added.

The 45-megawatt Upper Bhotekoshi Hydropower Project has finally started its test transmission from today. Though it had been commissioning energy since January 2001, the project had been closed after the April 25, 2015 earthquake and floods and landslides had completely damaged the project.
Initially, the project had been partially damaged by the earthquake and later in July, 2016, the floods in the Bhotekoshi River completely damaged the project. The project was being reconstructed since the last two years. The reconstruction work of the Upper Bhotekoshi hydropower project was completed by Sino Hydro’s Bureau 11, a Chinese company, at a cost of about Rs seven billion.
A majority of the works including civil, hydroelectrical and hydromechanical works was done by Sino Hydro while works related to installation of turbine and generator were handled by an American company named Francis Turbine.
Bikram Sthapit, chief executive officer of the company, said they have plans to continue with the test generation for 15 days and from December 22, we will start the commercial generation from the project.
According to him, the internal testing of the project has been completed successfully.

“Now, we have started test transmission of the project,” Sthapit said, adding that they had successfully conducted this work with support from Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA).
There is a provision in Power Development Agreement that NEA needs to first test any project before it starts commercial production.
“Due to the low flow of water in the winter season, we will be able to generate only 22 to 25 megawatts of electricity. After the water level rises we will able to operate in a full-fledged manner,” Sthapit said.
Upper Bhotekoshi project is located at Bhotekoshi Rural Municipality in Sindhupalchowk district and was developed by the private sector.
“NEA will test the project within a week. The commercial power production will start within the next 15 days,” he added. After the reconstruction was completed, the project tested the physical infrastructure and equipment of the hydropower plant.

Kathmandu, December 8
As the number of complaints made by people on various irregularities has started rising, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) — the country’s anti-graft body — has urged all local bodies to follow the Public Procurement Act.
Releasing an investigation report on December 1, the CIAA had said that local bodies have been involved in numerous irregularities in collusion with local consumer committees and their officials. “They have not bothered to follow the basic criteria that the law states and have been disbursing funds to contractors and other stakeholders in a haphazard manner,” the report states.
As per CIAA, consumer committees are being provided payments by local authorities in advance even before any work
has started. It also mentioned that the local bodies have been finalising reports of projects even before the concerned projects have been completed.

Pradip Kumar Koirala, spokesperson for CIAA, said they have already directed all the local bodies to follow the proper laws, including the Local Government Operation Act and Public Procurement Act and its directives and guidelines, among others.
“We found that local bodies and their stakeholders are involved in various development works on mutual understanding and in a non-transparent manner. So, we have directed them to act as per law and urged them to immediately terminate the contracts of projects where there are irregularities and start a new bidding process as soon as possible,” said Koirala. “We have also asked them to take action against the erring consumer committees.”
As per Koirala, they have received the highest number of complaints about irregularities at the offices related to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration, which oversees the affairs of the local governments.
The report also stated that the local bodies are using heavy equipment for minor works which could have been completed by utilising local human resources. Furthermore, the
Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority has stated that the equipment are not being leased in a competitive manner.
“The local bodies are working in a very irresponsible manner and if we do not put an end to this trend immediately it will give rise to further anomalies in development works,” Koirala stated.
After the local elections were held after a gap of 20 years in 2017, it was largely expected that elected representatives would be accountable to the people and governance would improve.
But, the CIAA investigation report has shown that they are still immature to handle their development works and are not following good governance practices.
As per the report, the local bodies have not bothered to listen to the needs of the people and are not utilising local human and natural resources.
They have also not done anything substantial that would help promote entrepreneurship at the local level, among other issues, the report states.

The full text of SC had quashed the CGT liability determined by the LTO on Ncell which was worth Rs 62.63 billion citing that imposing an additional 50 per cent fine on applicable CGT liability on Ncell was not as per the law.
Since Ncell had paid Rs 23.57 billion as CGT to the government on June 4, 2017, LTO had determined Rs 39.06 billion as remaining CGT liability of Ncell. However, Ncell had moved the Supreme Court seeking a stay on LTO’s decision, arguing that the office had violated the due process while reassessing Ncell’s CGT liability. Primarily, Ncell had objected to LTO’s decision to impose 50 per cent fine on the applicable tax amount.
Subsequently, the apex court had ruled in Ncell’s favour on August 25, observing that it could be expected to fulfil its CGT liability from February 6, when the SC gave its ruling, and not the date the LTO had mentioned for imposing CGT on Ncell.

A study committee has recommended the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) to implement uniformity in airfare. The report prepared by the committee that was coordinated by former tourism secretary Suresh Man Shrestha has mentioned that the government has to implement a policy to set airfare based on market demand and supply rather than nationalities.
“In the international market airline companies are free to set airfares based on market demand. So, the same policy should be implemented in the domestic market too,” the report says. The report further mentions airline companies should reduce commission being provided to tour and trekking agencies for selling air tickets to foreigners.
As per the report, tour and trekking agencies are at present getting around 50 per cent to 60 per cent commission from airline companies while selling tickets to foreigners. Hence, the government needs to implement a policy whereby such commissions do not exceed 20 per cent per ticket, added the report.
The report further mentions that introducing a policy of setting airfares based on market demand will take time for it to be prepared and implemented. Hence, till the policy is prepared and implemented the average airfare and minimum airfare for foreign tourists in domestic flights can be set in the first phase as a short-term solution. In the second phase the government has to deregulate different airfares on trunk routes and non-tourist sectors and bring a single airfare policy into implementation.
The report further adds that providing 50 per cent discount to passengers above 70 years is possible if the government is ready to subsidise such airfares. “Based on the national census 2011, the population of people above 70 years occupies only 3.19 per cent of the total population of the country. And the number of elderly passengers flying is very low in the country, so, it won’t be a problem to provide discounts to elderly people,” reads the report.
The report has recommended the government to establish a fund to subsidise airfares for elderly people through which the airline companies can receive the amount that was discounted for elderly passengers.
Likewise, the report has also mentioned that airfares have become expensive in the country due to the high price of aviation turbine fuel. As per the report, Nepal Oil Corporation is earning more profit from aviation turbine fuel. If the profit margin on such fuel can be reduced the airfare will ultimately go down, added the report.
MoCTCA had formed the study committee in September to look into the possibility of providing airfare discounts to elderly people, to implement uniformity in domestic airfare, and the possibilities of reducing the rate of aviation turbine fuel.

As the government has not bothered to provide knowledge to concerned officials on how to use the related software and printing machines, almost 800,000 service seekers have been deprived of smart driving licences.
An interesting aspect, however, is that the Department of Transport Management (DoTM) has installed a mass printer to print smart driving licence cards and high-level officials had visited Italy to learn about its functions, however, the machine has not been brought to use yet. “The issue here is that instead of technical personnel some highlevel officials who are not involved in the printing process had gone for the training,” said an official at DoTM seeking anonymity.
As a result, the DoTM is still using the older printers that have limited capacity to print the smart cards. Consequently, DoTM has not been able to issue smart driving licences to almost 800,000 service seekers who had applied for renewal of old licences or had passed vehicle trial 15 months ago.
Even DoTM officials accept the fact that it has not been able to issue smart driving licences as per demand owing to low printing capacity.
Tirtha Raj Khanal, director at the department, said they have been facing problems in issuing licence to the people since the smart driving licence was introduced four years back and the problem has compounded since the last two years. “We are trying our best but have not been able to resolve the issue.”

Earlier, Gogan Bahadur Hamal, who had been appointed as director general of the department on May 2, had claimed that he would eliminate the problem entirely by December but his claims have not yet materialised and the problem still persists.
“It is true that we have not been able to cater to the demand for smart driving licence and a large number of service seekers have been affected. However, we are doing our best to print as many smart licences as we can,” said Khanal. “Once we start utilising the mass printer, which we hope will be by next week, we will be able to resolve this predicament.”
The new mass printer has the capacity to print 400 smart cards per hour, as per DoTM. “After the mass printer is put into operation we plan to print cards for 18 hours a day in three shifts,” Khanal stated.
To make matters worse, nearly 14,000 smart licences that the department had issued earlier have to be reprinted as the information of the cardholders printed on the cards is unclear and the chips embedded in them have also dislodged. As per DoTM, information related to blood group and address were not clearly printed and the photo of the cardholder was also not clearly visible.

Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai has said there is no need to worry over the Supreme Court (SC)’s direction to halt all the ongoing construction works at the site of Nijgadh International Airport (NIA).
Addressing the International Civil Aviation Organisation Day today, he said that the apex court just wanted to be certain that the rising environmental concerns related to NIA construction are addressed properly by the concerned authorities.
“NIA construction is related with the future of the country’s economic development, so the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) will brief the SC regarding the need to build NIA,” the minister said, adding SC’s direction is a very genuine direction that has to be followed. He, however, said that it will not affect the construction of NIA.
Bhattarai further said that the SC has sought further clarification from concerned authorities as there were rumours that more than 2.5 million trees would be felled, which would destroy the habitat of scores of wild animals.
“The apex court has called for a discussion and if I do get the permission then I am ready to visit the SC for the hearing,” he said.
“No government body will go against the country’s development process. So, it is our responsibility to make the SC understand why NIA is needed for the country’s development.”
Minister Bhattarai further highlighted that there is no alternative other than to construct the Nijgadh airport.
Although the field work of NIA has been halted, paper works and planning will continue, he added. “It is very important for us to get rid of the rumours about NIA construction,” he said, directing all stakeholders to spread the message to the masses on why NIA is important for the country’s development.
According to him, the government is working on NIA construction considering both the development and environment aspects simultaneously.

Meanwhile, speaking at the event, Rajan Pokhrel, director of Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), has assured that issues regarding NIA will be resolved soon. “There has been a bit of confusion created among stakeholders at the moment regarding NIA construction,” he said, “However, I assure that all the issues of Nijgadh airport will be sorted out through discussions and construction will begin soon.”
On Friday, the SC had directed the government to halt all the ongoing construction works of NIA while CAAN and MoCTCA are preparing for the commencement of construction activities within this month.
In September, the government had shortlisted Zürich Airport International AG to construct the NIA.

VNY 2020 to be base year with plans to attract 3.5m tourists per year

Kathmandu, December 6
Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai has said that the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) is preparing to observe ‘Tourism Decade’ campaign soon after the Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign.

Following the completion of the merger process, Global IME Bank and Janata Bank have begun integrated transactions from today becoming the country’s largest commercial bank.
Global IME Bank and Janata Bank have completed the merger process and the merged entity has started integrated transaction under the name of Global IME Bank. The merger between these two banks also means that the number of commercial banks in the country has come down to 27 at present.

In the last week of September, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) had approved the merger plan of these two big commercial banks and had given them three months to complete the process and launch operations as one unit.
Following this merger, the paid-up capital of Global IME Bank has reached Rs 24 billion making it the largest commercial bank of the country. Similarly, Global IME Bank now has more than 300 branches, 295 ATMs and 33 extension counters across the country.
While industrialist Chandra Dhakal is chairman of Global IME Bank, Parshuram Kunwar is its chief executive officer.
Praising the merger of these two banks, Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada said that banks should give priority to public benefits and interests. “Along with becoming the country’s largest bank, Global IME Bank should now keep public interest at its centre and work for the betterment of the entire banking sector,” the finance minister said.
Citing that a bank becoming bigger in size also means enhanced capacity to invest, he urged Global IME to raise its investment in mega projects across different sectors.
Meanwhile, Khatiwada also expressed his dissatisfaction over banks highly prioritising their promoters and the facilities being provided to the chief executive officers of banks. “Banks have been earning quite good and the salaries of CEOs have been increasing overwhelmingly in recent years. However, banks have not been giving due priority to public interest and digital
security issues,” he added.
Meanwhile, NRB Governor Chiranjibi Nepal said that the merger between Global IME Bank and Janata Bank will encourage other commercial banks to opt for mergers. Nepal also said that merged banks, after getting larger in size, should also look at raising capacity of its management team and make ample investment in security issues.
“Different cases have shown that banks need to work on capacity building of its staffs. Amid rising banking threats, banks should invest enough in its human resources and security,” said Nepal.
As per the governor, banks have been primarily focusing on profits which is promoting unhealthy competition among banks. He also asked the board of directors of banks not to put undue pressure on the chief executive officers to increase profits.

Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) and Nepal Telecom (NT) today signed an agreement to lay 2,500-kilometre-long optical fibre in the Karnali Province and Sudurpaschim Province along the East-West Highway, Mid-Hill Highway and Postal Highway.
Purushottam Khanal, chairman of NTA, and Dilli Ram Adhikari, managing director of NT, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to lay the optical fibre cables within two years. After detailed study of the project, the NTA and NT will sign construction agreement within a month.
Following the construction pact, NT will be responsible for laying optical fibre cables in both the provinces in areas stretching from Musikot of Rukum to Jhulaghat of Baitadi district. NT will lay minimum 96 core optical fibre cables along the aforementioned three highways and 48 core optical fibre cables along routes connecting the highway with the headquarters of 20 districts. Similarly, it will lay 24 core optical fibre cables in routes connecting the highway with different municipalities in these districts.
“As per the government’s plans to make a communication super highway, we have accelerated the fibre laying works,” Khanal said, also expressing hope that the entire project will be completed within the set deadline.

Khanal further said laying the optical fibre along various highways and connecting areas is part of the government’s long-term target to expand broadband network across all district headquarters, municipalities, schools and health centres.
He said that the agreement for laying optical fibre cables will play a crucial role in achieving the goals set through the Broadband Policy 2015 and the National Information and Communication Policy.
NT Managing Director Adhikari expressed his commitment to complete the project on schedule. According to him, the company will soon call a global tender and award the contract to lay the optical fibre in the two provinces.
In June 2016, NTA had signed another agreement with NT to lay optical fibre cables along the East-West Highway and the project is nearing completion.
Citing snail-paced work and lack of significant progress in laying fibre cables in Karnali and Sudurpaschim, NTA had scrapped its earlier agreement with Smart Telecom on October 28. Smart had been awarded the contract in September 2017, with the completion deadline of two years.

Stakeholders have stressed on the need for the government to formulate integrated laws governing the business sector to promote investment in the country.
Outlining that contradictions in multiple business-related laws and policies have been discouraging potential growth of business sector, they emphasised that a unified policy could provide a much needed boost to businesses and investment growth in Nepal.
“Even today, Nepal has some unnecessary laws and policies that are affecting businesses and investment. It is high time for the government to scrap such obsolete and unnecessary policies and introduce an integrated policy to regulate the business sector,” said former finance secretary Rameshwor Khanal while addressing a discussion programme.
Multiple business- and investment-related policies formulated by different ministries are contradictory and ambiguous, thereby discouraging business persons, as per him. “For instance, tax waiver and subsidy on any good and service can be given only through the Financial Act. However, other policies have been giving tax subsidy to businesses and investors under different headings,” informed Khanal.
He also said that the registration and exit process for companies in Nepal are yet to be simplified as procedural hurdles are the primary factors that businessmen and investors look at before injecting investment in any country.
Khanal also opined that there should not be any minimum threshold and capital requirement for investors to invest in Nepal.
Meanwhile, Madhav Poudel, president of Nepal Law Commission, said that the government is facing difficulty in addressing various practical hurdles in existing policies and laws.
“The government is aware of all policy hurdles and contradictions in the existing laws that are discouraging businesses. While it is working to gradually address such issues, the government agencies are facing structural problems and difficulties related to coordination,” said Poudel.
Acknowledging the importance of bringing integrated policy to regulate businesses and investment, Poudel said that the concept has to be brought to light and discussed widely among stakeholders.
Uday Raj Sapkota, joint secretary at the Ministry of Finance (MoF), on the other hand, claimed that the government is serious about addressing the issues of policy ambiguity and contradictions. He said that the private sector should, nevertheless, clearly communicate about the problems they are facing due to existing policies and come up with feasible recommendations.
Similarly, Niranjan Shrestha, director of Laxmi Group, said that contradictory policies have been deteriorating business and investment environment in the country.

The Nepal Bankers’ Association (NBA) today felicitated renowned banker Prithvi Bahadur Pandé for his remarkable contribution to the country’s banking sector over the last four decades and the role he has played in strengthening Nepal’s financial sector.
Amid the 23rd annual general meeting of NBA held here today, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) Governor Chiranjibi Nepal felicitated Pandé, the chairperson of Nepal Investment Bank Ltd (NIBL), as one of the pioneers in banking industry and praised his contribution in boosting the standards of country’s financial institutions.
Pandé, who is also the former president of NBA, started his banking career as a chartered accountant at NRB in October 1978.
“The experience I garnered during my time at NRB laid the foundation, opened up opportunities, boosted my self-confidence and expanded my network, which in turn prepped me for my career shift as a commercial banker,” said Pandé after being felicitated.
Following a decade-long service at the central bank, Pandé went on to initiate the first Nepali-led joint venture Bank — Himalayan Bank Ltd — in 1988. After managing Himalayan Bank for 10 years, Pandé became engaged with Nepal Indo Suez Bank, the current NIBL. It has now been seven years since he stepped away from his role as an executive chairman of NIBL.
Pandé emphasised that the large number of banks in the country is the prime challenge facing the banking sector today. “NRB has realised this and has started the process of consolidation. NRB is on the right path as we need more mergers and acquisitions of banks,” he opined.

However, Pandé said that mergers and acquisitions can happen only if bankers, especially the promoters of banks, shed their egos and put the welfare of the industry rather than themselves at the centre, and take the initiative to lower the number of banks, make them stronger and better, lower overhead costs and ensure greater outreach and diversity.
“Meanwhile, the government and NRB should also provide more incentives to quicken the process of consolidation in the banking sector,” added Pandé.
Similarly, Pandé also urged banks to keep pace with rapid advancements in technology and come up with new products in tune with the times. “If banks just continue to stick to traditional banking, they will face difficulties in the future.”
Pandé, who categorised life into three phases — learning, earning and giving — said he has entered the third phase and will devote his time, energy and funds in promoting arts and culture, which ‘should be preserved for the future generations’.

A 400/200-kVA high-voltage Dhalkebar substation is scheduled to start operations from January.
Once the substation comes into operation, it will be able to transmit cross-border electricity as well as strengthen the domestic distribution system. The gas insulated substation (GIS) is the only substation that is being built with the
sole investment of the government. GIS is a high voltage substation in which the major structures are contained in a sealed environment with sulphur hexafluoride gas as the insulating medium.
According to Kul Man Ghising, managing director of Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), after the completion of the substation, it will be able to export and import up to 1,000 megawatts of electricity to and from India.
As per him, this substation will be the sole hub of the country’s East-West electricity transmission and will be the biggest ever substation to carry out power trade with India. “The substation will help to transmit generated electricity from 456-megawatt Upper Tamakoshi and other major hydropower projects that are connected to the New-Khimti Substation.”

“With the 456MW Upper Tamakoshi hydropower project scheduled to be completed by ongoing fiscal year, Nepal will have surplus electricity from next fiscal and the Dhalkebar substation will help in the trade of electricity with India and also open the way for energy banking with the southern neighbour,” Ghising further said.
NEA is installing transformers with total capacity of 945kVA at the substation. It plans to distribute electricity in the domestic market and export surplus energy through 400 kVA Dhalkebar-Muzzaffapur cross-border transmission line.
As per Ghising, the required equipment for the substation has already been delivered to the site and its construction is nearly complete.
Meanwhile, the construction work of 400 kVA cross-border transmission line has already been completed and the transmission line is currently being charged.
NEA is also constructing 400/220 kVA substations each in Hetauda of Makawanpur and Duhabi of Sunsari, with the aim to strengthen domestic demand and ensure uninterrupted power supply to major industrial areas in Tarai region.
The government is spending Rs two billion for the construction of the Dhalkebar substation. Indian construction firm ABB Substations Contracting India Pvt Ltd is building the project and NEA Engineering is providing counsel for the project.

The country’s second Integrated Check Post (ICP) in Biratnagar is expected to come into operation from next month.
The Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board (NITDB) officials informed that necessary infrastructure of the ICP on Nepal side has been completed and plans are afoot to operate it as soon as possible. The ICP is being constructed with the assistance of the Indian government.
“Though all physical infrastructure of the ICP in Biratnagar has been completed, the Indian side is yet to hand it over to Nepal,” informed Hari Krishna Mishra, deputy director of NITDB, adding that the ICP will start operation immediately after the Indian government hands it over to Nepal.
Similarly, the government is also yet to determine the inauguration and operation modality of the ICP in Biratnagar. However, discussions are under way to operate the ICP in similar model as the ICP which is in operation in Birgunj.
Likewise, high-level dignitaries of Nepal and India are expected to inaugurate the Biratnagar-based ICP. Recently, State Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supplies Moti Lal Dugad had announced that the Biratnagar ICP would be inaugurated by the executive heads of two countries.
The ICP in Biratnagar will offer an effective platform for traders for trade logistics. It will be equipped with customs, immigration, quarantine, banks, warehouse, litigation shed and parking that are required for the clearance of goods and movement of people from a single location, thereby reducing trading cost for traders.
The private sector is eagerly awaiting for the Biratnagar ICP to come into operation as it is expected to help reduce the cost and time of country’s foreign trade. During a meeting with Minister Dugad, industrialists and traders of Biratnagar corridor had urged for immediate operationalisation of the ICP.
Indian contractor Dineshchandra R Agrawal Infracon Ltd constructed the ICP at almost Rs 2.1 billion. The construction of ICP in Biratnagar started in 2016 after the government handed over necessary land to the Indian authority.
Spread over 129 bighas of land, the Biratnagar ICP will also have a cargo building, terminal building and offer currency exchange service, internet, cold storage, CCTV, restaurants and banks, among other facilities.
Nepal’s first ICP at Birgunj-Raxaul border has been in operation since April 7, 2018. Indian government has assured Nepal to develop such ICPs in various other entry points to ease Nepal-India bilateral trade and also Nepal’s third country trade via India. Though Indian government will bear the cost of the construction of ICPs, Nepal will have to provide the necessary land.

Under the Foreign Commercial Air Transport Operators Operational Approval Rules (CCAR-129), the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) sent an official letter to NAC today allowing it to operate flights to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, informed Deepu Jwarchan, flight operation director of NAC.
As per him, the national flag carrier is preparing to operate flights from the first week of February. “As we have already completed the technical aspects, the procedures for marketing and booking tickets will be taken forth,” he said, adding that the date for the first flight to Guangzhou will be fixed soon.

NAC will operate three flights a week to Guangzhou.
NAC was informed on Tuesday that CAAC had withdrawn its decision to conduct a safety audit of the flag carrier. Earlier, CAAC had prevented NAC to operate flights to China citing air safety concerns raised by the European Union.
Jwarchan said that NAC aims to bring more tourists from China after expanding its service to the northern neighbour.
China is the second largest tourist market for Nepal.
According to the Department of Immigration, around 160,000 Chinese tourists visited Nepal in 2018, while a total of 134,281 Chinese tourists visited the country till October this year.

Kathmandu, December 4

The ongoing South Asian Games (SAG) 2019 has delighted tourism entrepreneurs in the country.
The occupancy of the hotels in Kathmandu valley as well as Janakpur and Pokhara has gone up significantly after SAG kicked off. As per the hoteliers, around 2,200 rooms have been booked from November 26 to December 10 for foreign players and delegates.
In this backdrop, the tourism entrepreneurs in the country have raised a voice for the promotion of sports tourism in the country.
“Nepal is already famous for adventure tourism that includes paragliding, skydiving, skiing, ice climbing and others. If we could organize international events related with such adventurous activities, Nepal can easily meet its target of bringing two million tourists next year or five million visitors by 2030,” said Khum Bahadur Subedi, president of Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal.
He further said that such activities would also help to promote Nepali destinations in the international arena.
Meanwhile, CN Pandey, president of Nepal Association of Tour and Travel Agents (NATTA), said that SAG 2019 has proved that Nepal has a good potential for sports tourism.
“SAG 2019 has helped to disseminate the information that Nepal is equipped to handle such international games,” he said, adding that such international games are good opportunity to welcome a large number of tourists in the country.

International games provide a major boost for tourism sector of the host country, as it marks the arrival of players, officials and spectators who come to participate and observe the event. During their stay, they are likely to visit different places and post updates on the social media.
“Such activities help to promote the destinations,” Pandey added.
“Moreover, word-of-mouth publicity is the most powerful tool for destination promotion.”
He, however, said that the government has to build more infrastructure to conduct such big events. “In this regard, the private sector is always ready to join hands with the government for development of the tourism sector.”
Amidst this, Sudhan Subedi, official of Nepal Tourism Board, said that Nepal is now gradually moving towards sports tourism. “Nepal has been organising international tournaments of golf since a very long time, but it has not been fully promoted,” he said. “Golf tournaments are a good opportunity to attract high-end tourists into the country.”
He further claimed that the country already has infrastructure to host international sport events, although there is room for improvement.
“Such events should be organised at least twice or thrice a year,” he added.
He further opined that the private sector also needs to provide quality services and come up with attractive tour packages for tourists coming to participate in such events.
Recently the government also announced that the world famous Formula E race will be held in Mustang in 2021.

Expatriates in Nepal have been facing difficulty bringing their spouses into the country owing to lack of legal provision, which could dissuade skilled foreign workers from coming to work in Nepal and also dent the flow of foreign direct investment into the country.
While the new Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act allows expats in the country to bring their children, it is mum on the provision for their spouses. This policy ambiguity has made it difficult for expats in Nepal to get visa for their spouses.
As per the record of the Department of Industry, since the new FITTA was introduced on 27 March 2018, more than 10 foreign expats have lodged complaints at the department seeking simplification of the procedures for getting visa for their spouses. The Department of Industry has notified the Department of Immigration about the issue and is seeking a feasible way out.
Some staffers of a famous multinational software development company recently reported problems in getting visa recommendation for their spouses. “The company established its regional base in Nepal last year, but now we are facing major hassles in bringing spouses of expats,” said a Nepali representative of the company, seeking anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to media.
According to the source, the company executives are now wondering whether to continue their business in Nepal or shift their investment to another country.
Stating that such issues need to be addressed promptly and seriously by the authorities concerned, the representative added, “The government’s apathy to such matters can hinder its aim of increasing the flow of foreign direct investment and propelling the economy towards double digit growth.”
To attract foreign investment in the country, the government has introduced or amended a number of laws such as the Industrial Enterprises Act, Special Economic Zone Act and Public-Private Partnership and Investment Act.
Udaya Kumar Gupta, head of Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Section at the Department of Industry, acknowledged facing problems when making recommendations for visas of expats’ spouses.
“We’ll soon introduce a regulation based on FITTA, but to address this issue, the act itself needs to be amended.” In other words, expats are likely to continue to face hassles bringing their spouses to Nepal for a while. This is because the Parliament needs to give a go-ahead to the amendment of any act tabled by the related ministry.
According to Gupta, the Department of Immigration has been issuing visas for spouses of expats as per the law at present since the Department of Industry is unable to make the recommendation based on the existing FITTA. Gupta added that the Department of Industry had already held a discussion with its line ministry, but failed to come up with a concrete solution. “We plan to discuss the issue with the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs soon to find a way out.”

The programme was organised on August 16 and 17 at Kanjirowa National Secondary School in collaboration with Robotics Association of Nepal (RAN) and Nepal Robotics Project, USA, according to a press release issued by the organiser.

The main aim of the training was to promote STEM — focusing on both the practical and theoretical aspects of robotics in Nepal, reads the statement. As many as 28 participants from 18 schools were involved in learning about the fundamentals of STEM education, drone making, aerodynamics, principles of flying, among others.
Kapil Dev Regmi, Chairman of Kanjirowa School, highlighted that Nepal’s education system required a practical approach to encourage the students for innovation and research rather than promoting rote learning. He was hopeful that such training will be given priority in more schools in future.
Participating teachers had an opportunity to interact with one another and share their experiences on the condition of STEM education in Nepal. The programme was led by some innovative engineers having extensive knowledge of robotics and latest technological advancements in the field.
Michael Kronmiller from Nepal Robotics Project, US, Aliyah Pandoliff from Kashmir World Foundation, US, and Prof Sandra Magnus, former NASA Scientist and Astronaut sent messages for the success of the programme and expressed their interests to work further with Kanjirowa in STEM education in the future too.

Nepali students, who wish to pursue non-academic courses, like vocational education or language courses in countries such as Australia and Japan, will not be allowed to do so from now onwards, thanks to the government’s radical move aimed at curtailing the rights of high school graduates to make choices. What’s more, students who have not completed Grade XII will not be allowed to study abroad.
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology published a notice today stating that students who have completed Grade XII or equivalent will be given ‘no objection letters’ to study abroad only if they intend to pursue academic courses of bachelor’s level or above.
Students cannot study abroad without obtaining ‘no objection letters’. These letters are also essential to get foreign currency exchange facility.

“We will issue no objection letters even to those who wish to pursue technical and vocational education, language courses and academic bridge courses, which are similar to language courses. But those students will have to provide evidence to substantiate they will get enrolled in a university to pursue academic courses after completing vocational or language courses,” said MoEST Under-secretary Maheshwor Sharma.
This move will largely affect students intending to study in Australia. Many Australia-bound Nepali students join technical and vocational institutions. This is common among those pursuing nursing.
Technical and vocational education, which is a non-academic course, generally prepares students for the job market, as it is designed by conducting studies on the needs of several industries. Countries such as Australia, Germany and Switzerland are well known for their technical and vocational education courses.
The latest move will also hit students who leave for Japan to pursue language courses. Many of them have not even passed Grade XII.
The latest provision introduced by the government clearly states that students will not be given permission to study abroad if they have not completed Grade XII. At present, not many students prefer to study abroad before passing Grade XII, but the new provision prevents parents who can afford to, or students who wish to, from doing so.
“The new provisions were introduced on the basis of the law which states that students can only get enrolled in foreign institutions if they intend to pursue higher education,” said Sharma. He added, “We now define higher education as tertiary education and not education attained in Grade XI and XII.” Earlier, the government used to define education provided in grades XI and XII as higher education. This has changed after the government started recognising grades XI and XII as a part of high school.
“The government should not have introduced such a provision without holding consultation with stakeholders. This blanket provision will not do good to students planning to study abroad. Students should be allowed to go abroad if they can attain quality education,” said Kedar Bhakta Mathema, former vice-chancellor of Tribhuvan University.

Loughlin, who starred in the television sitcom “Full House,” and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli filed papers in federal court in Boston waiving their personal appearances at an arraignment hearing and asking to have not guilty pleas entered on their behalf.
They are among 50 people accused of participating in a massive scheme that allowed wealthy parents to use cheating and $25 million in bribes to help their children secure spots at well-known universities like Yale, Georgetown and USC.
California college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer pleaded guilty in March to charges that helped parents facilitate cheating on college entrance exams and bribed coaches at universities to falsely present their children as athletic recruits.
Prosecutors allege that Loughlin (54) and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USC’s crew team, even though they did not row competitively, to help them gain admission.
Loughlin and Giannulli provided Singer photographs of their daughters in order to create fake athletic profiles for them, which a USC athletics official in exchange for bribes then used to support recruiting them, prosecutors said.
The couple and several other parents were originally charged in March with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Prosecutors secured an indictment on April 9 that included an additional charge of conspiring to commit money laundering.
Several other parents charged alongside Loughlin and Giannulli also filed papers seeking to waive appearing at an arraignment and have not guilty pleas entered for them. A federal magistrate judge granted their requests on Monday.
In all, 33 parents have been charged in the college admissions scandal. Of those, 13 have agreed to plead guilty, including “Desperate Housewives” TV star Felicity Huffman. She is scheduled to plead guilty on May 21.

ULYSSES, KANSAS: A 16-year-old Kansas boy will soon earn his high school diploma — and a few days later he’ll travel to Harvard to collect his bachelor’s degree.
Ulysses High School senior Braxton Moral will attend both commencement ceremonies in May, becoming the only student to successfully pursue a four-year high school degree and a bachelor’s degree from Harvard at the same time, The Hutchinson News reported .
Harvard has changed the rules, Braxton’s father Carlos Moral said, so his son will “the one and only” reaching that milestone. Braxton Moral will be 17 when he gets his diplomas.
Carlos Moral said they began to realize their son was special when he was in the third grade.
“They told us: ‘You need to do something. He’s not just gifted. He’s really, really gifted,’” he said.
Braxton Moral skipped the fourth grade.
The Ulysses school district allowed him to take some high school classes while he was still in middle school. Before high school he took a class offered at Fort Hays State University. Then he was admitted into Harvard.
Braxton Moral simultaneously studied at the high school and the Harvard Extension School. The program typically serves adults who work and can’t attend classes on campus full time.
Ulysses High School math teacher Patsy Love served as the proctor for the Harvard program, administering Moral’s tests in Kansas. Moral spent the summer before his junior year at Harvard’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
“We constantly are monitoring Braxton to make sure he is not too overwhelmed,” said Julie Moral, Braxton Moral’s mother. “No achievement is worth him being unhappy.”
Braxton Moral is on track to graduate from the Bachelor of Liberal Arts program, with a major government and a minor in English, said Harry Pierre, associate director of communications for Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education.
Braxton Moral said he hopes to attend Harvard Law School next.
“Politics is end game for me,” he said, though he’s still too young to vote.

The complaint was forwarded to Tribhuvan University with priority. It was later forwarded to the TU Office of the Controller of Examinations by Information and Public Relations Division of the University.
Consequently, all colleges in the eastern region of the country have been directed to ensure availability of the forms inside college premises. Joint Controller of Examinations, Arjun Bikram Khadka, shared this information.

On-the-spot interview with top IT and engineering companies of Nepal was the main highlight of the event.
Dakshina Shrestha, Associate Professor and Head of Training and Placement Unit said, “The event was organised with an objective of helping students liaise with the industry and job market to make a smooth transition from college to corporate life. Many graduates were placed by online interviews. Overall, it was a win-win situation for both companies and graduates. The feedback we received was excellent. We were requested to organise such event every year.”
Sixteen of the leading Nepali companies working in the field of information technology and engineering like Javra Software, Leapfrog, Vianet, Karkhana, Fuse Machine, Wikimedians Nepal, among others had participated in the event.
One of the representatives from Javra Software, Technical Manager Dev Narayan said, “When I came here I expected a huge crowd, and students seeking jobs. That is what happened. I feel this is a good initiative taken by the college. I feel, definitely, a lot of engineers will be selected through the event.”

BOSTON: The latest crop of US Rhodes scholars has more women than any other single class, and almost half of this year’s recipients of the prestigious scholarship to Oxford University in England are either immigrants or first-generation Americans, the Rhodes Trust announced Sunday.
Among the 32 winners is Harvard University senior Jin Park, the first recipient covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation.
Park, 22, of the New York City borough of Queens, arrived from South Korea with his parents when he was 7, studied molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, and founded a nonprofit to help undocumented students apply to college.
He hopes to become an immigrant advocate, saying it’s important for him to use the opportunity to better others, not just himself.
“When you grow up as an undocumented immigrant in America, that understanding that your talents don’t really belong to you in the traditional sense, that you have to share the fruits of your labor with others, that’s just something you learn,” Park said.
Alaleh Azhir, a 21-year old senior at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, emigrated from Iran when she was 14 — and is also one of 21 female scholars named Sunday. The New York City resident hopes eventually to become a doctor and will study women’s and reproductive health at Oxford.
“I’m just a passionate advocate for women in general and that’s mostly because of my background,” she said. “I thought that the way I could advocate for women could be by advocating for their health.”
At Chapman University in Southern California, Vidal Arroyo, 21, reflected on his unlikely path to becoming his school’s first Rhodes Scholar.
“As a Latino, a first-generation college student, and a train commuter to college, winning this scholarship means so much to me because it sheds hope for students from backgrounds like my own who have to overcome multiple barriers in pursuit of a higher education and a better future,” said Arroyo, who plans to study engineering science at Oxford.
And Eren Orbey, a 23-year-old senior at Yale University in Connecticut, whose parents emigrated from Turkey, hopes studying at Oxford will bring greater “context and clarity” to his writing. He is a regular contributor to The New Yorker magazine and is working on a book about his father, who was slain in Ankara when he was just 3, and the killer.
“I’m interested in studying the ethics of revenge and forgiveness,” Orbey said Sunday by email. “I think that our culture and media coverage often condescend to immigrants and survivors of trauma. In my writing, I hope to recast tragedy and strife as occasions for growth and heroism.”
The US Rhodes scholars join a separate, international group of scholars representing more than 60 countries.
Rhodes Scholarships provide all expenses for at least two years of study at Oxford. They were created in 1902 in the will of Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman and Oxford alum who was a prime minister of the Cape Colony in present-day South Africa.

LONDON: Football legend David Beckham has visited Indonesia – where one in three children have been physically attacked in school – to see how his charity, the 7 Fund, is combating bullying.
The A-list celebrity and former England captain launched the fund to protect the world’s most vulnerable youngsters in 2015 with the United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF).
“I feel very proud to see how my 7 Fund is helping UNICEF tackle bullying and violence in schools in Indonesia, and is ultimately keeping children, especially girls, safe in their schools so they can continue their education,” he said.
Bullying and violence are among the biggest worries for young people in Indonesia, with more than 1 in 5 teens aged 13 to 15 – or 18 million students – experiencing it, leading to mental health problems and school dropouts, UNICEF said.
The 7 Fund teaches children who have been bullied and former bullies to educate others and trains teachers to keep children safe. Bullying has been reduced by almost a third among the 7,000 children who have taken part in pilot programmes, it said.
“I spent time with an amazing young girl – Sripun – who was voted by her peers to take part in an anti-bullying programme to help stop violence in schools,” Beckham said in a statement.
“This has increased her confidence and she’s hopeful that other students won’t have to go through the same bullying experience she did.”
The fund — named after Beckham’s lucky number on his England and Manchester United shirts — focuses on children at risk of violence, abuse or disease.
Beckham, a father of four, has said that he hopes his own children will be proud of his work with the 7 Fund, which also has projects in Indonesia, Nepal, Uganda and El Salvador.

Vice-chairman of National Planning Commission Swarnim Wagle has said that setting the educational agenda has been a great challenge in the country.
Speaking at the 18th Annual General Meeting of Educational Journalist Group here today, he said the government had to give priority to education.
“The quality of education should be improved now that the local levels are responsible for handling and managing school education,” he said.
Around 40 per cent of budget is being sent to the local levels and preparations are also on to hand over different projects currently being handled by different non-governmental organisations to the local levels.
Similarly, former education minister Dhaniram Paudel said despite the handover of the education system to the local levels, the Ministry of Education, Department of Education and district education offices should handle the education system.
Madhu Prasad Regmi, secretary at the Ministry of Education, said 23 responsibilities of the education sector had been given to the local levels without hampering the educational system.
As all the basic and secondary schools are being handled by the local levels it will be easy to manage resources for the education sector from local resources, he added.

Kathmandu
Teachers are guides for students providing students with valuable knowledge, which help students to excel in their studies as well as life in general. Teachers with decades of teaching experience in various colleges share important tips.

Study on a regular basis
Teachers suggest that students should give regular time to their studies. However, they say there is no fixed hours that they should set aside.
“Regular reading is a must,” says Bharat Kumar Bhattarai, who has 30 years of experience as a Nepali lecturer. He suggests students to prepare notes right from the beginning of the academic year and go through it regularly.
Saroj Pyakurel, Accounting lecturer in different colleges in Kathmandu, says that there is no fixed hours that students should give to their studies. However, according to Pya-kurel, who has 14 years of teaching experience, students should give as much time as they can daily, in which they would be able to understand the lessons taught every day. “Students themselves should decide how much time they should give regularly on a daily basis so they understand the lessons,” he suggests. He stresses that during holidays too, students should set aside at least three hours for revisions.
Educationist Prof Dr Bidya Nath Koirala says that the time students should give to their studies depends upon their nature. Some students learn fast and some slowly, so students themselves should find out how much time they should give to their studies according to their learning ability.

Tips for exam preparation
Educators suggest that students should go through all the topics of a subject in order to obtain good marks in exams.  Nepali lecturer Bhattarai suggests students to divide time according to the importance and marks of the topics. “For the exams you should not study selecting a few topics, but study all the topics in the text with the intention to understand each topic thoroughly.”
He says that students who select only few a topics to study for exams will not be able to do well. “Every topic in course is inter-related, and if students do not understand earlier topics, they will not be clear about the next chapter too,” he opines.
He also suggests students to prepare for exams by noting down important points of each chapter. Besides this, he says that students, who prepare notes from the beginning, will score good marks in exams as they will have already gained a deep knowledge of each chapter. However, he suggests avoiding using guides books and guess papers. “Students depending upon guide books and guess papers will ruin themselves,” he informs as “guide book writers are not responsible ones; they take it as a job and they are not responsible towards students’ progress.”

Be proactive
Students should not only depend upon the teachers’ notes but should also work on their own by studying reference materials, books from the library and doing online researches, as per the teachers.
“Teachers are limited within the circle of their knowledge and education, so students should also study and prepare from books by various writers. This will broaden their knowledge,” says Bhattarai.
Pyakurel also argues that students should not only depend upon their teachers and course books. “Students can benefit much from YouTube and Google as thousands of study materials are available there.”
He further says, “The mind is always motivated by desire, so students should also research on issues in which their interests lie.”

Questioning mind
Prof Dr Koirala says that raising questions is the most important feature of a learner. He says that students should always have questions in their mind and ask questions to themselves in order to learn. On any topic or issue, a student should ask questions: Why it is so? How did it happen? What is the mechanism behind it? How is it related with me? Raising such questions will make a student understand topics analytically, he says.

Clear vision
Sociology lecturer Uttam Prasad Devkota says that students should have a goal. Devkota has 13 years of experience in teaching.  “It is not that you study BBA because you completed your plus two level. Students should have a clear vision about their field of interest and about what they want to be in future,” points out Devkota. He adds that the students should not be limited to their course but should broaden their horizon by gaining knowledge on social, cultural, political and economic conditions of the country and people. Students should always notice what is happening in their society and country. This will make them explore the possibility of the current subject they are studying. They should not only prepare to get good results in exams but think of study and learning as a regular process, Devkota adds.

Kathmandu
Teej, one of the greatest festivals for Hindu women, is here. Students also celebrate this festival, and even if they don’t, they are affected by the festivities surrounding it as people from their friend circle or family members celebrate it. Sharing their views about this festival, they admit that the study environment college and homes is affected by the festival.
In celebratory mood
For most students the best aspect of this festival is that it strengthens the bond between female members in society as they meet and share their feelings with each other. They add that the singing, dancing and the celebration part of the festival is what they enjoy the most.
Nisha Khatiwada, a resident of Kapan and a Vth semester student of Bachelor of Public Health at the Karnali College of Health Sciences in Battisputali, says that it is fascinating to see women in red, dancing and singing folk songs on streets, going to temples in a holy and fasting mood.
Class environment
Rebecca Maghariya, a IVth year student of Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) at the Shanker Dev Campus in Putalisadak, says that as their college has no uniform, students come wearing red and green, or colourful kurta and also with mehendi on their hands two weeks prior to Teej. Maghariya is from Kailali and is currently residing in Thankot.
Maghariya’s classmate Pratiksha Gautam says Teej becomes a subject of all talks among classmates. Gautam hails from Rukum and is residing in Dillibazar. According to her, kind of clothes to wear and songs to sing during Teej become the main topics of talk in class starting a few weeks before the festival.
Effects on study
The students also admit they are distracted from their studies during the festival due to many reasons.
Neeru Poudel, a IVth Year BBS student at Shanker Dev Campus, says that the festival affected her when she was studying in BBS Ist Year as the board exam was on the same day. She was distracted from her studies as there was a celebratory environment at her home. According to her, this year too the BBS Ist Year board exams were scheduled on Teej but was postponed due to floods in Tarai. Poudel is from Syangja and residing in New Baneshwor. She says that music and other noise from Darr events at a nearby complex could be heard from her room. This disturbs her while doing her college assignments.
Umesh Bhakt Joshi, a IInd Year student of Bachelor of Law (LLB) at the Nepal Law Campus at Pradarshanimarg, says that around 50 per cent of female classmates in his class do not attend class from around two weeks prior to Teej. Joshi, from Bajhang and residing in Kirtipur, says almost all his female classmates are absent from Darr eating day till Rishi Panchami. He opines that as half the number of students remain absent, their lecturers show no interest in teaching and usually postpone classes for a week. There is also less possibility of female lecturers holding classes on those days, informs Joshi, adding that student unions in the college have organised Darr programme for students this year too as in previous years.
Shanta Bahadur Tamang of the Nepal Law Campus however, says that Teej celebration should not affect students regarding their studies as it depends upon students themselves on how to manage time. According to him, if some days are to be spent in celebrations, students should study those chapters early on or give extra time to the same after the festival ends.
Superstition
Apart from these aspects of Teej, Khatiwada said she does not believe bathing and performing other rituals on Rishi Panchami will purify women and earn them penance from the so-called mistakes they may have committed being and making others impure during periods. Such superstitions push women to an inferior position in society, she adds.

67,https://thehimalayantimes.com/education/the-hostel-life/,"Hasana Lawaju talks to college students who are living in hostels as they pursue their studies and finds out why students find it advantageous to stay in one


Hostel provides a good environment for studies — serious students take the best advantage while living in hostels. While there are the fun and challenges of living in a hostel, these are also the best places for students to live while pursuing their higher studies. Most students agree that they are motivated to study while saving their time as they attend their colleges while living in hostel.
Conducive study environment
Some students find hostel environment motivational to concentrate in their studies, especially during exams.  “Every student staying in a hostel usually has exams at the same time, and thus all are studying during that time,” says Bishwadeep Tamang, a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering, Bhaktapur. Tamang, who hails from Sankhuwasabha, is staying at Hostel Libali — a private hostel in Bhaktapur.
Tamang’s classmate as well as roommate Manish Dhakal echoes a similar view — “when a  friend is studying for exams at hostel, a competitive spirit develops among other friends, and as a result everyone is motivated to study”.
The motivation to study comes from seniors at her hostel for Manisha Khadka, Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) VIth Semester student.  Khadka, who studies at Padmakanya Multiple Campus, Baghbazar and stays in the college’s Pragya Chhatrawas, shares, “When I see my seniors — especially Master’s level students — studying sincerely, I am inspired to study properly.”
Living in a hostel with classmates becomes advantageous, especially when one misses a class or does not understand the topic taught in the classroom.  “Whenever I do not understand any topic taught by the teachers, I can consult my roommates or other friends in the hostel who have a better understanding of the topic,” points out Kshitij Dahal, BE (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering. Dahal also resides in Hostel Libali.
However, Sharmila Upadhyaya staying at Padma Girls Hostel in Pulchowk, has a different experience. Initially, when she started living in the hostel three-and-a-half years ago, it was difficult for her to adjust because she was not used to studying in group. But with time, she has gotten used to it.
Upadhyaya, BE (Computer Engineering) VIIIth Semester student at the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk,  shares her hostel offers a good environment for students as it “only selects students after checking their academic performances”.
Life made easier
Khadka’s hostel is next to her college premises. “It takes me only a few minutes to reach my hostel. So, my time is not wasted in travelling,” says Khadka, who hails from Butwal. Living near the college, she claims to utilise most of her time for studies.
Had Dhakal, whose house is in Kapan, chosen to commute to his college in Bhaktapur from his home “I would have spent at least four hours daily just travelling in bus”. Thanks to his decision to stay in a hostel, he is able to save valuable time.
The students also need not cook or do laundry and cleaning as most hostels provide students with food, laundry and other services.

“We do not need to cook, wash dishes or clothes, and it is convenient for us,” Tamang shares.
Along with that other facilities are available in the hostels. For instance, the three-and-a- half storey Pragya Chhatrawas has made one study hall available in each floor for students along with Wi-Fi facility, as per Geeta Tandukar, a third class officer at General Administration Division of the Padmakanya Multiple Campus.
Kutumba Boys Hostel, Jawalakhel receives students’ report cards from their respective colleges. “We wake the students up early in the morning, monitor their studies, talk to the parents if their children are not concentrating in their studies or have poor academic performances,” hostel coordinator Bandana Khatri reveals.
More than studies
Be it a hostel run by the college or a private one, most make students’ academics the priority. But they also provide opportunities for students to have fun. As such, the occasional celebrations in hostels are the best moments for students like Khadka. They celebrate Teachers’ Day where they offer treats to their teachers and also celebrate birthday of their hostel warden, as per Khadka.
Hostel wardens too support the students in such endeavours. Rakesh Machamasi, Warden of Hostel Libali informs, “We prepare delicacies like Dahi Chiura, Khir, Yomari et cetera  on different occasions for the hostel students and we all celebrate together. Our students find such celebrations interesting.”
Dissatisfaction 
Most students agree that hostels provide them with a good study environment. However, they have some dissatisfaction too, mostly about the food served.
“Sometimes, the food served by our hostel is not hygienic. At times I have found insects and hair in the food, though it does happen always,” complains Khadka.
Dahal has some objection with the meat-policy of his hostel. “Our hostel serves meat every Wednesday. But if I do not feel like eating on that day and want to have meat on some other day, that is not possible,” Dahal argues.
But Upadhyaya puts forth a different opinion. “It is not what we want to eat, but what is available. If we do not eat properly, no one in the hostel will convince us to eat. As such habits like not eating on time  can even affect our health. So, rather than complaining, we should learn to take care ourselves,” she opines.

KATHMANDU: After successfully performing in Brisbane, Darwin and Adelaide, Nepal’s popular folk-rock band, Nepathya, rocked the audience at Tasmania Hall, in Hobart of Australia, on Sunday evening.
As the clock struck 7:00, Nepathya played their hit music video ‘Sa Karnali‘ and new song ‘Sanjirakha‘ written by poet Tusli Diwas on a big screen before the band members took the centre stage at the full house hall.
During the show, Nepathya, played their old and new songs to entertain audiences in their maiden performance in Hobart.
“Along with this much-awaited concert, Nepathya also brought festive mood and patriotism among Nepalis living in Hobart,” Rojina Tamrakar said after attending the concert.
She further said they were grateful to the band for creating such an ambience in a foreign land.
As usual, Gurung was supported by Dhurba Lama on drums, Suraj Thapa on keyboards, Subin Shakya on bass guitar, Niraj Gurung on guitars and Shanti Raymajhi on madal.
After the Hobart show, Nepathya’s concert entourage will head to Sydney to perform on December 14, the band said. Nepathya is currently touring Australia for the fifth time with new music series.

69,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/frozen-2-leads-box-office-again-playmobil-flops/,"NEW YORK: “Frozen 2” blanketed multiplexes for the third straight weekend, continuing its reign at No. 1 with $34.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.
The Walt Disney Co animated sequel has already grossed $919.7 million worldwide. It will soon become the sixth Disney release this year to cross $1 billion, a record sure to grow to seven once “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” hits theatres later this month. Early next week, Disney will cross $10 billion at the global box office this year.

But the weekend overall at the box office was yet another disappointing one for the movie industry. A handful of under-performing releases and a relatively thin wide-release schedule hasn’t helped the 5.6% slide in domestic ticket sales from last year, according to data firm Comscore.
This weekend produced an outright flop in “Playmobil: The Movie,” the week’s only new wide release. The STX Films release was never expected to do well, but it bombed so thoroughly that it will rank among the worst-performing wide-releases ever. It grossed $668,000 in 2,337 venues, giving it a per-theatre average of just $286.
A handful of companies combined to produce the $75 million French film, including Wild Bunch and Pathe.
The top five films were almost unchanged from last weekend.
Rian Johnson’s acclaimed, star-studded whodunit “Knives Out” remained in second place with $14.2 million, declining a modest 47% in its second week of release. With $63.5 million cumulatively and $124.1 million worldwide, the Lionsgate release has been one of the season’s bright spots.
So has James Mangold’s “Ford v Ferrari,” which stayed in third place with $6.5 million over its fourth weekend. The racing drama, starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, has sped to a global take of $168 million for Disney, which acquired the film’s original studio, 20th Century Fox, earlier this year. The film cost about $100 million to make.
Melina Matsoukas’ outlaw romance “Queen & Slim” moved up to fourth in its second week with $6.5 million, swapping places with Marielle Heller’s Mister Rogers drama “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” ($5.2 million in its third weekend).
Todd Haynes’ true-story legal drama “Dark Waters,” starring Mark Ruffalo as a defense attorney who takes on the DuPont chemical company, expanded nationwide to 2,011 theatres. The Focus Features release made $4.1 million.
Celine Sciamma’s acclaimed period romance “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” opened at two locations with a very strong $33,552 per-theatre average. Neon will release the French film wider in February.
Some of the weekend’s most widespread movie watching may have been on Netflix, though the streaming service doesn’t disclose viewership tallies or box-office receipts.
After a three-week theatrical run, Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story,” one of the year’s most critically acclaimed films, began streaming Friday. On Friday, Nielsen said Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” last weekend drew an average audience of 13.6 million viewers from Nov. 27 to Dec. 1. Netflix has said Nielsen numbers, which only estimate US viewership, reflect an incomplete picture.
Amazon likewise didn’t release ticket sales for “The Aeronauts,” which opened in 52 theatres over the weekend. Tom Harper’s film, which cost $40 million to make, stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as 19th century balloonists.
A week before it opens in North America, Sony’s “Jumanji: The Next Level” debuted in 18 international countries where it made $52.5 million. The sequel to 2017’s “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” which grossed $962 million worldwide, is expected to lead the box office next weekend.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at US and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

“Frozen 2,” $34.7 million ($90.2 million international).
“Knives Out,” $14.2 million ($18 million international).
“Ford v Ferrari,” $6.5 million ($8.3 million international).
“Queen & Slim,” $6.5 million.
“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” $5.2 million.
“Dark Waters,” $4.1 million.
“21 Bridges,” $2.9 million.
“Playing With Fire,” $2 million.
“Midway,” $1.9 million.
“Joker,” $1 million.

72,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/marriage-story-dominates-gotham-awards-with-4-wins/,"NEW YORK: Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” was the resounding winner at the IFP Gotham Awards, taking four awards including best feature at the annual New York awards-season kickoff.
By the end of the night on Monday, Baumbach, having long ago exhausted his one prepared speech, stood at the podium exhorting cast members Adam Driver and Laura Dern to lend him help. Having already given their own speeches — Driver for best actor, Dern as a tribute honoree — they demurred, content to watch Baumbach squirm again while he improvised a few remarks.

Baumbach turned, ultimately, to his actors — “My special effect, my everything is the cast,” he said — and to Netflix for what he called its “unconditional” support of his film, a portrait of divorce starring Driver and Scarlett Johansson. Earlier, Baumbach thanked Netflix, too, for saving the Manhattan single-screen Paris Theatre, which the streaming company purchased last week.
Praise for Netflix and its chief content creative officer Ted Sarandos, who was also in attendance, was a common refrain throughout the evening. The streaming service, which filled up numerous tables at the banquet at Cipriani’s Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, also celebrated wins for Ava DuVernay’s Central Park Five series “When They See Us,” (DuVernay was additionally singled out for tribute) and the documentary “American Factory.”
The Gothams, now in their 29th year, is the premier New York gala for independent film, a kind of earlier East Coast corollary to Los Angeles’ Independent Film Spirit Awards in February. Put on by the nonprofit Independent Film Project with nominees selected by committees, Gotham winners can diverge from seasonal favourites. Last year, Chloe Zhao’s lyrical Western “The Rider” took the best feature.
But a recent stretch of Gotham winners went on to land best picture at the Academy Awards, including Barry Jenkins’ “Moonlight,” Tom McCarthy’s “Spotlight” and Alejandro Inarritu’s “Birdman.”
And “Marriage Story,” which begins streaming Friday after playing for several weeks in theaters, seems sure to continue a long march through awards season. Acclaim has been heaped on its leads and its ensemble, and it’s been celebrated as a crowning achievement for the 50-year-old Baumbach.
While not a surprise to others, the most shocked winner of the evening was easily Awkwafina, who took the best actress for her performance in Lulu Wang’s family drama “The Farewell.”
“Oh my god. I never won anything. I can’t even win an argument in the Instagram comments,” said Awkwafina.
A handful of movies up for best feature — “Uncut Gems” with Adam Sandler, “Hustlers” with Jennifer Lopez — went home emptyhanded. Trey Edward Schultz’ ambitious family melodrama “Waves,” also up for best feature, scored an award for Taylor Russell as a breakthrough actor.
The Gotham Awards liberally sprinkle in tributes throughout the ceremony. This year’s honorees included Dern, DuVernay, Sam Rockwell, FilmNation chief executive Glen Basner and Jason DaSilva, a filmmaker and disability rights activist. DaSilva’s Emmy-winning documentary “When I Walk” chronicles his own experience with multiple sclerosis.
DuVernay shared her tips for directing, among them: treat actors and crew the same, don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know” and change your socks at lunchtime.
Both Baumbach and Greta Gerwig presented Dern with her award, donning what they called “Laura Dern sweaters” for the occasion. The two filmmakers, aside from living together as a couple with a son, share Dern in their latest movies. In “Marriage Story,” Dern plays a ruthless divorce attorney. In Gerwig’s “Little Women” (an upcoming Sony Pictures release ineligible for the Gothams), she plays Louisa May Alcott’s benevolent matriarch Marmee.
Gerwig and Baumbach swapped their speeches, which resulted in Baumbach declaring that he loved Dern “even more than Leonardo DiCaprio, who I sincerely believed I would someday marry.”
The Gothams reliably serve as pep rallies for independent cinema and those that toil in the ever-threatened lower-budgeted realm of moviemaking. Presenter Natasha Lyonne, whose Netflix series “Russian Doll” was nominated for best breakthrough series in episodes less than 40 minutes, evoked that sense of indie pride with more than a touch of sarcasm.
“If there’s one thing everyone in the room can agree on,” Lyonne said while presenting, “it’s that we can never have enough Batman movies.”

73,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/the-who-plans-1st-cincinnati-area-concert-since-79-tragedy/,"CINCINNATI: The rock band The Who announced Tuesday night it will play its first Cincinnati area concert since 11 fans died 40 years ago in a pre-show stampede.
The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame band will play April 23 at Northern Kentucky University’s BB&T Arena, across the Ohio River 7 miles south of the Dec 3, 1979, concert site, where another two dozen people were injured Dec. 3, 1979, amid confusion and lack of preparation for thousands of fans lined up for hours for first-come seats.

The announcement came after WCPO-TV in Cincinnati aired a Tuesday night documentary featuring interviews with lead singer Roger Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend, the remaining original members of the British band that emerged in the 1960s featuring songs of youthful rebellion such as “My Generation” and its “Summertime Blues” cover.
Both have said they’ve been haunted by the tragedy. Townshend recently told The Associated Press he was looking forward to discussing it in Cincinnati.
“Now we can have a conversation about it when we go back,” Townshend said.
“We will meet people and we’ll be there. We’ll be there. That’s what’s important,” he said. “I’m so glad that we’ve got this opportunity to go back.”
The band is adding the concert to its “Moving On!” tour 2020 dates.
The Who said it will donate a portion of proceeds from the Cincinnati area concert to a memorial scholarship fund benefiting students in the Cincinnati suburb of Finneytown. Daltrey visited a Finneytown High School memorial site in 2018 and the band has for years supported the scholarship effort there. Three of the 11 killed, including two 15-year-old girls who were the youngest victims, had attended Finneytown High.
The band didn’t know about the tragedy until the concert was ending. Longtime manager Bill Curbishley had made the decision to have the show go on, warning Cincinnati authorities that they wouldn’t be able to control the crowd if the concert was called off.
“Despite everything, I still feel inadequate,” he told WCPO. “I don’t know about the guys, but for me, I left a little bit of my soul in Cincinnati.”

Hit animated movie takes inspiration from Sámi culture
Sámi people live in northern Europe
“Frozen 2” dubbed in North Sámi, rare move for a blockbuster

OSLO: The sequel to Walt Disney Co’s 2013 hit animated musical “Frozen” is generating excitement among indigenous Sámi people in northern Europe, whose culture the movie has taken inspiration from.
“Frozen 2” debuted in US cinemas on Nov 22 and is progressively rolling out worldwide. On its debut weekend, it grossed $350 million, making it “the biggest opening ever for Walt Disney Animation (not including Pixar)”, according to Hollywood trade publication Variety. The movie opens in Norway on Christmas Day.

Norway inspired many elements of the first “Frozen” movie, such as character Anna’s dress or the architecture of the fictional kingdom of Arendelle.
The second film takes inspiration from the culture of the Sámi, an indigenous minority living across Norway, Sweden, Finland and northern Russia, who have faced discrimination against their language and culture.
In Norway, a state-appointed truth and reconciliation commission is investigating the discrimination perpetrated on minorities including the Sámi and Kven peoples.
“I am planning to see the movie again with my whole family,” said Aili Keskitalo, president of the consultative Sámi Parliament in Norway, who attended the film’s world premiere in Los Angeles with her 11-year-old daughter and set a scene from the movie as her Facebook profile picture.
“Frozen 2” sees Anna and sister Elsa head north of Arendelle to find out the truth about a mystery. They meet the Northuldra, who live closely with the reindeer. Reindeer herding is a traditional Sámi activity.
“Some of the beautiful costumes in the film took inspiration from our gákti. They also took inspiration from the guksi, our traditional wooden cup,” said Anne Lajla Utsi, a member of a Sámi advisory group that collaborated with the filmmakers.
“We felt they really listened and that it was very important to them to do this right,” Utsi, managing director of the International Sámi Film Institute, told Reuters.
Disney signed a contract with Sámi representatives to commit themselves to portray their culture respectfully. That included supporting the dubbing of the movie in North Sámi, the most spoken of the Sámi languages, and release it at the same time as the Norwegian version.
When Utsi posted a picture of the “Frozen 2” poster on Facebook with its Sámi title, “Jikŋon 2”, it went viral.
“My youngest daughter is really looking forward to watching the movie again in her language,” said Keskitalo.
“My elder daughters, who are 22 and 25 years old, are also very excited about seeing the movie. It is not often that we see a movie in North Sámi. I think a lot of adults will see the movie too.” (

75,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/k-pop-singer-sentenced-to-6-years-in-jail-for-rape-sharing-secret-sex-videos/,"SEOUL: A South Korean court sentenced a K-pop musician to six years in prison on Friday for raping a woman and distributing a video capturing the act in a case that drew attention to the darker side of the country’s lucrative entertainment industry.
Jung Joon-young, 30, was arrested in March. Choi Jong-hoon, 30, a former member of South Korean boy band FT Island, was also sentenced to five years in prison for the rape of the woman.
Both were members of online chat groups that shared secret sex tapes and made jokes about drugging and raping women, the Seoul Central District Court said.
Jung’s conviction also includes the illegal distribution of other videos he took secretly while having sex with women. The identities of the victims were suppressed to protect their privacy.
The court also sentenced each man to 80 hours in “sexual violence treatment” education.
“The defendants are well-known celebrities and friends, but the chat they’ve had showed that they simply considered women as objects of sexual pleasure, and committed crimes that were extremely serious,” Judge Kang Seong-soo said as he handed down the verdict.
“Strict punishment is inevitable as the damage inflicted has not properly been recovered and the victims demand harsh penalties.”
Jung admitted distributing the video and others he took, though he argued the sex was in all cases consensual. Choi denied raping the woman, and had argued that he did not remember having sex with her and that if he had, it was likely consensual.
Lawyers for Jung and Choi could not be reached for comment.
Their case was one of several scandals involving sex crimes and other illegal activity that revealed a dark side of an industry at the centre of the global K-pop craze.
Lee Seung-hyun, a former member of K-pop group Big Bang better known by the stage name Seungri, is also on trial over accusations he paid for prostitutes for foreign businessmen to drum up investment in his business.

Gao was filming a sports reality show in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo on Wednesday when he died. His agency, JetStar Entertainment, confirmed his death on its official Facebook page.
The 35-year-old was filming “Chase Me,” a Chinese variety series, when he reportedly fell while running. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to his agency.
The Taiwan-born Gao initially rose to fame by becoming the first Asian male model for the luxury brand Louis Vuitton. He acted in numerous television dramas and movies, including a role in the Hollywood film “The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.”
His body will be transported Wednesday to Taipei, Taiwan’s capital.

77,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/singer-goo-haras-death-shines-light-on-dark-side-of-k-pop/,"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA: The death of South Korean singer and actress Goo Hara, whose body was found at her home in Seoul this week, has again shone a spotlight on pressures that stars, especially females, face in the cutthroat K-pop industry and in deeply conservative South Korean society.
Goo’s death at age 28 came less than two months after the death of Choi Jin-ri, or Sulli, another K-pop star and Goo’s close friend. Experts say both Goo and Choi faced extensive cyberbullying and sexual harassment from the public and media throughout their careers, which took a toll on their mental health.

Police say they are still investigating Goo’s death and found a “pessimistic note” at her home.
Once popular mostly in Asia, K-pop has spread far beyond South Korea, thanks to wildly popular groups such as “BTS” and “Blackpink.”
Goo debuted in 2008 as part of the five-member girl group Kara, which shot almost immediately to fame and helped pioneer the K-pop global phenomenon.
She later launched a successful solo career in South Korea and Japan.
Sulli began her career around the same time as Goo, debuting as a member of the girl band f(x) in 2009. She also had multiple acting roles after stepping away from her singing career.
Goo made headlines when she took her former boyfriend, Choi Jong-bum, to court last year. Choi claimed to have been assaulted by her, while Goo accused him of threatening to release a sex video of her.
During the dispute, Goo’s Korean agency didn’t renew her contract. A court sentenced Choi to 1 ½ years in prison on charges of coercion and assaulting and blackmailing Goo. The jail term was suspended, keeping him out of prison. Choi appealed and the trial is still ongoing.
K-pop is highly competitive, with dozens of groups debuting each year. Industry experts have long warned about the dark side of the scandal-ridden industry. Aspiring artists, as young as their early teens, train for years. Only a few debuts and even fewer are commercially successful. The likelihood of their success increases if they sign with a handful of top entertainment agencies.
The industry is known to have strict rules for their stars — including dating bans, spartan training and diets, and sometimes slave-like and unfair contracts. Experts say the industry has additional requirements for its female artists, unspoken rules reflective of South Korea’s patriarchal society.
Park Hee-A, a K-pop journalist and writer of “Interviews with K-pop Stars,” said female stars are bound by rigid societal rules of femininity.
“Some female idol members have gotten ostracized for not smiling in a television show and reading a book about feminism that contradicts male-dominated patriarchal South Korean society,” Park told The Associated Press.
Expectations of purity and chastity govern women in South Korea. Goo faced a barrage of hate comments following media reports about the sex video despite her being the victim of revenge porn.
“The topic of sex is taboo in South Korea compared to western countries,” said Tae-Sung Yeum, attending psychiatrist at Gwanghwamun Forest Psychiatric Clinic. “There’s a high moral standard required, especially for female celebrities, because South Korea is a patriarchal society.”
Sulli, Goo’s long-time friend, also made headlines, often malicious and misogynistic, for speaking out about subjects such as ageism and feminism. She was criticized for wearing shirts without a bra, calling older male colleagues by their first names and openly supporting feminism.
Yeum said it’s difficult for K-pop stars to seek professional help for depression, especially in a country where many people believe that psychiatric disorders can be “treated with one’s will.” He said multiple suicides in the industry stem from stars being plunged into a hypercompetitive system with a plethora of abuses from a young age.
When Sulli was found dead in her Seongnam home, Goo bid farewell to her friend in a live-streamed video. “I will live more diligently for you,” Goo cried while apologizing for not being able to make it to her funeral.
Two days before Goo’s death, she uploaded a final selfie on her Instagram with the caption, “Good night.”

At the end of a year that saw musicians like Niall Horan and Ed Sheeran gingerly dip their toes into other languages, Coldplay have responded: Hold my European beer.
Their new album, “Everyday Life,” is so utterly embracing of the world that has words spoken or sung in Arabic, Spanish, Zulu and Igbo, and even a French verse sung by lead singer Chris Martin.
This cover image released by Parlophone/Atlantic shows “Everyday Life,” a release by Coldplay. Photo: Parlophone/Atlantic via AP
It’s a fluid and experimental 53-minute double album, divided into two halves, Sunrise and Sunset. If on 2015’s “A Head Full of Dreams,” the band sampled the likes of Barack Obama and a Rumi poem, now they’re doubling down.
“Everyday Life” is bursting with idiosyncratic references, ranging from the film “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” to a Bob Dylan lyric, a novel by Khaled Hosseini, audio of a bullying traffic stop by a cop in Philadelphia, an elegy to Africa, samples from Nigerian composer Harcourt Whyte and jazz legend Alice Coltrane, the South African activist song “Jikelele” and an exuberant tune about Syrian refugees (“Orphans,” which features a credit for Martin’s teenage son, Moses).
“Orphans” is really the only traditional-sounding Coldplay song. The others are often subdued, instrumental or undercooked. “I haven’t finished this one yet” say the liner notes on the stripped-down and fragmentary “WOTW/POTP.” It’s an astonishing, unsafe step from a band who could have just kept giving us “Something Like This.”
There are ambient sounds and snippets from films, including the documentaries “Everything Is Incredible” and “Fela Kuti: Music is the Weapon.” The band even seems to reference themselves (“Boom bo-boom boom” from “X Marks the Spot.”) Sometimes it feels less than an album and more like a multimedia project.
Fans will find that, sonically, the band has stepped off the dance floor. The new music is less bombastic and more intimate. “Old Friends” is a mournful ode to loss, while “Daddy” is sung from the heartbreaking perspective of an abandoned child. “Daddy are you OK?/Look dad we got the same hair.” There’s even spots of gospel and funk-jazz.
The band is also playing with time, with lyrics and credits seemingly created on an old typewriter and offering old timey band portraits that recall those famous shots of The Band.
There are also political songs — the menacing “Trouble in Town” and the sarcastic “Guns” — but most of the album is about faith — all faiths, from East Asian Buddhism to Pakistani Sufism.
It begins with a prayer in “Church” — “Oh, Father, God Almighty, why have you forsaken me?” — and ends 15 songs later with a soft thanksgiving Hallelujah, thanks to the gentle title track’s earnest plea for peace (sounding not unlike something from “Parachutes”)
“How in the world am I going to see/You as my brother not my enemy,” Martin sings. “Got to keep dancing when the lights go out.” In response to an ailing world, Coldplay are opening their arms wide and refusing to stop believing.

80,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/leonard-cohens-posthumous-album-centres-on-poetry/,"Leonard Cohen, “Thanks for the Dance” (Columbia/Legacy Recordings)
Leonard Cohen’s last album, released just weeks before he passed in 2016, was “You Want It Darker,” which had a sense of finality that made it a fine conclusion to his brilliant musical career.
“Thanks for the Dance,” on the other hand, seems to bring down the curtain on Cohen’s parallel universe, the poetry he started to publish long before he began making records.
Illustrating the point, the new nine-track set is more like a Cohen spoken-word performance with very good and empathetic musical backing, most of it composed by his son, Adam.
Understated exceptions are the title track and a few lines here and there, but Cohen doesn’t really sing, not that his resonant voice needs a melody to convey the experience, depth, humour, horror and beauty of his lyrics.
Expanding on recordings made mostly at the same time as the sessions for “You Want It Darker,” Adam Cohen and engineer/mixer Michael Chaves searched out some of the master’s previous collaborators and some new ones to complete the compositions. Among them are Sharon Robinson, Jennifer Warnes, the Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue Choir, Beck, Daniel Lanois, Feist, Javier Mas, Zac Rae, Patrick Leonard and Anjani Thomas.
“Happens to the Heart” opens the album with haunting guitar, laud and piano supporting Cohen’s listing of a life’s worth of experiences, the gentle accompaniment from Andre de Ridder’s stargaze orchestra making the lines even more effective — “I was always working steady/But I never called it art.”
The title track could be a sequel to “Take This Waltz,” a 1980s song with lyrics Cohen adapted from a poem by Federico García Lorca. Here the themes appear to be more personal but just as inspired.
Other highlights include the subtle flamenco airs of “The Night of Santiago,” the dark-as-night and terrifying “Puppets” and closer “Listen to the Hummingbird,” a short but wise and emotional epilogue.
“Thanks for the Dance” is like discovering a box of old letters — or in this case, poems — from a departed loved one. It’s an emotional experience that allows Cohen’s great talents to be appreciated again.

As many as 2,000 Nepalis from all backgrounds, irrespective of profession and ideology, came together to support and participate in Nepathya live concert in Brisbane.
The band started the show with their first recorded song ‘Aganai Bhari‘ and the audience went frenzy singing the songs with the band.
As the show went on, band’s lead singer Amrit Gurung performed their upcoming new song Naina Tala, a song sung by Nepali Gorkha army, who served during the British occupation of India. The song traversed through other British Gurkha regiments around the world and came to the Nepali settlement.

“I had been hearing this song since my childhood from the retired Gorkhali Lahure uncles,” Amrit Gurung shared explaining the roots of the song.
“We are glad to see people from all walks of life and age come together to celebrate Nepali music with us,” Gurung, band’s lead singer and social activist said.
The Brisbane show was organised by Mount 8848 Events and the Australia tour is coordinated by Sydney based Nepali Touch. After successfully performing in Brisbane, the band heads to Adelaide where they will rock the audience on November 22.

NEW YORK: Singer Ariana Grande is telling her fans that she has a bad sinus condition that has made her “very sick” and might force her to cancel upcoming shows on her world tour.
Grande, 26, says in videos posted Saturday on Instagram that “my throat and head are still in so much pain.”
While she sounds OK, “I’m just in a lot of pain and it’s difficult to breathe during the show,” she says in a message to her fans. “I just really don’t know what’s happening with my body right now and need to figure it out.”
Grande says she plans to see a doctor soon.
She adds: “I’m scared that I might have to cancel some things, so this is kind just a heads up of like I don’t know what’s happening with my body, and I’m really disappointed and freaked out of why I can’t get better because it’s been over three weeks at this point.”

84,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/joker-expected-to-cross-1-billion-global-box-office-milestone/,"Comic book movie “Joker” is poised to surpass $1 billion in global ticket sales on Friday, becoming the first R-rated Hollywood movie ever to overcome the milestone.
“Joker,” a dark origin story from Warner Bros about Batman’s arch nemesis, had sold $999.1 billion as of Thursday despite not having been screened in China, which is projected to become the world’s largest movie market next year.
Starring Joaquin Phoenix as a mentally-ill loner who finds fame through a random act of violence, the movie earned warm reviews as it opened in early October but stoked controversy in the United States over fears it would encourage violence.



Box office analyst Gitesh Pandya said “Joker” would top the $1 billion level on Friday.


“Absolutely jaw-dropping achievement for an R-rated film with a moderate budget and no China release,” Pandya, founder and editor of Box Office Guru, wrote on Twitter.
Its nearest R-rated rivals are 2018 movie “Deadpool 2” ($785 million) and 2016’s “Deadpool” ($783 million), both starring Ryan Reynolds as a foul-mouthed superhero.



Thanks to a modest production budget estimated at about $60 million, “Joker” is also the most profitable comic book movie ever, according to Forbes.com, due largely to the film’s focus on character rather than special effects and action scenes.



“Joker” is now the 7th biggest Hollywood movie at the 2019 box office, behind action-packed blockbuster “Avengers: Endgame” at $2.8 billion and family movie “The Lion King” at $1.6 billion, both from Walt Disney.
The movie is expected to land nominations in the upcoming Hollywood awards season and has inspired fans to visit the spot in New York’s Bronx district where Phoenix’s character transforms into the Joker, his face painted like a clown and with green hair, and dances triumphantly down a set of steep steps.

86,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/disney-plus-adds-disclaimer-about-racist-movie-stereotypes/,"NEW YORK: Disney’s new streaming service has added a disclaimer to “Dumbo,” “Peter Pan” and other classics because they depict racist stereotypes, underscoring a challenge media companies face when they resurrect older movies in modern times.
The move comes as Disney Plus seems to be an instant hit. It attracted 10 million subscribers in just one day. The disclaimer reads, “This program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.”
Companies have been grappling for years with how to address stereotypes that were in TV shows and movies decades ago but look jarring today. Streaming brings the problem to the fore.
In “Dumbo,” from 1941, crows that help Dumbo learn to fly are depicted with exaggerated black stereotypical voices. The lead crow’s name is “Jim Crow,” a term that describes a set of laws that legalized segregation. In “Peter Pan,” from 1953, Native American characters are caricatured. Other Disney movies with the disclaimer include “The Jungle Book” and “Swiss Family Robinson.”
“Pocahontas” and “Aladdin” do not have it, despite rumblings by some that those films contain stereotypes, too.
On personal computers, the disclaimer appears as part of the text description of shows and movies underneath the video player. It’s less prominent on a cellphone’s smaller screen. Viewers are instructed to tap on a “details” tab for an “advisory.”
Disney’s disclaimer echoes what other media companies have done in response to problematic videos, but many people are calling on Disney to do more.
The company “needs to follow through in making a more robust statement that this was wrong, and these depictions were wrong,” said Psyche Williams-Forson, chairwoman of American studies at the University of Maryland at College Park. “Yes, we’re at a different time, but we’re also not at a different time.”
She said it is important that the images are shown rather than deleted, because viewers should be encouraged to talk with their children and others about the videos and their part in our cultural history.
Disney’s disclaimer is a good way to begin discussion about the larger issue of racism that is embedded in our cultural history, said Gayle Wald, American studies chairwoman at George Washington University.
“Our cultural patrimony in the end is deeply tethered to our histories of racism, our histories of colonialism and our histories of sexism, so in that sense it helps to open up questions,” she said.
Wald said Disney is “the most culturally iconic and well-known purveyor of this sort of narrative and imagery,” but it’s by no means alone.
Universal Pictures’ teen comedy “Sixteen Candles” has long been decried for stereotyping Asians with its “Long Duk Dong” character.
Warner Bros. faced a similar problem with its “Tom and Jerry” cartoons that are available for streaming. Some of the cartoons now carry a disclaimer as well, but it goes further than Disney’s statement.
Rather than refer to vague “cultural depictions,” the Warner Bros. statement calls its own cartoons out for “ethnic and racial prejudices.”
“While these cartoons do not represent today’s society, they are being presented as they were originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed,” the statement reads.
At times, Disney has disavowed a movie entirely.
“Song of the South,” from 1946, which won an Oscar for the song “Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,” was never released for home video and hasn’t been shown theatrically for decades, due to its racist representation of the plantation worker Uncle Remus and other characters. It isn’t included in Disney Plus, either.
Disney and Warner Bros did not respond to requests for comment.
Sonny Skyhawk, an actor and producer who created the group American Indians in Film and Television, found the two-sentence disclaimer lacking.
What would serve minority groups better than any disclaimer is simply offering them opportunities to tell their own stories on a platform like Disney Plus, Skyhawk said. He said that when he talks to young Indian kids, “the biggest negative is they don’t see themselves represented in America.”

Colman, who won an Oscar earlier this year for playing a different royal in dark comedy “The Favourite,” portrays Queen Elizabeth in a retelling of the life of Britain’s reigning monarch. Colman replaces Claire Foy, who won a Golden Globe for the role as a younger version of Elizabeth.
The show’s third season, arriving on Netflix on Sunday, picks up the story in the mid-1960s going through to 1977, as heir to the throne Prince Charles (Josh O’Connor) comes of age and Britain goes through a pop culture revolution led by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.

Creator Peter Morgan has said the series, whose first two seasons cost about $130 million to make, is based on known facts and imagined private conversations.



Helena Bonham Carter, who takes on Elizabeth’s younger sister Princess Margaret, said she was a joy to play.



“The hardest thing about playing Margaret or anybody of the family is that ultimately so many people feel they know her. And everyone has an opinion,” Bonham Carter told Reuters Television on the red carpet.
“There were so many really close friends that were all too happy to talk about her and wanted to and really loved her and also wanted to show the side that was less known about her – that she was funny, that she was full of warmth and that she was very multicolored,” the actress said.
Erin Doherty, who plays second-born child Princess Anne, said that working on the series had made her more sympathetic to the royal family.


“After doing this show, I feel like I understand them a lot more and I really, really value them and I have a lot of empathy for them,” Doherty said.


Asked whether he thought the royal family watched the show, Tobias Menzies, who plays the queen’s husband Prince Philip in middle age, said he doubted it.
“It makes me a bit nervous imagining them watching it. I’d be amazed if they watch it, but maybe they do…. My money is that they probably don’t,” he said.

The Grammy-winning singer known for his silky-smooth vocals was revealed as this year’s winner Tuesday night on NBC’s “The Voice.” He serves as a coach on the singing competition series with Gwen Stefani, Kelly Clarkson and Blake Shelton.
Shelton, who was named Sexiest Man Alive in 2017, announced Legend’s honor on “The Voice.” The country singer then handed Legend some short shorts with bedazzled letters “EGOTSMA” to signify the singer’s many honors: an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony and now, Sexiest Man Alive.
Legend tells the magazine in an issue out Friday the honor comes with some pressure after following Idris Elba, who was last year’s winner. He jokes it “is not fair and is not nice to me!”
The 40-year-old Legend is a 10-time Grammy winner.

89,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/war-epic-midway-bests-doctor-sleep-at-the-box-office/,"LOS ANGELES: Despite a fresh injection of four big movies into the marketplace including a Stephen King adaptation, a World War II epic, a glossy, holiday-themed romantic comedy and a family-friendly comedy, audiences largely stayed away from theatres this weekend and the North American box office is hurting.
Down nearly 27% from last year, the sluggish weekend allowed for a few big surprises, however. The biggest surprise was the fact that the Roland Emmerich film “Midway,” which slightly overperformed, snagged the first-place spot over Warner Bros.’ “Doctor Sleep,” a film that came in well under expectations and has left many in the business scratching their heads as to why.

Lionsgate on Sunday estimated that “Midway” earned $17.5 million from 3,242 screens. The studio acquired the film about the Battle of Midway that features a large ensemble cast including Nick Jonas and Patrick Wilson.
“As expected, everyone is ecstatic,” said David Spitz, Lionsgate’s president of domestic distribution.
“Midway” cost a reported $100 million to produce and the studio is projecting that the film will have grossed $20.1 million by the end of Veteran’s Day Monday.
Reviews didn’t seem to play into account with the box office at all this weekend. Critics were not kind to “Midway” (it’s currently at 40% on Rotten Tomatoes), but audiences, who were largely male (60 and older (87% were over 25) had given the film an A CinemaScore.
And although $17.5 million is not a massive number on its own, it was a significant upset since going into the weekend experts thought the No. 1 spot would easily go to Warner Bros.’ “Doctor Sleep,” the high-profile Stephen King adaptation starring Ewan McGregor. But audiences slept on the well-reviewed (73% on Rotten Tomatoes) sequel to King’s “The Shining” and it grossed only $14.1 million from over 3,800 locations. The film from director Mike Flanagan even utilized the classic imagery of Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film version of “The Shining,” which factored heavily into the marketing.
Budgeted at around $50 million, “Doctor Sleep” was expected to open to over $25 million. The studio was disappointed with the result. But it’s at least partially attributable to the “general malaise” at the box office this weekend.
“There’s no way to sugarcoat this, this was a pretty awful weekend for the overall marketplace,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for the box office tracker Comscore.
In a more minor surprise, Paramount Pictures’ John Cena-led “Playing With Fire,” a family-friendly comedy about firefighters, opened in third place with $12.8 million over Universal Pictures’ Wham!-inspired romantic comedy “Last Christmas.” Starring Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, “Last Christmas” took fourth place with $11.6 million. But Universal is optimistic about its prospects, considering the thematic nature of the film and the holiday weekends to come.
“We have a fantastic storyteller in Paul Feig and a ridiculously charming cast,” said Universal’s distribution head Jim Orr.
Once again, the bright spots at the box office are in the awards-friendly limited releases. Amazon opened Shia LaBeouf’s autobiographical film “Honey Boy” in four locations, where it earned a strong $288,824. And Lauren Greenfield’s Imelda Marcos documentary “The Kingmaker” opened in two locations to $23,600. Both “Parasite,” which earned $2.6 million from 603 locations, and “Jojo Rabbit,” which added $3.9 million from 802 locations, also continue to perform well as the films expand a little bit each week.
But it’s still one of the worst early November weekends in years and Dergarabedian noted that the smaller films are not going to move the needle on the overall box office for the year, which remains down 5.5%.
“It’s definitely a little bit of a challenged box office,” Orr said.
Although The Walt Disney Co.’s “Frozen 2” is on the horizon to help pick things up, Dergarabedian said that at this point, 2019 might not best the record 2018 box office year.
“I think it’d be really tough at this point (to surpass 2018). But it’s not a ‘Chicken Little’ situation,” Dergarabedian said. “When we compare to any other year it’s a solid year.”
Still, he added, “For November, this is a very slow weekend.”

Allen had sued two Amazon units in February, claiming they could not abandon their distribution plans, including for his completed “A Rainy Day in New York,” because of a “baseless” allegation that he had molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992.
Amazon countered in court papers that Allen’s comments related to the #MeToo movement, which began in late 2017, ensured that the company could never receive the expected benefits from its contract with Allen, justifying its decision to end their relationship.
The filmmaker has long denied the allegation by Dylan Farrow, which was also made by her mother Mia Farrow, who appeared in a dozen Allen films and was his longtime partner. He has not been charged.
Allen has won four Oscars, including best director for 1977’s “Annie Hall,” which also won the best picture.
But he has seen modest commercial returns for many films since breaking up with Mia Farrow, and some actors and actresses have expressed regret for appearing in his films after Dylan Farrow’s allegation gained renewed attention.
“Rainy Day” has been released outside the United States but not domestically.

91,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/netflix-serves-up-green-eggs-and-ham-with-all-star-cast/,"LOS ANGELES: When screenwriter Jared Stern was approached about developing Dr Seuss’ “Green Eggs and Ham” as an animated series, he sought advice from one important woman and the consent of another.
“I mentioned it to my grandmother and she said, ‘That was your favourite book when you were little. You used to read it to me all the time,'” Stern fondly recalled. “I basically learned to read reading this book.”

But he needed more than grandmom behind him. The project required approval from the widow of Theodor Geisel, the singular writer known as Dr Seuss. So Stern and fellow executive producer Jeff Kleeman made a pilgrimage to her San Diego-area home about five years ago. Audrey Geisel died last year; her husband died in 1991.
“I had to pitch the story to her and it was incredibly scary,” said Stern. “Once it was over, she said something to the effect of, ‘I wondered what you were going to do with this. But I think you really captured it, and you have our blessing.'”
The result is a 13-episode series debuting Friday on Netflix with a voice cast that includes Michael Douglas as the character who turns up his nose at green eggs and ham and Adam Devine as Sam-I-am, the dish’s cheerleader. Other big-name actors along for the ride include Diane Keaton, Eddie Izzard, Tracy Morgan, John Turturro and Jeffrey Wright. (“Having Ellen DeGeneres as an executive producer certainly helps,” Stern said.)
Stern understood Audrey Geisel’s initial doubts since he shared them when the project was proposed by Kleeman, president of DeGeneres’ production company. Stern’s first reaction: Why mess with perfection? Then he gave the 1960 book another look.
“I started flipping through it and realized, ‘Oh, it’s an odd couple.’ There’s the grumpy guy who’s closed off to things and a playful guy who’s open to things. And not only that, it’s a road trip because he won’t eat the eggs in a car, on a train, on a boat — here, there and everywhere,” he said, allowing the original story to be opened up while staying true to its message and spirit.
Devine, of the “Pitch Perfect” movies and TV’s “The Righteous Gemstones” and “Modern Family,” said he focused on bringing “manic little kid enthusiasm” to Sam-I-Am.
“I’m basically doing an impression of myself opening Christmas presents…. just how excited you would get when you’re a kid, and you want to explain all your toys and explain how you’re going to play with them,” Devine said.
The series lets him play with his lines. “The dialogue is just so fun. When you actually get through a chunk where you’re doing a lot of Seussian-type dialogue, you feel so good about yourself.”
Stern, whose big-screen animation writing credits include “The Lego Batman Movie” and “Wreck-It Ralph,” has a close familiarity with the various styles of animation, including the now-common CGI. But the majority of the characters and backgrounds in “Green Eggs and Ham” are traditional 2-D hand-drawn animation, which evokes Seuss’ charming storybook illustrations and involved 300 artists over the course of four years of production.
That severely tested her patience, joked DeGeneres. But the result is something parents who remember the book warmly can watch with their kids, she said, and without having their own limits pushed.
“It’s great for kids and it’s great for parents to have on without being annoyed. It’s not going to be somebody singing, ‘Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo,'” she said reciting the omnipresent video ditty. “That could drive parents crazy.”

92,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/goodness-and-humor-celebrated-as-sesame-street-turns-50/,"NEW YORK: Fifty years ago, beloved entertainer Carol Burnett appeared on the very first broadcast of a quirky TV program that featured a bunch of furry puppets.
Blink and you might miss it, but Burnett followed a cartoon about a witch called Wanda, which was loaded with words beginning with the letter w.
“Wow, Wanda the Witch is weird,” Burnett commented. And then — poof — she was gone.
This image released by HBO shows the cast of “Sesame Street” during a celebration of their 50th season of the popular children’s TV show. This first episode of “Sesame Street” aired in the fall of 1969. Photo: AP
That show was “Sesame Street” and Burnett, like a lot of kids, was instantly hooked. She would return to the show multiple times, including visits to demonstrate to pre-school viewers where her nose was and to smooch a rubber duckie.
“I was a big fan. I would have done anything they wanted me to do,” she said. “I loved being exposed to all that goodness and humor.”
This first episode of “Sesame Street” — sponsored by the letters W, S and E and the numbers 2 and 3 — aired in the fall of 1969. It was a turbulent time in America, rocked by the Vietnam War and raw from the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King the year before. The media, like today, was going through disruption.
Newt Minow, who was the Federal Communications Commission chairman at the time, famously said TV was becoming “a vast wasteland.” Like today, there was lots of content, but it wasn’t necessarily quality.


Enter “Sesame Street” creators Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett, who worked with Harvard University developmental psychologist Gerald Lesser to build the show’s unique approach to teaching that now reaches 120 million children. Legendary puppeteer Jim Henson supplied the critters.


“It wasn’t about if kids were learning from TV, it was about what they were learning from TV,” said Steve Youngwood, the chief operating officer of Sesame Workshop. “If they could harness that power to teach them the alphabet and their numbers as opposed to the words to beer commercials, you may be able to make a really big difference.”
No one else was doing it. Children’s programing at the time was made up of shows like “Captain Kangaroo,” ″Romper Room” and the violent skirmishes between “Tom & Jerry.” ″Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood” was lovely, but it was mostly teaching social skills.
“There was nothing even remotely that contained any educational component at all for children,” said Phillip Levine, a professor of economics at Wellesley College who has studied the show. ”‘Sesame Street’ was 100% about education.”
The show was designed by education professionals and child psychologists with one goal: to help low-income and minority students aged 2-5 overcome some of the deficiencies they had when entering school. Social scientists had long noted white and higher income kids were often better prepared.
So, it wasn’t an accident that the show was set on an urban street with a multicultural cast. Diversity and inclusion were baked into the show. Monsters, humans and animals all lived together peacefully.
Bert, Ernie and the gang made an instant impression on actress Sonia Manzano. She saw a neighborhood that looked like hers. She saw people who looked like her. She would become a cast member, Maria, on the show, starring and writing for it from 1971-2015, including getting married on air.
“I was raised without seeing people of color on television. So, when I was given the opportunity to be a person of color on television, I jumped at it,” said Manzano, who is of Latino descent. “And I think I was successful as Maria because I never forgot that there could be a little kid like me watching television and forming ideas about the world.”
Over the years, “Sesame Street” has welcomed many more. It became the first children’s program to feature someone with Down syndrome. It’s had puppets with HIV and in foster care, invited children in wheelchairs, dealt with topics like jailed parents, homelessness, women’s rights, military families and even girls singing about loving their hair.
It introduced the bilingual Rosita — the first Latina Muppet — in 1991. Julia, a 4-year-old Muppet with autism came in 2017 and this year has offered help for kids whose parents are dealing with addiction and recovery. So important is the show that PETA recently asked for the creation of a vegan Muppet.
“We are a mirror to society here even though we’re dealing with birds and chickens and monsters,” said Matt Vogel, the puppeteer who portrays Big Bird and the Count and who grew up watching “Sesame Street.”
When actor Will Lee, who played the grocer Mr. Hooper, died in 1982, the show explained death to children. When Big Bird lost his nest to a hurricane, the community rebuilt his home. To help kids after 9/11, Elmo was left traumatized by a fire at Hooper’s store but was soothingly told that firefighters were there to help.
“We see a need and we meet that need because I feel like we have a voice that’s loud enough that can do that — that can reach people and make a difference,” Vogel said. “Our mission is to make kids smarter, stronger and kinder and that those lessons that we impart to them stay with them.”
Therapist Jerry Moe, the national director of the Hazelden Betty Ford Children’s Program , applauds the show for helping children handle trauma — addiction, PTSD, death.
“While the numbers and the colors and the sizes and the shapes are all incredibly important, so is that social-emotional development that children need,” he said.
″‘Sesame Street’ deals with the reality of what’s going on with the kids today. And ‘Sesame Street’ does it in such a child-friendly, age-appropriate, developmentally-appropriate way that not only grabs kids’ attention, but also all the providers,” Moe said.
Celebrity appearances — starting with Burnett and now numbering 650 — aren’t just a fun component of the show, they’re part of the lesson. From Janelle Monae to Sarah Jessica Parker, from Anderson Cooper to Danny DeVito — they’re all part of an attempt to lure parents to watch as well.
“When parents watch the show with their kids, the learning is deeper because you have a conversation about what you watched together. You talk about it,” said Benjamin Lehmann, executive producer. “The parents are there to scaffold on the lessons.”
In the adults’ honor are characters who go over the heads of young viewers — Ethel Mermaid, Baa Baa Walters and Alistair Cookie — not to mention spoofs like “Orange Is the New Snack,” ″Grouch Eye for the Nice Guy” and “Upside Downton Abbey.”
Not everyone has adored the show, especially those who grouse about federal funds going to a nonprofit that earns millions on licensing for everything from lunch boxes and toys to diapers and commercials for Farmers Insurance.
Big Bird in 2012 found himself unexpectedly in the presidential race when Mitt Romney said he would defund public broadcasting if elected. “I love Big Bird,” then-President Barack Obama retorted. (On “Saturday Night Live,” Big Bird insisted he didn’t want to “ruffle any feathers.”)
In 2015, the longtime PBS show inked a five-year pact with HBO that gave the premium cable channel the right to air new episodes nine months before they air on PBS. That prompted some criticism that Sesame Workshop favored viewers who could afford HBO over those who could not. But since the HBO deal, the show has not gotten any federal funding.
Before each season, educators and creators gather to align the curriculum with the latest thinking. In the past, for example, narrative stories were broken up into little chunks because the thinking at the time was that kids couldn’t follow a long story. That turns out not to be true, and “Sesame Street” now delivers 10-minute narratives.
Sesame Workshop has also pared episodes from an hour to 30 minutes, and the show is now shot on 4K, with the creators knowing that most children are watching on tablets or phones.
Does it all really help? In 2016, Levine and economist Melissa Kearney at the University of Maryland produced one of the most widely cited studies about the impact of “Sesame Street.”
They compared households that got the show with those who didn’t and found that the children exposed to “Sesame Street” were 14% more likely to be enrolled in the correct grade level for their age at middle and high school.
“There’s no question that the introduction of ‘Sesame Street’ was a good thing,” Levine said. “Early childhood intervention does have the ability to improve lifelong learning among children.”
Some shows have lasted longer — “Meet the Press” and “The Tonight Show” among them — but few have had as big a cultural impact. “Sesame Street” is shown in more than 150 countries, has won 193 Emmys, 10 Grammys and will get a 2019 Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement in December, the first time a television program will receive the award.
Music has always been a big part of the show and its song “Rubber Duckie” peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard charts in 1970. “Sing,” which premiered on the show, went even higher, hitting No. 3 on Billboard in 1973 when the Carpenters recorded it.
There have been a few bumps in the road, like Roosevelt Franklin, an early puppet whose stereotypical African American dialect offended many. Katy Perry showed a little too much Katy Perry for some parents in 2010 and Cookie Monster, in the face of an obesity epidemic, had to moderate his adoration of cookies to “a sometimes food.”
But the show is still going strong despite an explosion of cheap online alternatives with bright colors and songs — like “Baby Shark” — all competing for preschoolers’ eyeballs. One recent study found kids as young as 2 had a daily screen time diet of 3 hours.
“There’s a different version of a wasteland right now. And in some ways that motivates us even more to make sure that we, and the industry at large, doesn’t give into that,” Youngwood said. “We have to earn their time every day as opposed to the view that it’s an entitlement.”

93,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/seoul-police-investigating-bts-member-over-traffic-accident/,"SEOUL: Police said Monday they’re investigating a member of K-pop superstar group BTS over a traffic accident that left him and a taxi driver with minor injuries.
BTS’ agency, Big Hit Entertainment, said 22-year-old Jungkook admitted that he caused the accident by violating traffic laws and reached a settlement with the driver. The agency said the singer and driver both avoided serious injury.
“We apologise again to the victim and also to fans for causing concern,” the agency said in an emailed statement.
Seoul police said Jungkook was booked and an investigation of his case was underway in line with traffic law.
A police officer in charge of traffic accidents in Seoul described the case as minor because the incident did not cause much human or property damage. The officer, who requested anonymity because the investigation was underway, also said the case didn’t involve drunken driving or any other serious offences.
South Korean media reported earlier Monday that Jungkook and the taxi driver suffered bruises in the Saturday crash. The Segye Ilbo newspaper, citing police, said Jungkook violated unspecified traffic rules while driving his Mercedes Benz and hit the taxi on a Seoul street. Yonhap news agency cited police as saying that they plan to summon Jungkook soon.
BTS has a large international following and was the first K-pop act to debut atop the Billboard Album chart last year with “Love Yourself: Tear.”

94,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/terminator-dark-fate-is-no-1-but-its-no-winner/,"LOS ANGELES: It might be judgment day for the Terminator franchise.
Despite generally favourable reviews and the return of star Linda Hamilton and producer James Cameron, “Terminator: Dark Fate” has opened well below expectations at the box office. Studios on Sunday estimate that “Dark Fate” earned only $29 million from over 4,000 North American locations. The film from Paramount Pictures cost a reported $185 million to produce.

It was enough to win the top spot at the box office, but it’s a weak victory for the franchise. Although “Dark Fate,” which was directed by “Deadpool’s” Tim Miller, received much better reviews (currently at 69% on Rotten Tomatoes) and was praised for being a return to form to Cameron’s original films, it opened just slightly ahead of 2015’s roundly derided “Terminator: Genisys.”
“These big brands carry with them huge expectations, often unrealistic expectations,” said Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. “It wasn’t for lack of enthusiasm for the stars and filmmakers.”
Internationally, “Dark Fate” did much better, earning $72.9 million from 48 markets. Fox International, not Paramount, is handling international distribution, excluding China.
Second place went to “Joker,” which added $13.9 million, bringing its global earnings to $934 million in just five weeks in theatres. “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” landed in third place in its third weekend with an additional $12.2 million. The Angelina Jolie-led sequel has grossed $84.3 million in North America.
One bright spot of the weekend, which is down nearly 19% from last year when “Bohemian Rhapsody” opened, is Focus Features’ “Harriet,” which is the first film ever made about Harriet Tubman. Starring Cynthia Erivo in the title role, “Harriet” performed better than expected, earning $12 million from just over 2,000 theatres to take fourth place. The film scored a coveted A+ CinemaScore from audiences, who were primarily female (62 and over the age of 35 (59%). African Americans also made up a significant portion of the audience (49%) according to exit polls.
“It’s really heartwarming and gives you a lot of faith that there are still a lot of people who want to see stories about real-life superheroes,” said Focus Features distribution president Lisa Bunnell. “There’s a real feeling of love for this movie. I think it’s inspirational for people to see.”
Focus did outreach to faith-based groups and educators and has seen enormous success with group sales as a result.
Other newcomers struggled to find that kind of enthusiasm this weekend. Edward Norton’s adaptation of Jonathan Lethem’s “Motherless Brooklyn” opened in ninth place to $3.7 million, while the animated “Arctic Dogs” took 10th with $3.1 million.
One of the highest-profile new films of the weekend, Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman,” does not have any box office numbers to report, however, because Netflix declines to provide numbers for its theatrical releases. Starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, the film which opened in limited release before hitting Netflix on Nov 27 are expected to be a major Oscars contender.
“With all eyes on ‘The Irishman,’ it’s unfortunate that we don’t have numbers on it,” Dergarabedian said.
It’s especially true considering that other smaller release films with awards buzz continue to perform well. “Parasite” took in 2.6 million in its fifth weekend “Jojo Rabbit,” in its third weekend, added $2.4 million from 256 screens and “The Lighthouse,” also in weekend three, grossed $2 million from 978 locations.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at US and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.
1.”Terminator: Dark Fate,” $29 million ($72.9 million international).
2.”Joker,” $13.9 million ($37 million international).

8.”Black and Blue,” $4.1 million.

The cable channel said Tuesday that it’s given a 10-episode order to “House of the Dragon,” set 300 years before the original series that ended its eight-season run in May.
The prequel is based on George RR Martin’s “Fire & Blood,” HBO said. The new drama was co-created by Martin and Ryan Condal, whose credits include “Colony.”
It will focus on House Targaryen, made famous in “Game of Thrones” by Emilia Clarke’s Daenerys and her fearsome dragons.

“House of the Dragon” was announced by HBO programming president Casey Bloys during a presentation for HBO Max, the streaming service launching in May 2020. A spinoff of HBO megahit “Game of Thrones” would be a key attraction in the increasingly crowded streaming marketplace.
HBO declined comment on reports Tuesday that it had dropped another “Game of Thrones” prequel set thousands of years before the original. A pilot episode starring Watts had been filmed in Northern Ireland.
The straight-to-series order for “House of the Dragon,” whether a sign of faith in the project or pressure to get it into production, avoids letting devotees of the fantasy saga down once more.

NEW YORK: Stocks ended slightly higher on Friday, helped by better-than-expected quarterly results from Google’s parent Alphabet and retailer Amazon and a modest recovery in oil prices.
However, the gains were held back by disappointing results from Exxon Mobil as well as news out of the Bank of Japan, which did not announce as much stimulus as many had hoped.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 24.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,432.24.
The Dow was held back partly by a drop in the oil giant Exxon Mobil. The company reported its smallest quarterly profit in 17 years, well below what analysts were looking for, due to the continuing weakness in oil prices. Its major competitor, Chevron, fared slightly better. While earnings dropped sharply from a year ago, Chevron’s results still beat analysts’ expectations.
Exxon fell $1.25, or 1.4 percent, to $88.95. Chevron climbed 69 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $102.48 after being down earlier in the day.
Broader market indicators ended higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,173.60 and the Nasdaq composite increased 7.15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,162.13.
Wall Street is finishing out its busiest week of corporate earnings, which was dominated by mostly strong results from technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and others.
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped $25.50, or 3.3 percent, to $791.34. The company reported earnings of $8.42 a share, well above the $8.04 that analysts were looking for.
Amazon rose $6.20, or 1 percent, to $758.81. The online retail giant reported a profit of $1.78 per share, well above the $1.11 a share that analysts expected. Amazon reported it sold $30.4 billion in goods in the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier.
The strong results from Amazon and Google, as well as the results from other tech companies, helped lift the technology-heavy Nasdaq 1.2 percent this week, while the Dow lost 0.8 percent. The S&P 500 closed the week down slightly. It was the first weekly loss for the S&P 500 after four weeks of gains.
So far, corporate profits appear to be coming well ahead of what were very low expectations. Earnings in the S&P 500 so far are down 2.4 percent from a year ago, which is better than the 5.2 percent decline expected when earnings season started, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“Expectations were exceptionally low for the second quarter. While consumers goods and technology has been better than expected, the energy sector continues to show challenges,” said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock.
Investors remain cautious, however. The run-up earlier this month made stocks more expensive than investors are historically comfortable with. The S&P 500 is trading at 18.5 times its expected earnings for the next year, noticeable above the 12-14 times investors typically look for.
The presidential election will continue to grow as an issue for markets in the next several months. Investors dislike uncertainty, and the unexpectedly close presidential election and mostly unknown policies of Donald Trump puts them on edge.
Next week another fifth of the S&P 500 will report their results, including Proctor & Gamble, General Motors, Kraft Heinz, 21st Century Fox and Allstate, among many others.
Moore also pointed out the July jobs report, released August 5, will give investors direction since the June and May jobs reports showed two clashing directions for the US economy.
Japan’s central bank ended a policy meeting Friday by announcing it will expand purchases of exchange traded funds from financial institutions to help inject more cash into the world’s third-largest economy and pursue its 2 percent inflation target. But the measures fell short of hopes for more aggressive action. That helped the yen surge as investors priced in fewer yen in circulation. The dollar dropped to 102.03 yen from 105.45 yen.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury note falling to 1.46 percent from 1.51 percent the day before.
In energy trading, benchmark US crude reversed earlier losses and was up 46 cents to close at $41.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 24 cents to $42.46 a barrel in London.
Heating oil rose less than 1 cent to $1.28 a gallon, wholesale gasoline futures rose 1 cent to $1.32 a gallon and natural gas fell was little changed at $2.88 per thousand cubic feet.
In other currencies, the euro rose to $1.1179 from $1.1073 the day before and the British pound rose to $1.3239 from $1.3148.
The price of gold closed up $16.70 to $1,349 an ounce, silver rose 16 cents to $20.31 an ounce and copper rose a penny to $2.222 a pound.

NEW YORK: Five years after United Airlines and Continental merged, the company’s new CEO declared in a public letter that the combined company has failed to live up to the expectations of both fliers and United’s employees.
Just three weeks into the job, CEO Oscar Munoz acknowledged in full-page newspaper ads that “the journey hasn’t always been smooth.”
Since the merger, United has been plagued with chronic delays, computer outages and dissatisfied workers, who have a reputation for taking out their frustrations on fliers. The problems overshadowed the tenure of former CEO Jeff Smisek, who took over the combined airline when the merger closed on Oct. 1, 2009.
On Sept. 8, Chicago-based United Continental Holdings said Smisek was ousted following an internal investigation into the airline’s dealing with the public agency that operates its hub airport in Newark, New Jersey. That agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is part of a federal investigation into abuse of power. Munoz, a railroad executive and head of United’s audit committee, was named president and CEO.
In his letter, which ran in national newspapers, Munoz didn’t offer any hints as to how he will actually fix United’s many problems except that he will listen to fliers and employees.
“We are committed to re-earning your trust,” he wrote.
The company set up a website, UnitedAirtime.com, for people to ask questions and provide feedback to the airline. The airline posted a few questions and answers in advance of the site’s launch that focus on delayed luggage delivery, aging airplanes that lack Wi-Fi or working TVs and the poor quality of first-class meals.
“Let’s be honest, the implementation of the United and Continental merger has been rocky for customers and employees,” Munoz says on a video greeting on the site. “While it’s been improving recently, we still haven’t lived up to our promise or our potential.”

WASHINGTON: US manufacturers expanded at their slowest pace in two years last month, held back by faltering global growth and cutbacks in oil and gas drilling.
The Institute for Supply Management says its index of factory activity fell sharply to 50.2 in September from 51.1 in August. That is the lowest level since May 2013. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders and production both fell sharply and a measure of hiring also declined, according to the ISM, a trade group of purchasing managers. All three still barely remained in expansion territory.
US manufacturers are getting hit by slower growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy, and a stronger dollar, which makes US goods more expensive overseas. Oil and gas drillers are also cutting back on their orders for steel pipe and other goods in the wake of sharply lower oil prices.
China’s factory activity contracted last month, according to a survey of its purchasing managers, though its manufacturing index inched up to 49.8 from 49.7 in August.
Manufacturers cut 15,000 jobs last month, the most in five years, payroll services provider ADP said Wednesday. The government will release its jobs report Friday, and economists forecast it will show that the economy added 206,000 jobs overall.
The unemployment rate is expected to remain at a seven-year low of 5.1 percent.
Most economists expect US manufacturing will do little for the economy for the rest of the year, with the possible exception of automakers. But so far, healthy consumer spending on cars, homes and restaurant meals is offsetting overseas weakness and driving modest growth.

Are we utilising resources to the best of our ability?
As Shahrukh Khan stated in the blockbuster film, ‘Chennai Express’ — “Don’t underestimate the power of a common man”, the financial markets can deliver the same phrase with a twist. Don’t underestimate the power of information! In the age of technology and information, the world of traders has been enveloped by numerous data and reports. Life, as the traders know it, has been surrounded by scores of data emancipating from various economies and every second matters in the race towards accomplishing profits. With the passage of time, global markets have provided innovative ways to look at the markets and the fundamentals within it. Given that global markets are operating 24 hours a day and five days a week, inevitably investors will enhance their knowledge levels.
In recent times, during market operation, information does stem out from every corner of the globe with astounding pace that traders need to keep an eye on every major economy around the globe. Given the markets is a convergent point for the constant flow of information, investors should weigh the data and incorporate the ones which one feels will be imperative to his trading strategies. Easier said than done, the preceding sentence might leave some readers with a raised eyebrow and an immediate question — how do I weigh the information or how can I know the importance of such information?
In the first few trades, it is important to follow the impact of such information and wait to enact on the appropriate trade. With experience, the trader will learn the importance of such information and incorporate similar strategies in the ensuing days too.
But given the importance of the word ‘information’, are we utilising resources to the best of our abilities? Having undertaken numerous training classes related to the markets, I have noticed that participants have not been keeping themselves updated with the latest developments from around the globe. It is next to impossible to throw the dart expecting to find the bull’s eye when darkness has clouded the room. However, with light, the task of finding the bull’s eye becomes a tad easier. Information is the light, guiding traders and making the process of trading more effective.
A mentor once said — “information from the markets, if interpreted and processed in the right manner, will always reap greater results in the forthcoming days.” In contemporary times, processing the given information is a major challenge for the prevailing investors. In theory, trading seems easier but when theory has to be converted into practice, life does not seem to be easy. However, with experience and practice, one will surely master the art of trading from the given processed information. Hence, information is the most important commodity in today’s global financial world.

FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

Two is always better than one. When it comes to making a powerful impact, one needs to learn to effectively coordinate and collaborate. In every session, our aspiring change makers meet and learn from like-minded individuals and get exposed to new avenues to foster collaboration, expand their ideas, and maximise their efforts. Currently, our participants are working with various organisations and communities to implement their ideas and reach out to the right people with the right solutions and right attitude.

Martina Gautam
Morning shows the day. Youngest amongst the 13 girls, Martina Gautam believes in giving her best in whatever she does. A recent high school graduate, she wants to pursue Biomedical engineering in her undergraduate studies. Head strong about her goals, she leaves no opportunities behind to achieve them.
When EmpowHER came around, she knew what she needed to do. The idea of sharing the same platform with other like-minded women and learning new things excited her. She joined EmpowHER with a hope to improve her leadership skills, and bring back her experience and understandings to her students.
She has been working as a teacher since the last three years at a women’s school in her neighbourhood. Many of her students work as domestic helpers in dif ferent houses in the community. In exchange for school fees, many young women from rural Nepal travel to the capital to work as domestic helpers. Despite mistreatment and abuse, these girls stay with their host families so that they can receive free schooling. But most of them do not even get to go to school, and even if they do they cannot concentrate and lag behind in their classes due to over workload. Therefore, through her EmpowHER ‘Impact Service Project’ Martina will provide free coaching classes to help these girls with their assignments and class works including sessions on ESL, mathematics, and computer courses. Based on their performance in the coaching classes, she will provide
scholarships to few students to support their tuition fees. She hopes her effort will
help at least few young women to pursue education without being forced into domestic labour.
For her, EmpowHER has exceeded her expectation. It has offered more than she had anticipated, helping her gain more clarity about her goals and herself.
Change maker #10:
Nisha Bhatt
Reap what you sow. Nisha Bhatt who is a second year Bachelor’s student of Social Science knows that to get good results you need to put in good effort. Passionate about
social change, she believes that a society can only be progressive when women are
given their basic rights without hesitance.
Through her ‘Impact Service Project’, she wants to create awareness about “Chaupadi”, an old tradition that banishes women during their menstruation forcing them to live in a sheds or outbuildings. They have limited food, poor sanitation, and are vulnerable to wild animal attacks and sexual harassments. Despite being
outlawed in 2005, many families in Western Nepal still practice this detrimental and life threatening tradition. She wants to pilot her project in Mashfal VDC in Dolpa, where many women have lost their lives to Chaupadi. With the help of her project, she will be providing awareness trainings in the community to help women overcome the social pressure to practice such traditions, and establish an understanding of menstruation as a biological process rather than a regressive social practice. She will also provide trainings on women health and how women can take care of themselves while they are menstruating. She hopes that her efforts will help the community gain a different perspective on women menstruation, leading to both behavioral and social change towards such practices.
She joined EmpowHER to empower herself so that she can enable other women in the community. Through EmpowHER she has been able to strengthen her interpersonal skills, better herself as a leader, and develop ever lasting sisterhood.
As the journey of EmpowHER progresses, we see the passion, focus, and the sense of responsibility towards the community brewing strongly in our participants. We are confident that these change makers will leave no stones unturned to make a powerful impact anywhere they go.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

105,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

106,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

107,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/trade-with-confidence/,"IT IS SEEN THAT TRADERS FOCUS ON RESULTS RATHER THAN PROCESS

KATHMANDU: Trade outcomes cannot be assured. The market might be predicted up to some level but its result is uncertain. You entered a market with full preparation to come out successful and it happened to be same as predicted but it can be the other way too; you entered a market with full study and analysis and relied on probabilities to come out successful but it had an unexpected outcome. The nature of trading is like that. Due to its nature and effect on the psyche of human being, it is essential to have a lot of self-confidence.
Self-confidence is an element which is required in every field to excel. Without this underlying competence, a person cannot grow and be ahead. It is rightly said that ‘Without confidence, we can do little in life. With it, we can change the world’. Confidence is a tool which when used in trading can have a positive impact and help to improve the performance thereon. Self-confidence in trading is the ability to focus on improvement and better performance thereby keeping self away from negative thought patterns like fear, greed, anxiety, et cetera.

Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade

Many traders have the misconception that winning trades develop confidence but the fact is just the opposite. More winning trades come from a dedicated focus on the process of trading where traders develop their skills and in doing so, develop their confidence. Focus on the process of trading is very important but very often, it is seen that traders focus on results rather than process. Soon if a trader sees a loss or two in a strategy they attempted, they will discard the strategy. This attitude leads only to frustration. So, in the phase of trading it is quite important to understand how we learn. Learning does not start at point A and steadily progress to point B; it is not a linear. Learning occurs in a series of ups and downs. We grow a little, fall back a bit, advance some more, take breaks and this is how it goes.
Other thing which leads to confidence development is positive thoughts. Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade. They don’t have a negative outlook. Rather they are quite optimistic and try to learn from their mistakes. It is said that positive outlook brings out positive result and the same applies to trading too. So instead of burdenning your mind with negative thoughts and wasting your time, be positive and think of how you can plan your trade better and follow it properly.
Develop self-confidence and you will see a better performance in your trade!

108,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/entrepreneur-juggler/,"“START SMALL, REALLY SMALL. TEST YOUR BUSINESS MODEL BEFORE YOU REACH OUT TO THE MASS.”

KATHMANDU: Amun Thapa, 27, owner/co-owner of five companies combined suggests that he is an ‘entrepreneur juggler’. When asked what it means, he states, “Someone who is constantly juggling between several ventures. At present, I manage Sasto Deal, Sasto Book, Irish Pub, Chhahari Production and Anthropose. A few other interesting projects are in the pipeline.”
Before asking him how he manages to look after all of these, I was curious to know where he started. Amun, I discovered, sees things in black and white without much grey areas. “For any problem, there are two approaches — to complain or to seek for solutions. I have always taken the latter approach. I never intended to become an entrepreneur. But the problems I personally faced in Nepal and elsewhere got me to come up with solutions, and hence the businesses I am involved with,” he shares. He says that getting where he is today was not an easy task. In his own words, “The first and foremost hurdle, when starting a business, is to understand the local legal and tax systems. Nepali entrepreneurs still do not have a clear understanding of how they should go about when it comes to taxation. It is a shame but also a reality that most businesses operate without proper registration and billings. This makes it difficult for other businesses to work. Also, finding the right employees is another major challenge here, apart from building culture.”
Amun shares that getting investment for a start-up in Nepal was a daunting task. He blames the regulations set by the Central Bank for Foreign Direct Investment and suggests that the easiest route is to seek for investment among friends and family. With profit margins depending on the venture/start-up, Amun says that the first year of the start-up, he did not care much about the profit margin but diverted their efforts in generating brand awareness. He shares, “This is when the advertisement costs are at their maximum. But to put it in numbers, a venture must seek at least 10 per cent to 40 per cent profit margin for it to be sustainable and scalable.”
On employees he says, “The smartest thing to do is ignore the resume because it tells nothing about an employee. We hire them on the basis of their performance during their internship period (which usually lasts for two months). Most of them come through referrals. We also have performance incentives to encourage employees to work at their level best. As for salaries, I believe everyone deserves to be paid well, like the saying goes — if you look after your employees, they will look after your clients.” He opines that he would definitely focus more on technology if he had the chance to start over again. “Over the past four years I have witnessed consumers adapting to changes in technology. People have taken to Facebook and Viber for communication, apps are replacing websites, and such. I was talking to a hotel owner in Pokhara yesterday and he told me, one of the first things people ask for after checking-in is the WiFi password.”
When asked about the Nepal’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, Amun says diversification is the key. “Nepal is now not only relying on tourism and hydropower and banking industries as income generating businesses but there are a lot more new industries that were introduced to the market in the past several years. Therefore, we are definitely on the right track.” His words of wisdom for the ones starting out are, “Start small, really small.
Test your business model before you reach out to the mass. Focus on building systems because this comes in handy when you are scaling your businesses. And always give priority to your brand because revenues can go up and down but your brand is what keeps you going.”

Altice expands in US with USD 17.7 billion Cablevision deal
European telecoms group Altice will become a major force in the lucrative US cable market after it agreed to buy fourth-largest operator Cable vision for a mix of cash and shares in a deal worth USD 17.7 billion including debt.
The move is the latest foray by French-Israeli billionaire and Altice founder Patrick Drahi, who built a telecoms and cable empire in recent years via debt-fueled acquisitions in France, Portugal and Israel.Drahi entered the United States in May by buying small regional cable group Suddenlink for USD 9.1 billion and had declared he would do more acquisitions so as eventually to earn half of Altice’s revenue there.
GM to pay USD 900 million settles US criminal case
General Motors Co (GM.N) has agreed to pay USD 900 million and sign a deferred-prosecution agreement to end a US government investigation into its handling of an ignition-switch defect linked to 124 deaths, two sources told Reuters. The deal means GM will be charged criminally with hiding the defect from regulators and in the process defrauding consumers, but the case will be put on hold while GM fulfills terms of the deal, one source said. No individuals would be charged in the criminal case, one of the sources said. The company’s expected USD 900 million payment, confirmed by a second source, is less than the USD 1.2 billion that Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) paid to resolve a similar case.

Global stocks at three-week highs as Fed decision looms
World stocks inched to a three-week high on Thursday while the dollar drifted lower against other currencies, as investors consolidated positions ahead of a nail-biting US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. There was a sense of relief as much as anything that after months of market speculation and advice from almost everyone from the IMF to the heads of the world’s top companies, that the wait for the Fed’s verdict would be over by 1800 GMT. Europe’s main share markets were left at a virtual standstill with Britain’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 all barely budged after two days of gains helped by a flurry of merger activity.Currency and bond market moves were low key too.
Wal-Mart worker group splits in two
A Wal-Mart Stores Inc worker group that has been one of the loudest voices pushing the retailer to boost wages and improve conditions has splintered over a disagreement about funding and strategic direction, according to people on both sides of the split. Both wings are claiming the name OUR Walmart and vow to continue their work, moves that could sow confusion among supporters.The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which for years has provided important funding and resources to the OUR Walmart worker group, will only financially support the wing that it believes represents the broader set of workers. “Recently we had a group split from us,” said Barbara Getz, who said she is head of the health and safety team for the OUR Walmart grouping that is sticking with UFCW.

AUSTRALIA

US Fed may not hike interest rates
The Australian share market has surged ahead of highly anticipated US Federal Reserve rates call, as energy stocks soar on a strong bounce in crude oil prices. Investors remain upbeat approaching the US Federal Reserve’s decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, with financial markets predicting a 30 per cent chance of lift-off. At the 4.15pm (AEST) official market close, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 added 47.9 points, or 0.94 per cent, to 5146.8 points, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 47.6 points, or 0.93 per cent, to 5171.2 points. The growing sense that the US Fed may not hike interest rates has also pushed the Australian dollar above US72c for the first time in three weeks as per The Australian.
Australian shares rose 1.5 per cent on Thursday for a second straight day of gains as all sectors rallied ahead of the US Fed’s interest rate decision later in the day. Banks and miners were among the clear winners with the “Big Four” lenders rising more than two percent in early trade. A jump in oil prices pushed energy stocks higher. The S&P/ASX 200 index added 73.83 points to 5,172.7 by 0215 GMT. The index closed 1.6 per cent higher on Wednesday, and is on track to post a second straight weekly gain. Analysts said the market could claw back some of the day’s gain as the near-month futures contract expires on Thursday and could add some volatility. Asian stocks hit a three-week high on Thursday after a jump in oil prices lifted Wall Street, with many investors taking last-minute positions ahead of the Fed’s policy decision.

BANGLADESH

Secretary of state for treasury ministry
According to The Daily Star, Poland is interested in investing in mining, coal extraction and installation of liquefied natural gas terminal in Bangladesh as the European country has experience in the sectors, a deputy minister said yesterday. Zdzislaw Gawlik, secretary of state for the treasury ministry, also said his country is keen to explore shell gas in Bangladesh. “We are bringing in very solid proposals of investment in Bangladesh,” he said. “I know Bangladesh is developing at a faster rate. So we are working at the government-to-government and business-to-business levels to intensify bilateral relationship.”
Tea prices in Bangladesh edged higher for a second straight week at the weekly auction on Tuesday amid tight supplies and strong demand for quality leaf. Bangladeshi tea fetched an average 187.93 taka (USD 2.4) per kg at the 19th auction of the current marketing season, slightly up from 185.81 taka at the previous week’s sale when the prices snapped seven-week losing streak, an executive with National Brokers said. There was huge demand for quality tea, while volume dropped again this week compared with last week, helping prices to perk up, the executive said. About 1.93 million kg was offered at the sole auction centre in Chittagong, of which 6.5 per cent was unsold. In the previous auction, about 10 per cent of the 2.17 million kg offered went unsold. The national budget for the 2015/16 fiscal year that started in July raised the regulatory duty on tea imports by five per cent to discourage overseas buying. Tea prices fell sharply in the last marketing season on poor demand from local buyers as business sentiment was hit by renewed political unrest early this year that left more than 120 people dead and disrupted supplies. The country, however, has moved from being a net exporter to a net importer of tea due to rising consumption.

CHINA

Activists rally ouside the White House
China’s economic powerhouse is slowing, destabilising global markets. Beijing’s neighbors, unnerved over its pursuit of territorial claims, are increasingly cosying up to Washington. A threat of US cyber sanctions looms over Chinese companies. It might seem an ideal time for US President Barack Obama to take advantage of Beijing’s troubles and get tough when he hosts Chinese leader Xi Jinping for a state visit on September 25. Obama is expected to press Xi on issues that have strained relations between the two countries, but his approach will be tempered because for better or worse the world’s two biggest economies are inextricably bound together. That will mean a difficult balancing act for Obama. He is under pressure to send a strong message to Xi over cyber spying, Chinese economic policies and South China Sea disputes, but he does not want to upend a summit that could set the tone for relations for his last 16 months in office.
Just as China shows that its domestic stock market can be something of a one-way street — investors can put money in, but not take money out — the biggest mutual fund company, Vanguard Group, is moving ahead with plans to expose more mom-and-pop investors to the country’s heavily restricted exchanges. With the Shanghai stock exchange down by 37 per cent and the Shenzhen exchange off by 43 per cent during the past three months, compared with just an 18 per cent drop on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, Vanguard is adding China mainland stocks to its USD 60 billion emerging markets fund in the coming year.Vanguard says adding A-shares — stocks that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, as opposed to those that trade on the Hong Kong exchange — will diversify the fund, but acknowledges they pose unique risks related to tracking a benchmark. Steps taken by the Chinese government to restrict trading on domestic exchanges make it difficult for index funds to buy the stocks they need to replicate the performance of Chinese benchmarks, fund executives said.

EUROPE

Nestle fails to convince European judges
According to The Guardian, Nestlé has failed in an attempt to convince European judges to let it trademark the shape of the four-finger version of a KitKat in the UK. The European court of justice ruled that the KitKat’s shape was not distinctive enough for consumers to associate it with the chocolate covered wafer. Nestlé is not seeking to trademark its two-fingered version of KitKat. Nestlé had argued that even without its red and white packaging or the word KitKat embossed on the chocolate, the shape of the bar should be regarded as distinct. The dispute between Nestlé and Cadbury, which has fought to prevent Nestlé securing a trademark, will go back to the UK high court for a final ruling that will determine whether rivals will be able to launch copycat KitKats in Britain.Despite the court’s failure to allow the trademark, Nestlé said it was pleased with the ruling.
International creditors expect the first review of Greek reforms under the latest bailout to start in October, bringing changes to a memorandum of understanding signed with Athens and paving the way for debt rescheduling talks, Euro Zone officials said. Euro Zone finance ministers will discuss preparations for Greek reforms envisaged by the third bailout, worth 86 billion euros (USD 96.8 billion), at an informal meeting in Luxembourg on Saturday. No implementation review is possible before Greece’s September 20 parliamentary elections. “There are elections in Greece. We have to wait for the results,” Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna, whose country holds the EU’s rotating presidency, told Reuters in an interview.

INDIA

Reserve Bank of India headquaters, Mumbai
India requires sustained low inflation and a credible programme for fiscal rectitude to lower the cost of capital, Urjit Patel, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said on Thursday, striking a hawkish note after government calls for interest rate cuts to boost the economy. The central banker also said in a speech to a business conference that he expected India’s current account deficit to be 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product in the 2015/16 fiscal year. New banking licences issued by the RBI were also aimed at lowering the cost of capital, Patel said. His remarks addressed concerns that commercial banks have failed to pass on recent cuts in the RBI’s main policy rate to their borrowers.
India plans to address some pending tax disputes in the next few days, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday, but did not give details or say whether the cases in question included disputes with foreign companies that have spooked investors. Earlier this month, the finance ministry decided not to press claims for a Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) against foreign portfolio investors. India remains locked in major back-tax battles with telecoms group Vodafone (VOD.L) and Cairn Energy (CNE.L). Arun Jaitley said last week that the government was trying to resolve pending tax cases, many of them outside the courts.

JAPAN

Workers are seen in a container area at a port
Japan’s exports slowed for a second straight month in August in a worrying sign that China’s economic slowdown could deal a damaging blow to the world’s third-biggest economy and force policymakers to inject fresh stimulus before too long. The data joins a string of depressing shipment numbers in key regional economies — including South Korea and Taiwan — which has heightened anxiety over a China-led slowdown in global growth and tempered bets of the US Federal Reserve lifting rates for the first time in almost a decade later on Thursday.Slowing exports could increase the chance of additional monetary easing from the Bank of Japan, because this could lead to lower factory output, slack economic activity and less momentum needed to offset deflationary pressure caused by a collapse in oil prices.
Vietnam agreed with Japan on Tuesday to step up security cooperation, becoming the latest Southeast Asian country to seek closer ties with Tokyo as China maintains an assertive posture in disputed waters in the South China Sea. The agreement between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Vietnam’s Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong comes after a US expert said on Monday China appeared to be carrying out preparatory work for a third airstrip in contested territory in the South China Sea. China has overlapping claims with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei in the South China Sea. It is also embroiled in a row with Japan over a group of East China Sea islets. Earlier this year, Japan reached an agreement with Malaysia and the Philippines to strengthen security ties.

Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Thursday ahead of a likely policy move by the US Federal Reserve, with stocks in Malaysia outperforming and Singapore hitting a more than one-week high as a big jump in global oil prices boosted energy stocks. Oil prices jumped as much as six per cent on Wednesday after a US stock draw. Oil bulls were also encouraged by doubts on whether the Fed will decide to hike US interest rates on Thursday after tame August inflation data. Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur composite index was up 2.1 per cent on a rally in oil-related stocks. The index touched 1,691.93, a near six-week high, on resuming trade after a market holiday. Shares of oil and gas services firm Sapurakencana Petroleum Bhd was up seven per cent and Tenaga Nasional Bhd was 2.3 per cent higher, among top gainers.
While Malaysia’s premier faces tough questions over the origin of hundreds of millions of dollars transferred to his bank accounts, the country has tentatively received good grades for its anti-money laundering efforts from a team of international experts, documents reviewed by Reuters show. A draft report by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body which monitors how countries fight illicit financial flows, said Malaysia had put in place a “robust policy framework” to combat money laundering.But it said the Asian country needed to be more effective in targeting high-risk offences and needs to pay more attention to transnational crime. The draft, dated Aug 4 and marked for official use, said the FATF inspection team found the Malaysian government had a “strong political commitment and well functioning coordination structures” to fight money laundering and that “significant resources have been allocated” to investigations in this field.

RUSSIA

Launch of new Opel Astra to boost sales
General Motors (GM.N) executives said they remained committed to meeting their goal of reaching profitability in Europe by 2016, brushing aside concerns that a downturn in Russia could put their goal at risk. “We are confident about reaching our goal,” Opel Chief Executive Karl-Thomas Neumann told journalists at the Frankfurt auto show on Tuesday. In July, GM warned its European employees the Opel and Vauxhall brands were still posting significant losses, and meeting its goal of returning to profit by next year would be difficult given the crisis in Russia and the Euro Zone. But General Motors President Dan Ammann said on Tuesday the launch of a new Opel Astra would help boost sales.
Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc on Tuesday said it expected to complete its new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a soon-to-be banned Russian engine, but the date could slip if it does not receive enough US government funding. Aerojet Vice President Julie Van Kleeck declined comment on reports that Aerojet has offered USD two billion to acquire United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 rocket launch venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Analysts say the bid is a strategic move by Aerojet to shut out rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, that is developing a new engine favored by ULA for use in its new Vulcan rocket. ULA has said Blue Origin’s engine programme is about two years ahead of Aerojet’s work on the AR-1 engine, a claim Aerojet disputes.Work on the new engines gained urgency after US lawmakers passed a ban on use of Russian RD-180 engines for launches of US military or spy satellites following Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine last year.

PAKISTAN

Pakistan and Afghanistan have shelved a raft of agreements that promised to more than triple cross-border trade, officials said, as economic ties seen as key to regional stability fall victim to rivalry and suspicion. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani struck the trade deals with Pakistan soon after taking office last year as part of a broader rapprochement that included plans to share intelligence on Taliban insurgents active in both countries. That cooperation was aimed at tackling the Islamist militant movement, which has separate Afghan and Pakistani branches whose violent campaigns kill thousands of people each year and hamper much-needed development. The trade deals were supposed to be a step towards warmer relations and boosting Afghanistan-Pakistan trade from USD 1.6 billion now to USD five billion by 2017. But officials told Reuters that the agreements, which include reducing tariffs and granting each other preferential trade status, have stalled.
Pakistani farmers will receive USD 3.2 billion in grants, subsidies and loan advances from the government, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced on Tuesday, in a bid to spur sluggish growth in one of the country’s main economic sectors. The new schemes represent the government’s largest economic development programme for the agricultural sector since it was voted into office in 2013.The funds will be provided through immediate cash grants and subsidies on agricultural inputs worth USD 1.4 billion, while loan advances worth USD 1.85 billion will also be made and disbursements begin this year, he said. “The conditions of the agricultural sector do not inspire confidence,” Sharif said as he announced the new package at a farmers’ convention in Islamabad. The package includes immediate cash grants for rice and cotton farmers, cuts in fertiliser prices, and a government scheme to pay insurance premiums for farmers who cannot afford them.

THAILAND

TAC plan expansion of it 4G mobile network
Thailand’s Total Access Communication Pcl (TAC) said on Thursday it is planning a major expansion of its fourth generation (4G) mobile network, as it seeks to displace rivals Advanced Info Service Pcl and True Corp. The country’s second largest mobile operator, controlled by Norway’s Telenor, has received regulatory approval to provide 4G services on the 1800MHz frequency band, which is currently used for 2G, Chief Executive Officer Lars Norling told a news conference. TAC also plans to increase its number of base stations to 32,000 in early 2016 from 17,000 now, aiming to provide 4G network coverage nationwide.
The Asian Development Bank will lower its 2015 GDP growth forecast for Thailand from the current 2.9 to 3.0 per cent following weaker-than-expected performance in the first half, the Bangkok Post reported, citing Luxamon Attapich, the bank’s senior economist for Thailand.The new growth forecast, due to be announced on Sept 22, will be higher than 2.5 per cent, the paper reported.

USA

A women walks past the FR headquaters
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has made clear she would rather delay an interest rate hike for too long than move sooner and risk jeopardising a tepid economic recovery, a conviction that will face its sharpest test yet on Thursday. Having weighed the economy’s steady march toward full employment against the backdrop of weak inflation and wage growth and turbulence overseas, the US central bank will issue its latest rate decision at the end of a two-day policy meeting. A rate hike would be the first in the United States in nearly a decade. Fed watchers, however, see the outcome as a toss-up, with Yellen’s consistently stated desire to see workers reap more benefits from the recovery, coupled with weak price rises and a variety of global risks, looming large. “It is a game-time decision. The key is what Yellen thinks and my guess is that she will want to wait,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. “If you put yourself in her shoes, you don’t want to make a mistake by going too soon.”
Oil prices were stable on Thursday as a US stock draw tightened the market while Asia’s economies showed new signs of weakness.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading at USD 47.13 per barrel at 0430 GMT, virtually unchanged from their previous close, while Brent was up 6 cents at USD 49.81 per barrel. That followed a price jump of as much as six per cent in the previous session when data from the US Energy Information Administration showed the largest crude drawdown since February 2014 at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point. Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures said that the stock draw was “a result of higher refining activity and lower US crude production which is helping the US inventory glut to ease off”.

110,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

111,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/weak-institutions-hit-economic-growth/,"Poor spending performance by public institutions a challenge for the economy
KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

KATHMANDU
Traders are simply investing their time, thinking that if they spend a lot of time around the markets, analysing charts, reading books and studying courses, their skill level will improve. Investing time is necessary when you are starting out, as there is a lot to learn. But putting in hours will not necessarily increase your profit potential. If you always repeat the same mistakes, putting in hours will just be meaningless with those habits in place. To improve, make repeated and deliberate choices. Here are five things to start doing today to improve your trading performance.
GET HELP
Trading is tough and not a cup of tea for everyone especially when we go at it completely alone. So choose a person who could be just a friend or family member who you have told your plans to and who you keep updated on your performance. Share what you are doing, what you are struggling with and what you are having success with. Anyone can get side tracked, so be open to being told when you have gone astray. When your own discipline and self-awareness fails, you will have someone to help you get back on track.
FOLLOW YOUR PLAN
Talking about strategies with other traders or discussing your performance with your trading referee is fine, but avoid the opinions of others when it comes to specific trades. Trade your trading plan, your way. It doesn’t matter if a trader you respect says they are going to buy when your plan says to sell.
PRACTICE
A strategy may seem simple on the surface, but even a simple strategy is hard to implement in live market conditions. Every day, every trend, every pullback is slightly different; nothing looks exactly the same as it did in the textbook examples. So trade it in a demoaccount until you consistently see profit from it.
MENTAL CLARITY
Each day take one minute before you trade to make sure you are feeling clearheaded and focused. Also take a couple of seconds to reiterate that you’re here to trade, not check your social media accounts, email or watch videos online. When you trade, simply focus on trading and leave other matters. Check the economic calendar to be aware of events that may move the market, so you are not taken by surprise during the day. If you are angry, upset or unfocused, avoid trading. It only takes one day, one trade even, to lose an entire account when not in the right mind frame.
RECORD YOUR TRADE
Review every trade you make. Take screenshots of your trades with entries, stop loss levels, targets, and your technical/fundamental notes so you can easily review your trades at a later time.

KATHMANDU
Hear it verbatim from Rajesh KC on how he aspires to build a world-class Nepali brand.
“I have been drawing cartoons since 1990s. Back then they were limited to my friend’s portraits but once I got the platform, I was able to polish my skills and dedicate my time and energy to the same. It has been 25 years now and I recently expanded the skills I have to something new.”
On Phalano Luga: “Phalano Luga came to me as a pleasant surprise. A friend of mine who owned a t-shirt store asked me to design a few prints for t-shirts. While designing, I thought to myself, ‘He might give me royalty and I might make some money out of the designs but why not create a Nepali brand in itself?’ I visited stores for market evaluation and realised that even though Nepal has a lot of talent in terms of designs, the fabric was not up to the mark. Even though the t-shirts had tags that said, ‘100 per cent cotton’, something was amiss. Phalano Luga came into existence with an ambition of creating a Nepali brand for Nepalis to wear. With the fabric imported from Ludhiana, India, and the manufacturing factory located in Patan, I have been able to give the market what I had in mind. The printing machines are imported from California and are top class and that is how I had imagined my brand to be — uncompromising and pocket-friendly.”
On growth: “Initially, I had a target of selling at least one t-shirt per day. I thought that the concept of a Nepali brand might take some time to build but I am surprised with the exponential growth Phalano Luga has seen. In the past two years, my dream of selling one t-shirt per day has topped 30 t-shirts per day.”
On workers: “This is one of the bigger challenges I face. Retaining workers and getting the best ones is a big challenge. A group of Nepali workers are coming back to Nepal from Malaysia to work with me. Apart from retaining them, paying them the same amount they used to earn overseas is a challenge. The people I am working with right now are also working with the production unit of Nike, Adidas, Peter England and other such global brands, based in Nepal. The problem is not the quality of the workers, but the economy and the quality of local materials available.”
On funds: “While starting the business off, my bank was skeptical about giving me a loan. My capital investment was close to one crore and after convincing the bank, I had 30 per cent of the costs covered. Most of the funds were drawn from my own pockets.”
On new ventures: “As of now, with more than satisfactory sales, I have the confidence of expanding my business across the country and abroad. But my first priority would be maintaining the quality for a while before dreaming big. Phalano Coffeeghar which is the latest addition to my business venture is something I am looking up to for now. With Phalano Luga doing well, I partnered with an old friend, Prem Aryal and opened the cafe last week. I had the space and he had the ideas, we got together and came up with the Coffeeghar plan. Like the tees, the eatables available at the cafe will all be Nepali-centric. Long term plans for this cafe are branded water bottles and sugar sachets.”
On the future: “I aspire to make Phalano Luga as big as Nike and Adidas.”

Kathmandu
With the country in dire need of post disaster economic recovery, it is expected that governing bodies address the concerns of major contributors to the GDP. The advertising industry is one such sector with the potential to help with economic recovery; and could provide a significant push towards an economic boom, just as the country needs it the most.
Advertising helps create successful businesses, which then lead to employment opportunities. Even media, the driving force behind growing economies, benefits from stability in the industry, as advertising is the chief source of revenue for mass media like newspapers, television, radio, print magazines and websites. Research has consistently shown that countries with larger investments in the advertising industry are more developed than other countries. For instance, the advertisement industry in the United States creates 18.2 million of the 126.7 million jobs. However, back home in Nepal, the predicament of the advertising industry is such that the government is yet to give due recognition to the industry.
According to the Advertising Association of Nepal (AAN), the total annual revenue of the advertising
industry is Rs 5.5 billion. While it is an industry with vast potential; it appears to lack order with various unresolved issues brimming under the surface.
The present scenario
Although at a very slow pace, the industry was witnessing growth before disaster struck. Post earthquake, the scenario looks far from encouraging. Is there a noticeable difference in the industry before and after the earthquake? Ranjit Acharya, CEO of Prisma Advertising says, “Before the earthquake, the industry was in its growing stage. Growth was rather slow but it was growing
nonetheless. Post earthquake, advertising agencies had to cut down on budgets, as it was the need of the hour. With no help from any quarter it was a necessity to cut down costs.” According to him, most businesses had to cut down on advertising budgets, which led to stagnancy in the industry. He says, “A person must seek medical help when ill and not cut down on medicinal costs. The same is with
advertisements.”
Deependra Tandon, Director of Business Advantage says, “In the first few months after the disaster in April/May we did not have any business. We have gradually recovered now and we hope that the business will revive in the festive season.” He adds that the business is still in its infancy and there is room for improvement.
Ahimsa Yonjan, Managing Partner at TBWA\Benchmark Nepal, says, “The earthquakes led to a rather disturbing slowdown for a month or two, but considering everything that has happened, the industry looks to have weathered the storm rather well”. He adds, “However, as an industry, we do not seem to have learned much from the experience, as there is actually very little difference in communication styles or brand behaviour before or after the earthquakes.”
The mushrooming of advertising agencies
AAN has 298 advertising agencies on its member roster, but there still exist several hundred more agencies that are not registered with the association. With so many advertising agencies operating in the market, it is still generally accepted that most of the advertisements that are produced in Nepal are not satisfactory. On this, Santosh Shrestha, President of AAN says, “Because there is no entry barrier to this industry, anyone can register and have an agency up and running in no time. While this opens a lot of doors for newcomers it leads to compromise on the quality. It becomes a tough job to monitor quality.” He further says, “The world of advertising is creative and fascinating. In Nepal, the industry has an estimated growth of 10 to 15 per cent annually. If we focus on quality control, nothing can stop this industry from growing in the coming years.”
Advertising agencies and advertisement standards
On the compromised quality of advertising and agencies not being up to the mark, Shrestha says, “The quality of advertisement depends of the level of awareness of the society, resources, budget and the economy. Advertisements reflect the attitude of the society. The market is small and the economy is not
progressive. The current focus is on production of effective advertisements rather than creative ones.”
He adds that they are responsible to cater to the mass with limited budget. He says, “Suppose there are three kids who study in grade three, six and eight. Now, all of them must be explained to in a similar manner, in a language they can comprehend. The teacher explains in the easiest way so that every one can understand. The same goes with advertisement.”
Joydeb Chackravarty, Managing Director, JWT – Thompson Nepal has a different view on this subject. He says, “Nepali consumers are exposed to creative advertisements, if not from within the country, but definitely from the world outside. They are intelligent and they know exactly what they want.
Advertisers should not underestimate their level of awareness and should not doubt their intelligence.”
He says that it is high time for the industry to push the envelope in terms of standards and creativity.
Yonjan says, “While I do agree that the overall quality of advertising could be a lot better, I think it is quite unfair to generalise and say that the quality of advertising agencies is not up to the mark. There are a few agencies doing good work locally, so we must give credit where it is due.” He further says, “As with any other industry however, a combination of many factors; such as, lack of industry knowledge and processes, timelines, an unwillingness to provide proper compensation on the side of all parties involved, leads to a large proportion of work being of poor quality. It is the same with art, music and movies. Much of what is produced is quite terrible, but there are those that stand out.”
The clean feed debate
For almost eight years now, AAN has lobbied with the government to introduce a Clean Feed Policy. This policy will ensure content filtering systems that can be used to block foreign commercials aired through foreign channels from reaching the Nepali audience. The main purpose of this policy will be to eliminate the trend of dubbing and encourage multinationals to produce and develop advertisements through local agencies.
Nirmal Raj Poudel, CEO of Welcome Advertising and Marketing, says, “Multinational companies dub foreign advertisements and broadcast them in local channels.  Further, the paid channels also include commercials. This results in quality compromise.”
However, some industrialists claim that clean feed is an uphill task in Nepal. They argue that competition will be killed with the introduction of this policy. A Clean Feed Committee has meanwhile been formed by AAN that has been doing research on the topic and is under dialogue with the government for a quick implementation of this policy.
The right way of doing things
According to some, one of the biggest challenges the industry currently faces is the lack of vision and leadership within the industry. Only self- regulation and quality checks can turn the industry around. Tandon says, “The change must start with the industry itself. Introducing policies is not enough for the development of the industry.” Yonjan has similar views, he says, “We cannot introduce laws to control or fix what are inherently industry problems. What is more necessary is an independent regulatory body that can develop and enforce a code of conduct/best practice model in place for the overall advertising market.”
Although the advertising industry is currently facing an uphill battle, this is still an industry that has enormous potential. With the industry only just beginning to mature, and mediums like digital and new age media opening up, there appears to be much to look forward to for the industry. For the rest of us, it remains the industry to watch.
In parting, it is perhaps Chakravarty who sums it up best — “The next five years are going to be challenging for the advertising industry in Nepal. However, if we follow the right way of doing things and remain honest and integrated there are chances that we can recover soon.”

The monsoon struck the village mid-June, but officials of Sangachowk VDC are still struggling to distribute cash relief to villagers.
Currently, the villagers are living inside temporary shelters made from rusted zinc sheets riddled with holes and timber salvaged from their damaged houses. They kept some zinc sheets and timber to shelter their cattle and poultry after distribution of relief amount was delayed.
Shyam Khadka, 55, of Pokhre said,”The rain water trickles through the zinc sheets. The families of my three sons are housed under one small temporary shelter. Even if the government distributes relief money it will not be sufficient to procure zinc sheets to construct temporary shelters that will accommodate the families of my three sons.”
Basanta Prasad Ghimire, secretary, Sangachowk VDC said cash relief had not been distributed as the registered households claiming cash relief outnumbered the actual damaged households.
“Over 28,000 households have registered for cash relief, whereas, the District Administration Office has allocated cash relief for only 22,000 households on the basis of existing documented records before the earthquake of April 25,” he said.
The government had announced immediate cash relief of Rs 15,000 for one damaged house. The joint families who have not legally divided properties are not eligible for immediate cash relief even if they had been staying in separate houses.
“The joint families who lost more than one house registered fore cash relief under names of different members of the same family,” Ghimire said, stressing that families who had lost more than one house are not satisfied with government policy.
He warned that a monitoring team comprising ward citizens’ forum would be deployed to find such joint families who had registered more than once for the same house before issuing the ID card to claim immediate cash relief and Rs 200,000 to further build a permanent house.
The government released Rs 5.53 billion to the local authorities for immediate relief countrywide in May.
According to District Disaster Relief Committee, the death toll was 3,656 in Sindhupalchowk. About 90 per cent of houses in the district were razed to the ground.

116,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/duplication-in-tax-headings-draws-flak/,"KATHMANDU: The draft of the new constitution has overlooked the concerns related to effective levying of major taxes and duplicated some tax headings in central and state governments, as well as provincial and local governments.
Such duplications might pose a threat to the revenue system once the country adopts a federal structure due to disputes of power allocation between central and provincial government to levy taxes, according to tax experts.
The draft constitution has proposed that excise and individual income tax can be levied by both the central and provincial governments. Similarly, it has also proposed that many other tax headings be levied by the provincial and local governments, like registration tax, vehicle tax and tourist fee.
“Even as related Acts will have to be formulated, the power allocation in the central, provincial and local governments will result in disputes when the laws related to taxes are enforced in the coming days,” opined Rup Khadka, tax expert and the chair of the government-formed High Level Tax System Review Commission. The draft constitution has extended authority to levy taxes, but it is silent on power allocation regarding enforcement, like what portion of the excise duty and IIT can be levied by the province and the portion of the registration and vehicle and land tax that can be levied by the local government.
Giving an example of South Sudan, Khadka said, “The taxes proposed to be levied by the central government were also placed in the domain of provincial government, which led to a dispute. It was later sorted out by forming a task force under the chairmanship of the finance minister of the centre, comprising finance ministers of provinces.”
According to him, it would be better to extend the authority to levy a certain tax to a particular government that can effectively levy that duty. “That power can be shared among other governments.”
The HLTSRC has suggested the finance committee of the Parliament to put customs, VAT, excise, corporate and individual income tax under the domain of the central government for effective enforcement, as these taxes are of stra-tegic importance and strong institutional mechanism is required to levy them effectively. Likewise, registration tax and vehicle tax have been recommended to be levied by provincial government.
Who is to levy what
Central government: Customs, excise, value added tax, corporate income tax, individual income tax, passport fee, visa fee, penalties and royalty of natural resources Provincial government: Wage tax (which covers large portion of individual income tax), land tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, excise, entertainment tax, advertisement tax, tourist fees, agriculture income tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources
Local government: Land and rent tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, service fees, tourist fees, business tax, entertainment tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources

117,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/development-bond-yields-fall-to-all-time-low/,"KATHMANDU: Yield on development bonds, regardless of their maturity period, has fallen to an all-time low, dampening sentiment of bankers, who have to tap the government securities market to meet some of the regulatory requirements.
Return on 15-year development bonds floated today by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) dropped to 2.65 per cent, the lowest since February 1964, when the government first introduced development bonds with a maturity period of five years to raise debt from the domestic market to finance development activities.
Surprisingly, returns on these securities are falling lately even as their maturity period is increasing.
When NRB auctioned five-year development bonds on May 28, the weighted average cut-off rate stood at four per cent. Then on June 4, when it floated seven-year development bonds, the return fell to 3.44 per cent.
The yield further dropped to 3.08 per cent when NRB offered nine-year development bonds on June 11.
The freefall continued on June 25 as well, when 10-year development bonds were floated. At that time, the weighted average interest rate had dropped to 2.99 per cent.
Considering 7.1 per cent inflation of mid-May, returns on these securities are negative in real term.
“Yields on bonds are falling rapidly because of excess liquidity in the banking sector,” Nara Bahadur Thapa, chief of Public Debt Management Department at NRB told The Himalayan Times.
Banks and financial institutions (BFIs) are currently sitting on excess liquidity of over Rs 70 billion. However, a large chunk of this money cannot be extended as loans because it is being used to meet the minimum regulatory net liquid asset to total deposit ratio, or LD ratio, of 20 per cent.
So, BFIs are rushing to grab these low-yielding securities assuming it is wiser to invest funds in bonds and get some returns rather than let them sit in coffers and generate no return.
Lately, what also appears to have exerted pressure on yields is the government’s decision to repay a part of debt.
So far this fiscal, the government has repaid Rs 42.55 billion of debt, including principal, shows the latest NRB report.
On the other hand, fresh government securities worth only Rs 42.34 billion have been floated in the market. This means net borrowing of the government stood at a negative of around Rs 211 million.
“Because of this, BFIs are rushing to replenish their stock of government securities to maintain LD ratio. This is raising the demand for bonds,” Thapa said, adding, “This is another reason for fall in bond returns.”
The falling bond return is, in fact, good news for the government, as it is now able to raise domestic debt at low interest rates. This means the cost of rebuilding parts of the country ravaged by the earthquake would be a little cheaper.
But bankers say this is creating ‘distortions’ in the market.
“Many BFIs that have purchased low-yielding instruments are now carrying a lot of market risk,” said Sashin Joshi, CEO of Nabil Bank.
This is because purchase of nine-, 10- and 15-year bonds is not a short-term investment, according to Joshi.
“And if returns on bonds rise next year, the instruments bought this year will turn into nothing but loss-making tools. At that time, many BFIs will have no option but to sell those instruments at a discount. This may hit their profitability as well,” Joshi added.

KATHMANDU: There is now little doubt that Pashupati Murarka, officiating president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), will take the helm of the largest private sector umbrella body tomorrow.
Murarka taking the lead of FNCCI has become a certainty after the two other contenders — Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar and Bhawani Rana — withdrew their candidacy for the post of FNCCI president from the election slated for tomorrow.
Organising a press meet on Tuesday, Rajkarnikar had announced his willingness to withdraw his candidacy and support Murarka if Rana also did the same. After Rana formally withdrew her candidacy yesterday, Rajkarnikar also formally pulled out his application today.
So, Murarka is the sole contender for the top post of FNCCI and will be announced as the unanimous president tomorrow. It also means that the post of senior vice president, which Murarka held before he took on the role of officiating chief of FNCCI, will be vacant.
Murarka had been appointed as the officiating president after its past president Pradeep Jung Pandey was arrested in a three-decade old corruption charge on March 18.
As per the FNCCI statute, election of the senior vice president should be done within five days of the president’s election. The senior vice president is elected from the executive committee, though the rest of the posts are filled through direct election.
According to FNCCI sources, there is general consensus among FNCCI members to select Bhawani Rana for the post of senior vice president. Leaders of the largest private sector umbrella body have claimed that rifts and groupism that occurred during the past elections will be bridged after the selection of a unanimous chief at FNCCI.

Nepal is hosting the Donors’ Conference for the reconstruction of the country in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes.
“Media reports that there was clash between us and there was lack of coordination while sending invitations to neighbouring countries are baseless. The finance minister and I were supposed to go to India and China respectively. But, I cancelled my visit to China after Chinese authorities informed us that Chinese foreign minister will not be able to participate in the conference due to prior engagement,” Pandey told the meeting of
National Disaster Management and Monitoring Special Committee of the Legislature Parliament headed by Speaker Subas Chandra Nembang today.
Finance Minister Mahat said that his ministry had prepared the 300-page Post Disaster Need Assessment, with the help of more than 200 experts divided into 23 sub-panels by working round the clock in view of the conference. “This is the official document of the government detailing the damage and need assessment. This document has created the base to see support from donor countries and inter-country agencies,” Mahat said.
The government has invited 65 countries and inter-governmental agencies, said Finance Mahat, adding: “Of them, 125 delegates of 40 countries and agencies have already expressed their commitment to participate in the conference”. Seven minister-level participants have sent their confirmation to participate in the conference, according to Mahat.
“Initially, donor countries wished to delay the conference to August-September. Citing the devastating earthquake situation, they proposed to hold the conference in New Delhi of India, Tokyo of Japan and Paris of France. They were reluctant to participate in the conference expressing their doubt over the safety of the participants as the situation had not been normal. However, we persistently stood on our stance of holding the conference in Kathmandu and made all arrangements for their safe living during their stay here. Ultimately, the donors were convinced and are expressing their commitment for their participation,” Mahat said.
Mahat said that the government would focus on foreign grant collection, sharing experiences of managing post-disaster situation and solidarity of friendly nations to Nepal’s crisis.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Pandey said that the government wanted to show the international community that the country was safe for tourism and it maintained complete harmony during the national crisis despite having around 125 different communities.
Mahat, responding to a complaint that Russian ambassador in Kathmandu did not get invitation till last Wednesday due to the government’s carelessness, said, “The government, six weeks ago, had emailed all the embassies and ambassadors in Kathmandu, making preliminary request to participate in the conference. The [Russian] ambassador had replied us via email that the country’s representative would not be able to participate in the conference due to pre-scheduled engagement on the conference day. Then, we did not send invitation to him. But, after we heard about the complaint, we have sent an invitation recently.”
Lawmakers including CPN-UML’s Madhav Kumar Nepal, Nepali Congress’s Ramchandra Paudel and Unified CPN-Maoist’s Girirajmani Pokharel, had urged the ministries to clarify the controversies related to the conference and suggested them to make the conference a success.
After listening to the two ministers, panel Chair Nembang instructed the government to take the neighboring countries and donors into confidence and also consultations with all the parties and take their feedback. Nembang also instructed the government to make an arrangement for making the foreign delegates observe the major tourist areas — both damaged and not damaged — independently during their visit to give a message that Nepal is safe for foreign tourists.

The ordinance will now be sent to the President for certification.
The Authority, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister, is being set up prior to the international donors’ conference, scheduled for June 25, which aims at seeking support from the international communities to rebuild Nepal.
When the ordinance is certified, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala will nominate four ministers and three experts as members of the high-level body, according to Minister for General Administration Lalbabu Pandit.
Likewise, Vice-Chairperson of the National Planning Commission and Chief Secretary will be members of the Authority.
The post-earthquake Reconstruction Authority will have a chief executive officer also. It will oversee all reconstruction works in the earthquake-hit districts where physical infrastructures have been damaged.
Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam informed that there will be a separate committee of foreign consultants that would be constantly supporting the Authority in its job.
According to the government’s assessment, the tremors caused damage worth Rs 513.38 billion to physical infrastructure and assets, and inflicted income loss of another Rs 187.08 billion.
The government has set the target to collect more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors for the post-earthquake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
 Objectives of International Conference on Nepal’s Reconstruction


Appraise friendly countries and development partners of the socio-economic situation in Nepal in the aftermath of the massive earthquake and share international best practices and experiences on institutional arrangements that lead to effective, transparent and accountable execution of reconstruction programs.
Disseminate the findings of the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA).
Update the Government’s policies and institutional mechanism for post earthquake reconstruction and new construction
Seek technical and financial support for reconstruction and rally the support and solidarity of all friends and partners for a resilient recovery of Nepal and its people.

Nepal had invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang to take part in the conference, scheduled for June 25, being organised to seek the international communities’ support in the reconstruction of country devastated by the April 25 earthquake and its subsequent aftershocks.
The two leaders, however, expressed their inability to attend the conference, citing conflict of schedules, and are sending senior ministers to represent their respective governments.
Nepal had extended invitation to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang through the Chinese mission in Kathmandu, while Minister for Finance Dr Ram Sharan Mahat had visited New Delhi to hand over the invitation to Modi.
According to MoHA, the Indian minister will arrive in Kathmandu on June 24 and return to New Delhi after the one-day conference concludes the following day.
It is believed that Beijing is sending Foreign Minister Wang Yi to attend the conference.
Nepal is still awaiting final confirmation from the Chinese side, according to the source.

KATHMANDU: The government will seek more grant assistance than loans for the reconstruction operations in wake of the devastating April 25 earthquake, said Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat.
He, however, added that the nation also needs some long-term loads at a lower interest rate.

He reiterated that the reconstruction campaign is not possible without support from the international community.
The Minister informed that Nepal has stressed on participation of higher-level representatives at the conference. “Many nations and organisations have assured us for the same,” Mahat claimed, “We have prepared well for success of the conference.”
The Ministry had invited former ministers, former NPC vice-chairs and former secretaries to collect suggestions for the event.
Ex-ministers Surendra Pande, Barshaman Pun and Shankar Koirala; former NPC vice-chairs Jagadish Pokhrel, Yuvaraj Khatiwada, Dipendra Bahadur Chhetri and Rabindra Kumar Shakya; former chief secretaries Bimal Prasad Koirala and Bhoj Raj Ghimire among others had floated their suggestions at the meeting.

The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority registered 170 cases of corruption in the current fiscal 2019-20.
The CIAA finding is that employees of government offices established with special and specific purposes are also indulging in corruption. When analysing corruption charge sheets registered by the CIAA at the Special Court of late, some people were found to have been amassing property in an unusual way.
A non-gazetted first class officer has been found accumulating property worth Rs 148 million during his official career while an accountant at the Transport Management Department has been found to have amassed property worth Rs 620 million.

CIAA Chief Commissioner Nabeen Kumar Ghimire said audiovisual clips collected from some offices suggested that corruption was rampant in the country. “Mentality of making a quick buck to become millionaire upon joining the service is highly prevalent,” he said, underlining the need to cultivate integrity and control corruption.
In his address at a programme organised by the CIAA on the occasion of International Anti-corruption Day here today, the chief commissioner said, “The CIAA is studying the economic status of over 15,000 senior and other government employees.”
Rapid Action Taskforce has been targeting offices facing an increased flow of service seekers. Besides, such offices are under the CIAA surveillance through other mechanisms. He also said that during the last fiscal, CIAA had registered 251  corruption cases at the Special Court and got success in 88 per cent of the cases. He further said that in case of offices related to public procurement, chief and secretary should be held more responsible for controlling corruption and culture of avoiding responsibility must be discouraged.
According to the CIAA, test laboratory has been established in Bardibas and Nepalgunj to maintain the standard in construction projects by averting the possibility of substandard construction materials and other non-standard procedures. Such type of laboratory will be established in other places as well.
In the past, increased number of complaints were related to the bodies under the Ministry of Education, but lately more complaints  about irregularities are related to local governments, according to him. He added that last year, it had carried out monitoring of 1,848 projects and gave suggestions to the government. Some suggestions were implemented and contract agreements of some snail-paced projects were cancelled.
It was a matter of concern that Nepal continues to make its presence in the higher position of the corruption list. “We are committed to improving the status by 10 per cent in the next five years.” Nepal was ranked 124 in Corruption Perception Index-2018 as per the study conducted by Transparency International, falling from 122 in 2017.
Chief Commissioner Ghimire underscored the need to seriously internalise the service-oriented mentality. He shared that efforts were under way to curb political interference in Public Procurement.
The CIAA, on the occasion, made public its five-year institutional strategy beginning from the current fiscal. The plan underlines preventive, curative, promotional and institutional capacity building.

The Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police has arrested American citizen Jason Lloyd Moody on the charge of sexually abusing three girls below 11.
The 40-year-old resident of Illinois was arrested from Room No 104 of Memorable Guest House near Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu yesterday in a ‘compromising position’ with two 10-year-old girls, according to police. Moody, who has been visiting Nepal since 2014, faces charges of sexually abusing at least four underage boys as well.
Police had intensified search for Moody five days ago after getting a tip-off that an American was luring young boys into a hotel in the airport area. “But we were not able to nab him initially as there was no trace of boys who had fallen victim to paedophilia,” CIB’s Superintendent of Police Bel Bahadur Pandey said. “Luckily, we came across a girl, who looked frightened and behaved in a suspicious manner. She told us she had been sexually abused by a foreigner and had escaped from his clutches.”
That girl led police to the hotel. Police entered Moody’s room on the first floor of the hotel by breaking through the back door. Moody was seen hastily putting on his clothes and was asking two other minors to do the same after police barged in, according to Pandey.
“One of the girls confirmed that Moody had raped her. How the other two girls were abused is still unclear,” said Pandey. All the girls are undergoing medical check-up. “Albeit Moody has refused to undergo medical test,” said SP Pandey.
Two of the rescued girls are Indian cousins aged 10, while one is a nine-year-old Nepali. All of them live in a squatter settlement on the banks of the Bagmati River, a few hundred metres from the airport area.
Parents of one of the girls have formally lodged a police complaint accusing Moody of raping their child. Two other parents have accused the American of attempting to rape their children.
“We have come to know that Moody has abused four other boys as well,” said Pandey. “We are trying to find those victims who also reside in the squatter settlement near the airport.”
Moody, according to Pandey, was well known in the squatter settlement, where he used to distribute food, chocolates and money among children. “He was thus welcomed by children’s parents, most of who are daily wage earners.”
Moody is a frequent visitor to Nepal. He first visited the country in June 2014 and stayed here for a month. He returned to Nepal in August 2016 and stayed here till December. He made a third visit to Nepal in January 2017 for a period of three months. The last time he arrived in Nepal was in August 2019. He has since been living here and has also joined Biswo Bhasa College to study Nepali language.
Prof Subodhshukla Yajurveda recalled seeing Moody a few times in the college. “But he was not a regular student and did not communicate much with friends or faculty,” he said.
Besides his passport, police have confiscated two additional US passports from Moody’s hotel room, along with a laptop, ATM cards, credit cards, cheques and an identity card issued by Biswo Bhasa College.

Secretary General of South Asian Association for Regional Corporation Amjad Hussain B Sial has extended felicitation to the member states of SAARC and their people on the
the occasion of the 35th SAARC Charter Day.
“As we commemorate this day, I also wish to reaffirm our conviction and commitment to make SAARC more robust, dynamic and capable of attaining the Charter objectives,” he said in a message. At the first SAARC Summit in Dhaka, the heads of state or government of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka adopted the SAARC Charter on 8 December 1985, reaffirming their resolve to promote regional collaboration under the auspices of the association. Afghanistan became the eighth member of SAARC in April, 2007.
SAARC was formed primarily to promote welfare of the people of South Asia and improve their quality of life. “Since its inception in December 1985, SAARC has made steady progress in promoting regional collaboration in agreed priority areas. Strenuous inter-governmental efforts are under way to achieve the coveted objectives enshrined in the Charter, as well as the goal of the South Asian Economic Union as envisioned by our leaders,” Sial said.
According to him, improved intra-regional connectivity was essential for effective regional integration and promoting economic relations, people-to-people contacts and tourism. “In order to achieve these objectives, three important agreements — SAARC Motor Vehicles Agreement, SAARC Railways Agreement and SAARC Air Services Agreement — are under consideration of the member states. It is earnestly hoped that the SAARC passenger and ferry services will be operational in the near future,” he said.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended his greetings and felicitations to the people of SAARC countries on the occasion of the SAARC Charter Day. “SAARC, set up as an organisation to build a connected and integrated South Asia, aims at promoting development and progress of all countries in the region. India continues to support various initiatives to achieve closer cooperation in diverse areas,” Modi said in a message circulated by the SAARC Secretariat in Kathmandu.
“SAARC has made progress, but more needs to be done. Our efforts for greater collaboration have repeatedly been challenged by threats and acts of terrorism. Such environment impedes our shared objective of realising the full potential of SAARC. It is critical that all countries in the region take effective steps to defeat the scourge of terrorism and the forces that support it.
This will generate greater trust and confidence to build a stronger SAARC,” the Indian prime minister added.

Buddhist religious routes can attract pilgrims from across the world to Nepal

Kathmandu, December 8
Cultural experts, historians and people from tourism fraternity stressed on identifying the route traversed by Padmasambhava, a Buddhist religious leader from Nepal, to Tibet in the eighth century. The route would attract Buddhist pilgrims from across the world to Nepal, they said.
The route and religious tourism were discussed at ‘Barbara Adams talk series -VI’, organised by Barbara Foundation.
Padmasambhava also known as Guru Rinpoche in Buddhist religion was one of the prominent followers of Buddhism, who spread Buddhist teaching in Tibet. He is also revered as the second Buddha.
Ramesh Dhungel a cultural expert and Buddhist historian, presenting his paper titled ‘The Unique Spiritual Route of Padmasambhava from Nepal Mandal to Walung Valley’ said at least three South to North routes traversed by Padmasambahava from Nepal to Tibet could be identified. The first route was far-western range originating from Dang Valley leading to Tibet through Dipayal-Doti-Tinker and Kakra Khat bypass. The second route originated from Kathmandu and ran through Nuwakot-Rasuwa-Kerung-Mustang-Sikachhe-Lasha, leading to Tibet. The third and the most important route also started from Kathmandu and passed along Namo Buddha in Kavre-Dolakha-Ramechhap-Okhaldunga-Diktel-Taplegunj and Dipta-la pass ending inTibet.
“There are hundreds of religious sites along the third route, which bear greater religious significance for Buddhists across the world. These places can be flocked by international pilgrims if proper promotional programs are introduced,” Dhungel said.
Yogesh Bhattarai Minister of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation said establishing similar routes or circuits would not only help achieve the goal of welcoming two million tourists in the country, but would make tourists stay longer in the country. “We are exploring new destinations as tourists normally do not like to visit the same place twice. We are open to support ancient routes for tourists,” Minister Bhattarai said. He also said the ministry would support and facilitate researchers to study about similar projects so that more routes could be identified.
Historian Tri Ratna Manandhar said many things remained yet be discovered about the trails Guru Rinpoche had traversed. He said Dhungel’s study was important as it combined history and geography.
“This research has shed new light in Nepali academia as Nepali education system did not combine history with geography,” he said. He added that Himalayan ranges have been attracting saints and sages from across the world and combined study of history with geography could reveal trans-border movement in the ancient period.

Chair of the National Human Rights Commission Anup Raj Sharma today said there were many challenges to protect and promote human rights in the country. He said this after submitting the rights body’s annual report to President Bidhya Devi Bhandari.
Sharma said the bill brought by the government to amend the NHRC Act was aimed at curtailing the independence and autonomy of the rights body. He said there were ambiguities in the powers between the NHRC and other constitutional commissions. Sharma said the conflict victims had not been able to get justice even 13 years after the end of conflict.
Sharma said people were still deprived of enjoying their constitutional rights as problems of child marriage, violence against women continued unabated in the country and people lacked access to justice and health services. Sharma said the government was not paying attention to the concerns of deprived communities, indigenous nationality, differently abled, Dalit, women, senior citizens and sexual minorities.
Stating that impunity was still a challenge, Sharma said the NHRC was not getting cooperation from the government and its recommendations were not being implemented by the government.
According to the annual report, NHRC received 232 complaints this year and it carried out its investigation in 600 complaints including those lodged in previous years. The rights body decided and issued recommendation in 82 cases besides carrying out 219 human rights protection programmes. It has published 26 reports this year.

With the bill session of the Federal Parliament likely to kick off in mid-December, leaders of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) have intensified informal talks for the election of a new speaker of the House of Representatives.
Party insiders say although NCP co-chairmen — Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal — are the ones who will take a decision, aspiring leaders have informally started to make a case for why they deserved the post. The post has fallen vacant after Krishna Bahadur Mahara’s resignation following rape allegations.
While Agni Sapkota representing the former CPN-MC and Subas Nembang representing the former CPN-UML appear front-runners, HoR Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, backed by some NCP women lawmakers, is apparently unwilling to resign.
It was earlier reported that the party leadership had requested Tumbahamphe to resign to induct her in the Cabinet in the recent Cabinet reshuffle. However, she refused to put in her papers. She had publicly stated that it would not be a wise decision to leave the parliament leaderless. Although not so strong, there’s sustained lobbying effort within the ruling party to elevate women lawmakers to top positions.
Tumbahamphe’s resignation is a must for the election of speaker from among NCP lawmakers. The Constitution’s Article 91 (2) states that the election shall be in such a way that either the speaker or the deputy speaker is a woman, and they should be from different parties. This means Tumbahamphe must resign even if she is to be elected speaker.
Despite the constitutional provision, the NCP had kept with itself both the posts of speaker and deputy speaker on grounds that Mahara (from former CPN-MC) and Tumbahamphe (from former CPN-UML) belonged to different parties at the time of their appointment. The two parties later merged to become the NCP.
If Tumbahamphe refuses to resign, the NCP has to give up the speaker’s post given the constitutional provision. However, the NCP is in no mood to give up the crucial top post although it certainly has to give up the deputy speaker’s post. “It’s almost certain that the NCP will keep the post of speaker with itself,” said a senior leader of the NCP.
Complications, however, do not end here. Election of Mahara and Tumbahamphe was done on the basis of seat sharing among former CPN-MC and CPN-UML. As per the then understanding, the former CPN-MC bagged HoR speaker and National Assembly deputy chairperson posts, while the former CPN-UML was allocated NC chairperson and HoR deputy speaker posts.
So there’s another strong lobby from NCP lawmakers representing former CPN-MC that the new speaker be elected from among them. On the other hand, those representing the former CPN-UML are of the view that since the parties have already been merged, promoting factionalism would only weaken the party.
“It is up to the chairmen duo to decide on that. Nobody knows what they are up to,” said another senior leader of the NCP. “They might have reached an understanding on how to move ahead on all these issues, including remaining tasks of the party unification, when Dahal was assigned executive role.”
Dahal has lately been expediting meetings in prelude to tomorrow’s secretariat meeting under his chairmanship. While he met PM Oli and Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Ishwor Pokhrel yesterday, he held a rather long meeting with NCP Senior Leader Madhav Kumar Nepal today. Knowledgeable sources said the talks mostly centred on the agendas for tomorrow’s secretariat meeting, such as calling meeting of central and the standing committees, introspection of the recently-held by-elections, and concluding remaining tasks of party unification. However, the secretariat is also expected to discuss the appointment of the HoR speaker. NCP Spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha said although the matter was not on the agenda for tomorrow’s secretariat meeting, it might be discussed since it is a pertinent issue.

135,https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/government-aims-to-achieve-gender-equality-by-2030/,"Kathmandu, December 8
The government has drafted National Gender Equality Policy-2019, to institutionalise gender responsive governance system in its three tiers, make annual budget gender-friendly and establish equitable, prosperous and justifiable society.
The policy is in line with the constitution. Article 38 of the constitution states that every woman shall have equal lineage rights without gender based discrimination and no woman shall be subjected to physical, mental, sexual, psychological or other forms of violence or exploitation on grounds of religion, social, cultural tradition, practice or on any other grounds. Women have the right to participate in all bodies of the state on the basis of the principle of proportional inclusion, and obtain special opportunities in education, health, employment and social security, on the basis of positive discrimination.
It was necessary to develop the policy as Nepal is also a party to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women adopted in 1979, by the United Nations General Assembly. The vision of the policy is ‘building nation with gender equality’ and it has set the goal of achieving gender equality by 2030, through economic and social empowerment of women.
The policy has the objectives to remove discriminatory barrier to socioeconomic development of women, children and adolescent girls; end gender-based violence; adopt gender responsive governance system; and achieve economic empowerment of women.
In order to carry out these objectives, the government will implement the fundamental rights of women and relevant laws in an effective manner; conduct social awareness programmes; bring about consistency among the federal, provincial and local laws; develop gender-friendly family and society; strongly enforce the policy of zero tolerance against gender-based violence; adopt gender responsive policy while making policies, plans and laws; empower women to ensure their access to all bodies of the state; increase the participation of women in income-generating activities; reduce business and social risk in economic activities of women and ensure their equal representation in decision level.
The proposed policy also said orientation programmes would be conducted for the stakeholders to make them realise the need for special law related to gender equality. “Community organisations and local groups will be mobilised to end all forms of discrimination and violence against women besides implementing polices and programmes for gender equality and proportional inclusion,” it read.
Special provision will be made to ensure equal opportunity for marginalised, minority and rural women in all areas. “Gender equality will be promoted from elementary school level by incorporating this subject into the curricula.
Existing laws will be strongly enforced to end sexual harassment at workplace and public places,” the policy stated. It also stated that Women and Children Service Centre of Nepal Police will be further strengthened to discourage violence against women and children through legal remedy.
The policy mentioned of a provision for establishment and operation of protection and rehabilitation houses for women and children affected by violence, while making them aware of negative impacts of cybercrime. It has treated chhaupadi practice as gender-based violence as many women and girls are still prohibited from participating in normal family activities during menstruating.
“More women will be engaged for the development of national economy and economic surveys will be conducted to realise their contribution for the nation’s prosperity. For this, exclusive skill development programmes will be conducted for women. Women entrepreneurship fund will be promoted and mobilised,” the policy read.
It also mentioned that a profile of women economists would be prepared to encourage them to play leading role in creating more employment opportunities for women.
The policy has provisioned a 14-member Gender Quality National Steering Committee led by the minister of Women, Children and Senior Citizen for its effective implementation.

Traffic police have taken action against as man as 909 cabbies over a period of one month (mid-October to mid-November) for fleecing the passengers or violating the rules in Kathmandu valley.
According to statistics released by Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, most of the taxi drivers booked by on-duty cops were caught in the act of bargaining the fare or refusing to provide service by turning on the meter.

A total of 903 cabbies bargained over fare without turning on the meter. Similarly, two taxi drivers had tampered with the meter and seven were operating taxis by replacing the black registration plate with red one against the permit granted to them.
Traffic police have intensified action against unscrupulous cabbies as they showed no sign of adhering to the rules. Traffic personnel, both in uniform and plain clothes have been deployed in busy areas, including hospitals and bus parks to catch the rule violators. Recently, it has begun keeping a tab on taxis, in the daytime and at night, when cabbies try to fleece passengers taking advantage of emergencies and non-availability of public vehicles.
Plainclothes traffic cops have been deployed in busy thoroughfares to monitor and regulate taxi service. According to MTPD, on an average, 30 cabbies are booked on a daily basis for fleecing commuters.
MTPD has appealed to passengers to call the traffic control room (103) or send SMS to 9851295100 or file a complaint through MTPD’s Facebook page to initiate action against fraudulent taxi drivers.
Cabbies, who refuse to serve passengers by turning on fare-meter, are referred to the Transport Management Office for action and are fined Rs 2,000. Similarly, if a taxi driver is found operating with a tampered meter, the National Bureau of Standards and Metrology may impose a fine of up to Rs 5,000, along with a warning in the first instance.

Amidst the ongoing 13th South Asian Games, scores of social activists and young players today gathered at Tundikhel expressing their solidarity with Occupy Tundikhel campaigners.
The campaign has entered the fifth week. Ever since the beginning of the campaign, activists have been organising various programmes to exert pressure on the government to stop encroachment of Khula Manch, a part of Tundikhel in the past, and also to make people aware about importance of open space.

The slogan for today’s programme organised as part of the campaign was ‘players for nation: Open space for players’
Organisers said the event aimed to highlight the importance of open spaces. Bijay Shrestha, coordinator of Occupy Tundikhel campaign, said, “Today’s event has given the message that the public should be given unrestricted access to open areas such as Tundikhle where locals youths can develop their athletic and sportsmanship skills.” Shrestha also said open spaces were very important for city denizens, including elderly citisens, as it would provide space for physical fitness and fresh air to breathe.

Locals who used to gather at Tundikhel to play cricket and football also participated in today’s programme. According to historians, before 1950, Tundikhel covered the area ranging form Dasharath Stadium in the south to Rani Pokhari in the north. The area, which has been occupied by Nepali Army’s headquarters at present from Shahidgate in the north to Dasharath Stadium in the South was a part of Tundikhel until 1967, according to Bhimsen Das Pradhan, a lawmaker.
At present, the area of Tundikhel has shrunk to the Nepali Army’s Pavilion adjoining Khula Manch, which is not open for the public. Similarly,  Khula Manch is also not open for the general public anymore. More than two-thirds of the area is occupied by construction materials meant for different construction projects. The remaining area is used as bus park, leaving no space for the public.

Students studying at Tribhuvan University and its constituent colleges across the country will now receive refund amount up to Rs 90,000 spent in medical check-ups at government hospitals.
Student Welfare and Sports Directorate of TU has introduced the system of providing refund of up to 90 per cent of Rs 100,000 to students, on producing the medical bills of hospitals at the colleges. The money, however, will be provided only to cover hospital expenses such as various tests, lab charges, doctors’ charge and bed charge, excluding pharmaceutical drug expenses.
TU has also formed Student Health Check-up Fund for the purpose, which has now fixed deposit of over Rs 80 million, according to TU Registrar Dilli Ram Upreti. The fund was created by collecting Rs 500 from the admission fee charged from students.

This is not the first time TU has introduced the scheme. TU had, four years ago, introduced similar scheme to provide up to Rs 50,000 to students who sought medical treatment. Only around 200 students had taken benefit from the programme last year.
“This year we are circulating the notice to all colleges and informing students about the scheme, so that more students take advantage,” Upreti said.
To claim refund, students will have to write application to the colleges concerned. The colleges will then, after verifying the bill amount and student’s health condition, recommend the TU’s SSD to release the fund.
To get the refund, students  will have to undergo medical check-up only at TU’s Teaching Hospital, Maharajgunj; Gandaki Medical College Teaching Hospital, Pokhara; Dhaualagiri Zonal Hospital, Baglung; Surkhet Provincial Hospital, Surkhet; and Bheri Zonal Hospital, Nepalgunj.
Ganga Thapa, head of SSD, said they were working to increase the number of government hospitals where students could go for medical check-up.
“In case of diseases that  cannot be treated in the country, the SSD will provide  extra fund up to Rs 200,000 to facilitate students to go abroad for treatment,” Thapa said.
Students, however, will not be provided grant for dentistry, plastic surgery or for pregnancy. Similarly, students suffering from chronic diseases before joining the colleges will also not be granted any amount. TU currently has 62 constituent colleges.

Rama (name changed) gave birth to a child at her home one-and-a-half months ago. She never had enough money to visit a hospital for antenatal check-up during her pregnancy.
Almost 45 days later, she started to faint repeatedly. Her child too developed health problems. The mother and her child were then taken to a zonal hospital from where they were referred to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Kathmandu. Both the mother and the child tested positive for HIV recently. The mother and the child are still in the hospital receiving treatment.
Lack of awareness and education about HIV/AIDS, poverty, late diagnosis of HIV/AIDS and no antenatal check-up visits during pregnancy, delivery of child at home are some of the hurdles in prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV in Nepal, say health practitioners.
As per data provided by National Centre for AIDS and STD Control, a total of 267,321 women have tested positive for HIV during antenatal check-up and labour. From among the tests, 45 women have been tested positive with HIV. A total of 69 babies have received prophylaxis from January 2019 to July 2019.
Though the country aims to bring the number of mother-to-child transmission of HIV to zero by 2025, it seems to be a daunting task.
“If we are to decrease the number of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, all deliveries should be conducted in hospital and/or health facilities where HIV testing facilities are available,” said Dr Anup Bastola, consultant tropical medicine physician and HIV specialist at STIDH.
According to Nepal Demographic Health Survey, 57 per cent of births were delivered in health facilities. Eighty-four per cent of women who gave birth in the five years before the survey received antenatal care from a skilled health worker, a 25-per cent increase from 2011. Sixty-nine per cent of women had at least four antenatal care visits.
“If we are to decrease the number of mother-to-child HIV transmission, health education and health seeking behaviour is necessary. Poverty should be alleviated and education should be provided. Antenatal check-up is a must,” he said.
Madan Kumar Shrestha, senior public health administrator at National Centre for AIDS and STD Control, said, “We are extending HIV testing and counseling programmes. There are such counseling centres in 175 areas across the country. We are trying to extend it so that the number of mother-to-child transmission be prevented and brought to zero by 2025.”
Nepal has ensured that 31,020 people living with HIV have access to treatment through meeting the 90–90–90 targets by 2020.
By 2020, 90 per cent of all people living with HIV should know their status, 90 per cent of all people infected with HIV should receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy should have viral suppression.
A total of 29,944 people are estimated to be living with HIV in Nepal, according to NCASC.
Increasing the level of general knowledge about transmission of HIV from mother to child and reducing the risk of transmission using antiretroviral drugs are critical in reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV, according to NCASC.

The Government of Finland and UNICEF have expanded their partnership for children in Nepal through programmes in sectors such as education, water, sanitation and hygiene.
At a function organised in Kathmandu today, Ambassador of Finland to Nepal Pertti Anttinen and UNICEF representative in Nepal Elke Wisch, signed a partnership agreement for the next three years, committing eight million euros to enhance quality of services for children in Nepal.
While Nepal has achieved significant progress in people’s access to education, water and sanitation services in recent decades, it has not been able to ensure quality and inclusive education. Likewise, 71 per cent households relying on contaminated sources for drinking water has challenged the quality of WASH services.
The partnership will support a range of early childhood, basic formal education and adolescent non-formal education interventions with strong focus on improving quality, safety and inclusiveness, particularly for children from different background and for children with disabilities. WASH interventions will aim to provide universal access and water safety to the people of the remotest part of the country, read a joint press release issued by the embassy and UNICEF.
“The core goal of Finland’s development policy is to eradicate extreme poverty and to reduce poverty and inequality. Finland’s actions strive to promote and ensure the rights of children and the most vulnerable, notably the disabled, are taken account of in all our activities and women and girls are better educated and have better skills. Finland also strives to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. The country wants to support both the enabling environment and community-level work. It is crucial to reach the unreached and leave no one behind when it comes to education and water sanitation,” said Anttinen.
“The partnership with the Government of Finland will go a long way in bringing safe water and sanitation to the most marginalised communities and in creating an enabling environment to equip today’s children with knowledge and skills they will need to contribute to the development of their country,” said Wisch.

Visiting United States Assistant Secretary of Defence for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Randall Schriver today said the US accorded great importance to Nepal-US defence relationship and that the ties were on a good trajectory.

He said the defence relationship was built on the foundation of good political and diplomatic relationship of over seven decades. “I think the military cooperation is also a good foundation of bilateral relation and we are building from there,” he said, during an interaction with a selected group of journalists.
According to Schriver, besides strengthening bonds and deepening relationships, the US aspired to create a set of military and defence activities that promote Nepal’s own goals for its modernisation. “We want good relation with a purpose to promote Nepal’s own goals for its modernisation,” he said.
Schriver said the US’s vision for the Indo-Pacific region was that the region remained free and open as characterised by the fundamental principles and qualities such as respect for sovereignty, international law and norms, peaceful dispute resolution, and free, fair and reciprocal trade.
According to Schriver, the military-defence component of the Indo-Pacific strategy was enabling the countries to protect their sovereign interest. “Some of the trainings under this component helps the militaries to operate under civilian control and international legal environments,” Schriver said. “Our overall vision is to make Nepal strong, independent, sovereign, prosperous, and nothing more than that.”
On ongoing debate in Nepal regarding the IPS and Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact Programme, Schriver said the US welcomed the chance to hold discussion, explain from the US’s point of view, engage in a dialogue about what these principles were and why the US thought that other countries should build partnership with it. “The IPS goes beyond defence and there are economic, governance, and security components to it. The MCC is one of the major economic pillars of this approach,” Schriver said.
When asked if the suspicion in Nepal over the IPS is a result of meddling by other foreign powers, Schriver said the US’s competitors sometimes wanted to create narratives that the US was trying to force a choice or the US was trying to counter somebody else’s strategy.
“That’s not the case. If there’s a choice for the people of Nepal, then the choice is that you want to protect your sovereignty and you want to protect and promote international law and system. It’s not choice between capitals and countries, it’s a choice for standing up for these principles and values,” he said.
Schriver, yesterday, held meetings with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Ishwor Pokhrel, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Chief of Army Staff General Purna Chandra Thapa and Defence Secretary Reshmi Raj Pandey.
The discussions focused on various components related to US-Nepal military-defence ties such as security, assistance, training and exercise to strengthen the relationship.
Later in the day, Schriver visited Birendra Peace Operations Training Centre, Panchkhal, Kavre, to mark the opening ceremony of the new facility built under the US financial assistance. The US has invested $8.9 million in the centre.
Schriver said it was an important investment for the US because the benefit of helping Nepal with its peacekeeping training was great contributions to the United Nations’ peacekeeping missions.
“Nepal is already a part of global citizenry that makes major contributions with over 5,000 Nepali people currently deployed across at least 12 different missions. So it is something we proudly support. Not only the US but also the international community benefits from it,” he said.

British Gurkha Satyagraha has served an ultimatum until February 15 to the Government of Nepal and the British Government to form a high-level talks team and proceed dialogue for addressing the demands of ex-Gurkha servicemen.
BGS demanded to start a dialogue between the Government of Nepal and the British Government on the report of the Technical Committee that comprised ambassador of Nepal to UK, minister of defence (UK) and representatives of British Gurkha ex-servicemen’s association.
For that to happen, a dialogue on the report should be held with the International Relations Committee of the Federal Parliament of Nepal, as a guiding instrument, stated a press release issued by BGS today.
According to BGS, imposition of Indian Pay Code on British Gurkhas after 1948, which came in the name of Tripartite Agreement-1947, but with mutual understanding between India and Britain, was absolutely unfair, against the national sovereignty and independence of Nepal and contrary to the principles of right to self determination provided by international human rights laws; and was incompatible with other international laws including the Montevideo Treaty-1933, that defines the relations among the states and Article 2 of United Nations Charter.
It also warned that the movement of equality and dignity spearheaded by Gurkha veterans against the British government would be advanced in national as well as in international level in the form of patriotic movement and a campaign dedicated to human rights and dignity of Nepali people.
The ex-Gurkhas have demanded an end to injustice and discrimination against Gurkha veterans and their families, and compensation to the families of thousands of soldiers who had lost their lives in the past wars.

The government has geared up for the National Population Census-2021. Nepal has a tradition of holding census after every 10 years. The last census was conducted in 2011.
In response to a letter by the Central Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Federal Affairs issued a circular to all local levels to coordinate with the concerned district statistics offices for identification of training centres. “According to Section 23 of the National Census Operation and Management Order-2019, it requires the Central Bureau of Statistics to identify and designate the venues to provide training to the human resources to be assigned in census. Therefore, all local levels are requested to coordinate with district offices of CBS for necessary arrangement of government offices, schools and public buildings for the purpose of using them as training centres,” the circular read.
CBS has prepared draft of the training manual. It aims to conduct the national census in a reliable and systematic manner by maintaining coordination and collaboration among federal, provincial and local levels and other organisations for collection, processing, analysis, publication and distribution of data related to all individuals and households of Nepal. The NCOMO states that the national census shall be conducted by the CBS, which may establish census office at provincial, district and local levels as per necessity. One or more census offices may be established in a district or local level depending on its geographical condition and population density, it says.
The CBS shall also prepare questionnaire for the census. It will come into force after publication in the Nepal Gazette. Data are collected from each household by conducting direct interview according to the approved questionnaires. The CBS may authorise the concerned enumerators deployed in the field to use paper-based questionnaire or tablet/laptop or both, for data collection. Data or personal details of employees working in Nepali missions abroad will be collected through e-census.
According to CBS, it may request the employees working in the federal, provincial and local governments to mobilise adequate human resource for national census. “The CBS shall hire persons meeting prescribed qualifications as enumerators and supervisors, for door-to-door data collection and supervision. For this purpose, a public vacancy notice shall be published by serving a deadline of 10 days for submission of applications. If adequate number of enumerators and supervisors could not be hired through the public vacancy notice, the CBS may depute the government employees for data collection and supervision,” it said.

Representatives of the Nepal Bar Association today met Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Upendra Yadav and urged him to expedite the process of amending the Judicial Council Act to bar JC members from becoming judges.
NBA move comes hot on the heels of former JC member Padam Prasad Baidik’s bid to win nomination for Supreme Court justice. He had resigned from the JC yesterday hoping to be nominated as Supreme Court justice, but members of the JC could not agree on his name yesterday.
According to General Secretary of NBA Lilamani Paudel, DPM Yadav told NBA representatives that he opposed the proposal to nominate Baidik as SC justice yesterday, but since his name was recommended by a powerful person, he might not be able to stop his nomination in the next meeting.
Paudel said the NBA wanted to amend the JC Act as in the last seven-eight years, JC had recommended people with minimum qualification for judges.  “Only people with extraordinary qualification and clean image should be appointed as judges. Candidates should be known for their integrity, but the JC has been indulging in nepotism and favouritism while nominating judges,” said Paudel.
He added, “The JC Act should be amended to ensure that once somebody serves as a member of JC, s/he should not be allowed to become a judge or practice law.”
He said nominating JC members as judges went against the principle of natural justice. “How can a person who nominated judges in
the past create an environment for himself to be nominated for SC justice?” Paudel wondered.
Paudel said the NBA had been trying for the past one year to secure amendment to the JC Act, but Cabinet reshuffle had adversely impacted its bid to amend the act. “After repeated attempts we had convinced former minister of law, justice and parliamentary affairs Bhanu Bhakta Dhakal about the need to amend the JC Act, but after the Cabinet reshuffle Upendra Yadav has become new law minister. I do not know how long will it take for the NBA to convince him for the amendment,” Paudel added.
He said Yadav believed that those who had served as JC members should not be appointed as judges.
Yadav could not be contacted for his comments.
Senior Advocate Chandra Kanta Gyawali said independence of judiciary could only be maintained if the structure of the JC, where executive was in a position to maintain its majority, was changed. “The executive has its majority in the JC. Of the five JC members, three — minister of law, justice and parliamentary affairs, a member nominated by the prime minister and a member nominated by the NBA — can be easily influenced by the executive,” Gyawali said. He added that the JC should be able to make appointments fairly. “If judges are not appointed purely on the basis of merit, we cannot expect them to play an impartial and neutral role while adjudicating cases,” he argued.

Hundreds of participants at a programme held to mark the ‘16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence’ were left speechless after 23-years old Puja Karki (name changed) shared her ordeal of how she became a multiple rape victim, firstly at the hands of her grandfather at the age of nine and later by her father since her 14th birthday, until she tuned 17.
Nine-year-old Puja was at first delighted that she could sleep with her grandfather on a cold winter night, until the grandfather started taking off his clothes and asked her to strip as well. Puja thought ‘maybe it was his way of loving her but refused to strip’. Puja was then forced to submit herself — her dress was torn and her hands and legs tied with her own clothes — and raped, her inner parts left in a pool of blood.
After her mother found out about the incident she forced the girl into hiding it. The old man raped her two more times within a few months.
Puja’s father used to live abroad at that time. A few years after he returned, he totally ignored the girl and didn’t want to hear her story.
Until one day on her 14th birthday, when the father asked Puja to remove her under garments to show proof that she was really raped by her grandfather, Puja could not do so. Her drunk father then thrashed her banging her against the wall, kicked her several times with his army boots, stripped her clothes, stripped himself, tied her with a rope and muffled her mouth and raped her. “He then raped me whenever he wished for the next two years. Only god or I know how I spent those two years,” Puja said sobbing.

More than 200 participants of the ‘Stand Against Rape’ panel discussion held today were moved by the terror of the crime as Puja shared her story in a shaky voice for over 30 minutes from behind the curtain, her appearance veiled in a bid to respect her right to privacy.
Puja, who had six years ago tried to take her life by consuming poison, now wishes to become a gynaecologist. She has been mustering strength as her father is now serving an 18-year jail sentence following court’s order and her grandfather killed himself after she was rescued by the police.
“I wish to change my pain into power,” she said, as she was coming to the end her story. “I need your help for that, as it is still not easy to live with the same persons who raped me for years.” Puja is a representative figure among six girls and women who officially complained about being raped on a daily basis to the police.
Stakeholders and activists in the panel discussion today said it was now time to speak on every aspect about violence against women.
Bandana Rana, vice-chair at the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, said all government, non-governmental bodies, private companies, individuals and schools should be brought under a system which should seriously start to work to address the burning issue of violence against women.
Rana, who moderated today’s event, said, “The government should form plan and policies to secure rape victim’s dignity and their rehabilitation in society.”
Participants at the programme also criticised the police for lapses seen in investigation of rape cases.
Advocate Sonali Regmi said the police administration still had a mindset that rape victims must have bruises or their hymen should be ruptured as proof of rape. “Even police probe in many cases is not enough. If the police would only record the first information report as per the victim’s pledge, it would be easier to jail perpetrators,” she said.
Dr Sudha Sharma, a medical expert, said police must not always rely on medical report of any rape victim as proof might be lost until medical check-up.

Article 30 (1) of the constitution of Nepal enshrines ‘clean environment’ as a fundamental right, and states that every citizen shall have the right to live in a clean and healthy environment.
Article 30 (2) of the constitution also encourages the government to formulate necessary legal frameworks to balance environment and development.

The procedure aims to expand greenery promotion and pollution control programmes in community and institutional schools of all seven provinces so as to develop the culture of sanitation. It envisages activating persons, families and communities for environment protection by creating awareness from the school level. According to the procedure, the school-centric environment protection programme will be conducted in 50 places of all the provinces in a proportional manner.
The department invites proposals from schools and selects 50 of them on the basis of the annual budget and programme. “At least eight schools will be selected from Province 3 while seven schools selected on merit basis will be included from each of the other provinces. Priority will be accorded to such schools where such a programme was not conducted before,” the procedure says.
It requires the department to give the subject of environment higher priority in the schools. The department shall enter into an agreement with the selected schools for operation of the programme.
A seven-member committee led by deputy director general of the department shall select the schools and carry out evaluation and monitoring of the programme which will last for one year.
The concerned schools are required to submit bills to the department for reimbursement after completion of the programme.

The PMO’s initiative follows close on the heels of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s direction to the bodies concerned to enhance the condition of roads inside the valley in the next four months.
Joint Secretary Yam Lal Bhusal, also spokesperson for the PMO, said the office had formed a taskforce in coordination with officials of various ministries, departments, other government bodies and traffic police to undertake the task as per the PM’s direction.
“We often hear lack of coordination among government bodies blamed for the sluggish road construction. Keeping this in mind, the new team under the PMO will help improve the communication among government bodies for carrying out the task,” Bhusal said. He added that the taskforce comprises staffers of various government bodies such as Department of Road, local governments, Department of Transport Management, Nepal Electricity Authority and Nepal Water Supply Corporation.

The Office of the Prime Minister is also mulling formation of an another team, which will keep track of the roads inside the valley and identify if any part of the roads need mending, filling of pot holes or upgradation. The vigilance team will have officials from DoA, DoTM and Traffic Police.
“The second team will go to the field and suggest to the rapid task force if roads are in need of repair,” Bhusal said. Both the teams will be led by officials of the PMO.
Bhusal also said that the PMO would work together with the traffic police to promptly manage traffic flow in the capital city.

Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli was discharged from Manmohan Cardiothoracic Vascular and Transplant Centre after 10 days of treatment at around 3:00pm today.
Oli was admitted to the hospital on November 26 and underwent appendicitis surgery the same day.
Talking briefly to mediapersons upon his discharge, Oli said he was returning home as his health had improved. “Everything is fine as you can see,” he said.
Although his health was critical in the initial days after surgery, doctors involved in his treatment said the PM’s health had shown considerable improvement.
Dr Ramesh Singh Bhandari, who led the surgery conducted on Oli, said the PM’s surgery wound had almost been healed and he had been advised rest for the next few days.
“The PM has been prescribed soft diet and rest and should refrain from exerting himself,” said Bhandari.
Hospital Chief Dr Uttam Krishna Shrestha said since this was transitional phase after surgery, the PM had been advised not to engage in activities that would require physical effort.
Since the prime minister is also a kidney patient, he will be requiring dialysis on a regular basis. The PM’s Press Adviser Surya Thapa said Oli would undergo dialysis as and when required as per the doctors’ suggestions. “For now, he is recovering fast from surgery,” said Thapa. “Treatment related to kidney will be carried forward after he completely recovers from surgery.”
Thapa added that since Oli had been advised rest for the next few days, he would conduct his day-to-day work from his official residence in Baluwatar until he recovered completely.
The PM had undergone appendicitis surgery on Tuesday in the hospital after his appendix burst.

Nepali humanitarian and Red Cross Red Crescent veteran, Jagan Chapagain, has been selected as the new secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Chapagain was selected during an extraordinary meeting of the IFRC governing board in Geneva yesterday. An engineer by training, he brings more than 25 years of experience within the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Most recently, Chapagain served in a series of senior IFRC roles, including as regional director for Asia Pacific, as chief of staff and as under secretary general for Programmes and Operations, a role that sees him guide all IFRC relief and development efforts around the world.
Announcing Chapagain’s selection, IFRC President Francesco Rocca said, “We are very excited to announce Jagan as our new secretary general. He brings a deep knowledge and understanding of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. He started his path in our movement as a volunteer and I am sure he will bring all his first-hand experience as added value to this position. He also has a strong vision for the role the IFRC can and must play, both within the Red Cross Red Crescent movement and as part of the broader humanitarian sector.”
Chapagain’s announcement comes at the end of a six-month open recruitment process that was led by Russell Reynolds Associates, together with an internal selection committee. Chapagain will begin his four-year mandate on 1 February 2020. He will replace current Secretary General Elhadj As Sy, read a press release issued by IFRC.
“Let me also take this opportunity to thank him for his great commitment to humanity and his immeasurable dedication to our organisation and to the millions of people we serve. I am sure our paths will come across again soon. Once part of the Red Cross Red Crescent family, he will be part of it forever,” said Rocca. The IFRC is the world’s largest humanitarian network, comprising 190 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, 13.7 million volunteers and 160,000 local branches, working in local communities to save lives and promote dignity around the world.

A group of locals, whose land will be acquired by Budhi Gandaki Hydropower Project, protested at Maitighar Mandala today, demanding fair price of their property.
Locals protested after the district administration offices of Gorkha and Dhading published notices yesterday fixing the minimum price of the land plots in Arughat, Khahare and Arukhet that will be acquired for the hydel project. One municipality and four rural municipalities of Dhading and four rural municipalities of Gorkha lie in the catchment area of the 1200 MW Budhi Gandaki Hydropower Project. According to Information Officer of the project Ritesh Rawal, 3,560 households will be affected by the project.
Dharmendra Kaji Shrestha, who led the protest told THT that the government fixed minimum compensation of Rs 800,000 per ropani for those land plots that were sold at the same rate a decade ago. “We have enough evidence to prove the price of the land plots sold 10 years ago. How can we expect the unfair price?” Shrestha questioned, adding that the locals, who would be affected by the minimum compensation price were preparing to move the court. He said the DAOs also published notice fixing the price at Rs 50,000 for per ropani in some areas, which were a bit further from the motorable road. “The government fixed the price of our land in an arbitrary manner. It should have taken into account of the infrastructure and amenities in those areas before fixing the minimum price of land plots for acquisition,” he added.

Coordinator of Budhi Gandaki Hydropower Project Krishna Bahadur Karki told THT that compensation price was fixed by a committee headed by CDOs of Dhading and Gorkha district after completion of multiple layers of processes and thus it was fair. “The committee that fixed the acquisition price took into account the price recommended by the local levels, price of land plots determined by banks during disbursement of loans and price of land plots fixed by Land Revenue Offices of Dhading and Gorkha,” he said and added that 1,200 households, whose houses will submerge, will get compensation for their houses as per the current value.
“Affected families will be compensated for their houses at current market price. This means even if they had built their houses 50 years ago, they will get the price of their houses as per the current market price,” he said and added that the families who would lose their houses would also get residential plots at different locations.

TIRANA/THUMANE: At least 13 people were killed when the most powerful earthquake to hit Albania in decades shook the capital Tirana and the country’s west and north on Tuesday, tearing down buildings and burying residents under rubble.
Residents, some carrying babies, fled apartment buildings in Tirana and the western port of Durres after the 6.4 magnitude quake struck shortly before 4 a.m. (0300 GMT).
In the northern town of Thumane, Marjana Gjoka, 48, was sleeping in her apartment on the fourth floor of a five-storey building when the quake shattered the top floors.
“The roof collapsed on our head and I don’t know how we escaped. God helped us,” said Gjoka, whose three-year-old niece was among four people in the apartment when the quake struck.
The quake was centred 30 km (19 miles) west of Tirana, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said, and was also felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia.
Hours later a magnitude 5.4 earthquake hit Bosnia, with an epicentre 75 km (45 miles) south of Sarajevo, monitors said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
Five people were found dead in the rubble of apartment buildings in the northern Albanian town of Thumane and a man died in the town of Kurbin after jumping out of a building, a Defence Ministry spokeswoman said.
Seven bodies were pulled from collapsed buildings in Durres, the main port and tourism destination, the Defence Ministry said, adding 39 had been pulled out alive from under the ruins.
Defence Minister Olta Xhacka said 135 people were injured.
Firefighters, police and civilians were removing the debris from collapsed buildings in Thumane. Most of the buildings that collapsed were built of bricks, a Reuters reporter said.
Rescuers in Thumane used a mechanical digger to claw at collapsed masonry and remove a tangle of metal and cables. Others groped with bare hands to clear rubble.
Two people were pulled from rubble in Thumane four hours after the quake, a Reuters reporter said. Doctors said they were in a bad condition.
“Everything at home kept falling down,” Refik, a Tirana resident, said of the impact on his sixth-floor apartment.
“We were awake because of the previous quakes, but the last one shook us around,” he told Reuters, referring to smaller tremors recorded in the hour before the main quake.
Rescuers told local media one of the dead was an elderly woman who saved her grandson by cradling him with her body.
TRAPPED
Xhacka said the quake’s epicentre was in Durres. It was followed by 100 aftershocks.
“Durres and Thumane are the areas worst hit. Rescue-and-save work continues in the collapsed buildings there,” she said as troops pulled a victim from a hotel in Durres.
At least 135 people were injured, with 72 hospitalized, Xhacka said. Two planes from fellow NATO-member Romania were expected to land with specialized search and rescue equipment and help was coming from Italy and Turkey, Xhacka said.
Greece had sent emergency services for search and rescue operations, its premier’s office said.
“Firefighters and army staff are helping residents under the rubble”, in Durres and Thumane, the Defence Ministry said.
An unidentified man, with a wound dressing on his right cheek, told News24 TV his daughter and niece were among those trapped in a collapsed apartment building in Durres.
“I talked with my daughter and niece on the phone. They said they are well and are waiting for the rescue. Could not talk to my wife. There are other families, but I could not talk to them,” the man said.
Located along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, between Greece and Macedonia, Albania experiences regular seismic activity.
An earthquake of 5.6 magnitude shook the country on Sept. 21, damaging around 500 houses and destroying some. The Defence Ministry had said it was the most powerful quake in Albania in the last 30 years.
The images of collapsed buildings in urban areas suggested Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than one in 1979 which razed a neighbourhood of a northern town. Neither of those two earlier earthquakes caused fatalities.
The Balkan nation is the poorest country in Europe, with an average income of less than a third of the European Union average, according to Eurostat data.

SYDNEY: Firefighters battled hundreds of bushfires across Australia on Thursday as scores of blazes sprang up in new locations, triggering warnings that it was too late for some residents to evacuate.
As Thick smoke blanketed the most populous city of Sydney for a third day, residents were urged to keep children indoors, stepping up pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to tackle climate change.
By early afternoon, dozens of fires were burning across the southeastern state of Victoria and temperatures of 40.9 Celsius (105.6 F) in Melbourne, its capital, matched the hottest day on record in 1894, Australia‘s weather bureau said.
Authorities warned residents of towns about 50 km (31 miles) north of Ballarat, the state’s third largest city, that it was too late for them to evacuate safely.
“You are in danger, act now to protect yourself,” fire authorities said in an alert. “It is too late to leave. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately.”
Blazes across several states have endangered thousands of people, killing at least four people this month, burning about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroying more than 400 homes.
The early arrival and severity of the fires in the southern hemisphere spring follows three years of drought that experts have linked to climate change and which have left bushland tinder-dry.
With 10 days remaining to the official start of summer, extreme temperatures and high winds have sparked wildfires in new areas, even as firefighters tracked the crisis across the mainland, the Northern Territory and the island of Tasmania.
In Victoria, power to more than 100,000 homes was knocked out amid lightning strikes and strong, gusty winds of more than 110 kph (68 mph) that knocked tree branches into power lines, ahead of a cool change expected to bring relief in the evening.
The extensive damage was likely to leave some customers without power through the night as utilities worked to restore networks and fix downed powerlines, a spokeswoman for power provider Ausnet said.
State authorities issued its first Code Red alert in a decade, signifying the worst possible bushfire conditions, warning that should a fire start it would be fast moving, unpredictable and probably uncontrollable.
In the state of New South Wales, strong winds blew smoke from 60 fires still burning over much of Sydney, shrouding the harbour city and its famous landmarks in thick smog.
The state imposed tough new water curbs in Sydney from Dec. 10, when a key dam is expected to be down to 45% capacity. Residents face fines if they use hoses to water their gardens and wash their cars.
CLIMATE POLITICS
The unrelenting conditions have sharpened attention on the climate change policies of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who rejected any link.
“Climate change is a global phenomenon, and we’re doing our bit as part of the response to climate change,” Morrison told ABC radio.
“To suggest that, with just 1.3% of global emissions, that Australia doing something differently – more or less – would have changed the fire outcome this season, I don’t think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all.”
Morrison’s conservative government has committed to the Paris Agreement for a cut in emissions from 26% to 28% by 2030, versus 2005 levels. Critics say current projections suggest it will miss that target and have urged remedial steps.

158,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/singapore-court-to-hear-legal-challenges-on-gay-sex-ban/,"KUALA LUMPUR: As a Singapore court prepares to hear a series of legal challenges to a law that bans gay sex, LGBT+ activists on Tuesday called for the “right” verdict to be delivered so similar reforms can be triggered across other parts of Asia.
Like many other former British colonies, Singapore has retained an old law that criminalises gay sex, which was scrapped by India in a landmark court ruling last year to give a boost to LGBT+ rights.
Empowered by the Indian ruling, three Singaporean activists have launched separate bids in a renewed push to decriminalise gay sex in the city-state, where a high court is due to begin hearing their cases on Wednesday.
“I think public opinion is pretty clear across religious and age segments that homosexuality should not be a criminal offence,” Johnson Ong Ming, who was among the trio, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Ong, a DJ also known as DJ Big Kid, was the first to launch the case in September last year. The former head of a LGBT+ rights charity and a retired doctor also filed similar lawsuits later.
“I have full confidence in our judicial system and I am hopeful that the court will come to the right decision … and overturn Section 377A,” Ong said by email.
The court has set aside six days in November for the legal challenges to be heard but it is unclear when the proceedings will wrap up.
Under Section 377A of Singapore’s Penal Code, a man found to have committed an act of “gross indecency” with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare. The law does not apply to homosexual acts between women.
Singapore has emerged as a modern nation since independence six decades ago but socially it remains conservative, partly due to sensitivities stemming from multi-religious groups among its 5.6 million population.
Previous legal challenges to overturn the ban have failed, although recent opinion polls indicated there has been growing support for gay rights.
Opposition to gay marriage had fallen to 60%, down from 74% in 2013, according to a poll of more than 4,000 people published in May by the Institute of Policy Studies, a Singapore think-tank.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong however has previously said that Singapore society “is not that liberal on these matters”.
The Singapore court cases are being closely watched by LGBT+ groups in some other parts of Asia that have maintained the colonial-era law, including in Myanmar and Malaysia.
“If the decision in Singapore goes our way, then it will boost our morale here in Malaysia,” said Numan Afifi, president of the LGBT+ advocacy Pelangi Campaign in Malaysia.
Aung Myo Min, executive director from the Yangon-based Equality Myanmar LGBT+ campaign group said both Singapore and Myanmar “should follow the example of India” and repeal the archaic law.
Gay sex is a crime in both countries, with those convicted facing sentences of up to 10 years in jail in Myanmar and 20 years in Malaysia.

159,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/at-least-40-killed-as-fresh-protests-engulf-iraq-3/,"BAGHDAD: At least 40 protesters were killed in Iraq on Friday when security forces used tear gas and an Iranian-backed militia opened fire to try to quell renewed demonstrations against corruption and economic hardship, security sources said.

A government intelligence officer and a member of the powerful Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia were killed in a clash with protesters in the southern city of Amara, police sources said.
More than 2,000 people were injured nationwide, according to medical sources and the Iraqi High Commission on Human Rights (IHCHR), as demonstrators vented frustration at political elites they say have failed to improve their lives after years of conflict.
“All we want are four things: jobs, water, electricity, and safety. That’s all we want,” said 16-year-old Ali Mohammed who had covered his face with a T-shirt to avoid inhaling tear gas, as chaotic scenes overwhelmed Baghdad‘s central Tahrir Square.
Sirens wailed and tear gas canisters landed amid groups of young protesters draped in Iraqi flags and chanting “with life and blood we defend you Iraq.”
The bloodshed is the second major bout of violence this month. A series of clashes two weeks ago between protesters and security forces left 157 people dead and over 6,000 wounded.
The unrest has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which lived through foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State (IS) insurgency between 2003 and 2017. It is the biggest challenge to security since IS was declared beaten.
On Friday, eight protesters were killed in Baghdad, the IHCHR said. At least five of them were protesters struck by tear gas canisters, security sources said.
In the south, at least nine protesters were killed when members of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) militia opened fire on protesters who tried to set fire to the group’s office in the city of Nasiriya, according to security sources.
Eight people were killed in Amara city, including six protesters, one AAH member and one intelligence officer, police sources said. Three protesters were killed in oil-rich Basra, one in Hilla, and one in Samawa, security sources said.
In Diwaniya city, twelve protesters died after being trapped in a burning building, morgue officials and police sources said.
The building, which housed the local offices of the Iran-backed Badr Organisation, was apparently torched by protesters unaware that others were already inside.
Interior Ministry spokesman Khalid al-Muhanna said at least 68 members of the security forces were injured.
The sometimes violent demonstrations erupted in Baghdad on October 1 and spread to southern cities.
They pose the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi since he took office just a year ago. Despite promising reforms and ordering a broad cabinet reshuffle, he has so far struggled to address the protesters’ discontent.
POVERTY, DESPITE OIL WEALTH
Despite the OPEC member country’s vast oil wealth, many Iraqis live in poverty, have limited access to clean water, electricity, basic healthcare or decent education as the country tries to recover from years of conflict and economic hardship.
Many Iraqis view the elite as subservient to one or other of Iraq’s two main allies, the United States and Iran. Many suspect these powers use Iraq to pursue their struggle for regional influence via proxies unconcerned with ordinary people’s needs.
“They hit us last night and again this morning. We don’t have any demands anymore, we want the government toppled,” said demonstrator Salah Mohammad.
“We want Iran to take its parties and leave, America to take its parties and leave, and let the Iraqi people decide.”
In Basra, Reuters footage showed protesters clashing with security forces who launched tear gas canisters and stun grenades and were met by rocks thrown at their vehicles. Young men carried the injured away, as protesters set police cars on fire.
An 8 pm curfew was imposed until further notice in the southern provinces of Basra, Muthanna, Wasit, Babel and Dhi Qar, after protesters torched offices of lawmakers, Shi’ite political parties and militia headquarters.
How the government and security forces handled Friday’s planned protests had been seen as a litmus test for the stability of the country with political leaders already on edge.
RAGE AGAINST THE ELITE
In a Thursday night address, Abdul Mahdi stressed that violence would not be tolerated and warned that any collapse of the government would drag Iraq into further turmoil.
Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who in recent weeks criticised the government’s handling of the protests, urged calm on all sides during his sermon on Friday.
In Baghdad, many demonstrators initially believed authorities would refrain from violence after security forces killed dozens of protesters earlier this month.
Hundreds tried throughout the day to march into the city’s fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies, when they were stopped by security forces.
By afternoon, the mood had shifted with thousands of angry protesters wrapped in Iraqi flags under pouring rain, chanting that they were peaceful and calling political leaders corrupt.
As clashes broke out, tuk-tuks carried the injured to hospitals. Medical sources told Reuters hundreds of people had been treated for injuries, most related to tear gas exposure.

AYODHYA: In the Indian town of Ayodhya, minority Muslims are feeling under siege as they await a Supreme Court ruling on a centuries-old religious dispute that has cast a shadow over their relations with the majority Hindu community.
After a tangle of legal cases, the Supreme Court in August decided to hear arguments every day in an effort to resolve the dispute over what should be built on the ruins of the 16th-century Babri Masjid, destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992.
The uproar over the mosque triggered some of India‘s deadliest riots, in which nearly 2,000 people, most of them Muslim, were killed.
The bloody controversy raised lingering questions about the role of religion in the officially secular country, and the place of Muslims in it.
Last month, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi finished the hearings and is expected to pronounce his verdict in the next couple of weeks.
Whichever way it goes, the decision is likely to have a significant impact on the fraught relationship between India‘s Hindus and Muslims, who constitute 14% of its 1.3 billion people.
While most Muslim religious leaders want the mosque to be rebuilt, Hindus say there is evidence there was a temple on the site before the mosque was built in 1528 by a commander of Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty.
Construction of a “grand temple” in Ayodhya has long been an election promise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won a second term with a landslide this year.
Fearing tension after the court decision, Mohammed Shahid, 48, the grandson of the mosque’s last Imam, or prayer leader, has decided to move his family away.
He has reason to be afraid.
Shahid’s father, Mohammed Shabir, was killed by a mob of Hindus who rampaged through Ayodhya before tearing down the mosque on Dec. 6, 1992.
“In 1992, we decided to stay put – a decision that we live to regret,” Shahid said, sitting in the courtyard of his run-down, two-storied house.
“Other than killing my father, they set ablaze our house and a sawmill, our only source of income.”
‘BAD ELEMENTS’
Shahid said he was glad that his grandfather, who had died in 1990, did not see the destruction of the mosque.
Unlike Shahid, Haji Mahboob Ahmad, a 66-year-old Muslim community leader who lives near the site, doesn’t plan to leave.
But he shares Shahid’s anxiety.
“We’re conscious of the fact that some bad elements can try to foment trouble by taking advantage of the situation and that’s why I’ve requested authorities to ensure the safety of Ayodhya’s Muslims,” Ahmad said.
Ahmad said India‘s founding fathers established it as a secular democracy, and it must remain that.
The day Shahid’s father was killed, Hindu Hajari Lal, 57, escaped death.
Lal was among the hundreds of Hindus who destroyed the mosque with shovels, hammers and their bare hands, bringing down its domes before the whole structure collapsed.
Unfortunately for Lal, part of the building fell on him, trapping him in the rubble with broken bones.
“Since that fateful day of 1992, the only objective of my life is to see a permanent temple on the site. I can die in peace if I get to see the temple,” Lal said.
‘ENDLESSLY WAITING’
For Hindus, Lal said, the site in Ayodhya was as sacred as Mecca is in Islam.
That’s because Lal and millions of other Hindus believe the mosque was built at the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities.
Lal helps to guide a steady stream of pilgrims who come to see a model of what they hope will become a new temple.
Visitors can also look at an open field of masonry, in pink sandstone, including piles of ornately carved columns. Concrete pillars and blocks for foundations are also ready.
“Once the court green-lights construction of the temple, we can quickly move these concrete blocks from the workshop to the temple site,” said Sharad Sharma, spokesman for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council.
Top politicians, including some cabinet ministers, regularly visit Ayodhya to pay their respect to Nritya Gopal Das, an influential monk and chairman of a trust committed to building the temple.
“I’m sure Modi ji is aware of the sentiments of millions of Hindus who have been endlessly waiting to see the Ram temple,” said Das, using an honorific for Modi.

Canada named top country for social entrepreneurs
United States suffers biggest fall amid political uncertainty
More youth interest in working for businesses that do good



LONDON: Canada was named the best country for business leaders seeking to tackle social problems in a global poll on Tuesday while the United States fell from top slot due to political uncertainty.
Australia came second in the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s second global survey on the best countries for social entrepreneurs, seeing the biggest gain of 24 places from the inaugural poll in 2016, while France came third.
Mexico came last, down 15 places from 2016, but the United States was the biggest loser, plunging to 32nd place from No. 1, with the poll of about 900 social enterprise experts pointing to difficulties with government policy and access to investment.
Francois Bonnici, head of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, said over the past three years there had been “some amazing gains and some ongoing challenges” for social entrepreneurs addressing issues from climate change to refugees.
“Governments are recognising that to meet their own agendas this is a group of citizens and entrepreneurs that actually want to improve society and the environment,” said Bonnici.
“But it has a slightly different flavour in each country and that government role is important (as it) can legitimise the sector in their country by creating these policies.”
Business entrepreneurs globally are increasingly setting their sights on social problems with ventures that can be a commercial success while addressing problems like unemployment, homelessness, mental health, knife crime and even loneliness.
For example in South Africa social enterprise Harambee has created a ‘dating service’ to match unemployed youth with employers, while in India Project Patradya is tackling the waste problem by employing Afghan refugee women to make edible bowls.
But with little data on which nations were encouraging the sector, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in partnership with Deutsche Bank, began a poll in 2016 which was repeated in 2019. Social entrepreneurs, academics, investors and support agencies in the world’s 45 biggest economies, as ranked by the World Bank, were asked their views. Iran and Saudi Arabia were dropped in 2019 as it was impossible to get the right sample.
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
The 2019 poll found most experts, 82%, said social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum in their countries – although this was down three percentage points from 2016.
Canada, Indonesia and South Africa were named as the top countries where social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum, while Mexico, the United States and China saw the biggest falls.
Despite this, more than half of respondents – 54% – said the public still did not understand what they did which was not helped by the lack of a global definition of social enterprise. Italians were most aware of their work and Poles the least.
“People are becoming aware that the whole notion of social entrepreneurship is not just kumbaya,” said former Bangladeshi-U.S. investment banker Durreen Shahnaz, founder of the first social stock exchange, Impact Investment Exchange (IIX).
“It really is about doing serious work and making sure that work is scalable … There are signs the industry is maturing.”
The rising interest of young people – under the age of 25 – was a new finding, with three in four experts saying more young people were interested in working in social enterprises.
Indonesian social entrepreneur Denica Flesch wanted a career where she had a direct impact in the fight against poverty so in 2016, aged 26, she founded SukkhaCitta, an online marketplace selling clothes made by female artisans in Indonesian villages. “Young people are really challenging the notion of work, and combining purpose and career in one place,” said Flesch.
“They’re more idealistic and want to do something that’s beyond just looking for money.”
Canada was named as the top country where young people were playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs, followed by Germany and France, as well as the top place for women leaders.
WOMEN TAKING A LEAD
“Culturally we are about diversity and inclusion at a national level. That’s our brand, so that is helpful for the environment for social enterprise,” said Marcia Nozick, founder and chief executive of Vancouver-based social enterprise EMBERS.
She said policies that encouraged governments to buy the services of social impact ventures had been vital in helping the growth of EMBERS, which finds flexible jobs for people in a deprived part of Vancouver.
Nozick said there were many female leaders because it was “about caring and relationships and that has always been at the forefront of what women have brought to the business sector”.
Women were also seen as playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs in Australia, Belgium, Sweden and Malaysia.
The United States was named the worst place for female social entrepreneurs – the same as in 2016 – while Argentina and China slumped the most in questions regarding women in the poll conducted online and by telephone between May 7 and July 30.
The biggest falls for the United States overall related to access to investment, selling to businesses and supportive government policy.
Attracting investment continued to be a challenge, according to 56% of experts, down two percentage points from 2016.
Bonnie Chiu, founder and chief executive of Lensational, a social enterprise that trains marginalised women as photographers, said there was more capital available to social entrepreneurs but they had to jump through hoops to get it.
“So much time is spent chasing these opportunities,” said Chiu, whose business is based in Britain and Hong Kong.
“Traditional businesses just need to prove that they are financially sound, traditional charities just need to prove that they are generating social impact – but social enterprises need to do both.”
But regardless of the problems getting political support, financing or selling to businesses, experts said there would always be a need for social entrepreneurs to address the world’s largest problems where markets or public policy had failed.
“The more our political leaders might struggle to solve the world’s most pressing problems, the more opportunity for social entrepreneurs to come up with solutions,” said Jude O’Reilly, a senior director at U.S. nonprofit the Skoll Foundation.

OTTAWA: Canadians began voting on Monday to determine whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept into office four years ago as a charismatic figure promising “sunny ways,” will remain in power after two major scandals.
Polls opened in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland, with voting set to end in the Pacific Coast province of British Columbia at 7 p.m. (0200 GMT on Tuesday).
Trudeau, 47, the Liberal Party leader, was endorsed by former Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama in the final stretch of the campaign and is viewed as one of the last remaining progressive leaders among the world’s major democracies.
But he was shaken during the campaign by a blackface scandal and has been dogged by criticism of his handling of a corruption case involving a major Canadian construction company. Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has also had to overcome a sense of fatigue with his government.
Trudeau, accompanied by his wife and three children, voted in Montreal on Monday after a marathon sprint campaigning across the country in the past four days.
His Liberals and the main opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer are in a neck-and-neck race, according to opinion polls.
“The truth is it’s a coin toss right now,” said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker.
A year ago, no one would have predicted that Trudeau risked being the first prime minister since the 1930s to secure a parliamentary majority and then fail to win a second term.
The latest opinion polls suggest he may narrowly avert that result and could return to office with a minority in the 338-seat House of Commons. That would still leave Trudeau in a weakened position and needing the support of left-leaning opposition parties to push through key pieces of legislation.
The Canadian dollar was trading at a new three-month high on Monday, where “domestic attention is squarely on the 43rd federal election today,” said Shaun Osborne, chief market strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
“After some noise around the vote, we think FX players will refocus attention on the Bank of Canada policy outlook, the Fed and international backdrop pretty quickly,” he said.
Despite Scheer’s dimpled smile, Trudeau’s main rival has proven to be a determined opponent.
“He can’t even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he’s always wearing a mask,” Scheer said during a debate. “Mr. Trudeau, you are a phony and you are a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country.”
In his bid to unseat Trudeau, Scheer is also promising to balance the federal budget and eliminate a “carbon tax” on fossil fuels. Scheer, 40, is running his first campaign as party leader after winning a bitter Conservative leadership fight in 2017.
BUMPY CAMPAIGN RIDE
The six-week official campaign period has been a rough and meandering ride with dirty tactics on both sides.
The liberal image of Trudeau, who has championed diversity as prime minister and whose father opened up the country to mass immigration, took a severe blow when pictures emerged early in the campaign of him wearing blackface in the early 1990s and in 2001.
Trudeau had already been wrestling with the fallout from accusations he pressured his justice minister to help shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc from corruption charges. In August, a top watchdog said Trudeau breached ethics rules.
Given the fact that neither of the front-runners could come away with a parliamentary majority, it is the smaller left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) or the separatist Bloc Quebecois that could end up holding the balance of power.
“I am a lifelong Liberal voter and I am stumped on this one, mostly because I am really concerned about a Conservative win and just trying to figure out how to vote strategically,” said Kristin Street, 33, a strategy manager at a computer games company, in Port Moody, British Columbia.
EKOS Research pollster Frank Graves said Liberals needed turnout to be similar to four years ago or otherwise the Conservatives may have an edge.
“We may well be waiting until the final vote tallies in British Columbia to see who will win on Monday,” Graves said.

163,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/indonesia-says-over-11500-have-fled-violence-hit-papuan-town/,"
JAKARTA: Indonesian authorities said on Thursday more than 11,500 people have been evacuated from the town of Wamena in the easternmost province of Papua since dozens died during clashes last month in the area.
Located on the western half of the island of New Guinea and long racked by a simmering separatist insurgency, Papua encompasses Indonesia’s two easternmost provinces and has a distinct ethnic Melanesian population.
There has been a spike in protests and unrest since late August after Papuan students in Surabaya, Indonesia’s second city on the island of Java, were taunted and attacked by a mob chanting racial epithets over accusations they had desecrated a national flag.
In some of the worst bloodshed in decades in Papua, 33 people died and scores were hurt during clashes in Wamena on Sept. 23.
Government offices and homes were burned down, and 250 cars and motorcycles destroyed, as indigenous Papuans and security forces clashed.
The government and some Papuan independence activists say 25 of the 33 who died there were migrants from elsewhere in the country.
Erizal, 42, a former resident of Wamena who had left, said his child and wife died during the unrest and he now felt too traumatised to consider returning to the town.
“I am in my village in Padang now, maybe I will not return back to Wamena,” he said by telephone from the Padang area on Sumatra island where he was originally from.
He said his shop had also been burnt down in the unrest.
Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 2 Indonesia‘s air force had flown 7,467 people out of Wamena on Hercules planes, while 4,179 people had left on commercial flights, said Harry Hikmat, an official at Indonesia‘s social ministry.
Ahmad Musthofa Kamal, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said the situation in Wamane was now stable and that shops and markets were open again.
A former Dutch colony, Papua was formally incorporated into Indonesia in 1969, after a disputed vote of about 1,025 hand-picked tribal leaders. The result of the plebiscite was overseen and endorsed by the United Nations.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has opened the door to holding talks with separatists in Papua, a departure from the stance of previous governments and some of his cabinet ministers.

164,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/hong-kong-police-fire-rubber-bullets-tear-gas-as-clashes-intensify/,"
HONG KONG: Hong Kong police fired water cannon, rubber bullets and round after round of tear gas at petrol-bomb and brick-throwing protesters on Sunday in some of the most widespread violence in more than three months of anti-government unrest.
Running battles in the Causeway Bay shopping district, Wan Chai bar area and the Admiralty district of central government offices followed a night of showdowns with police in the Chinese-ruled city after a peaceful pro-democracy rally turned ugly on the streets outside.
More protests are planned in the run-up to China’s Oct. 1 National Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.
Police also fired tear gas from the roof of the Legislative Council building, which activists trashed and daubed with graffiti weeks ago.
Protesters, many of them wearing their trademark black with face masks, took cover from the tear gas behind umbrellas and held their ground on Sunday, some throwing tear gas canisters back at police as a helicopter flew overhead.
They built barricades with trolleys and trash cans and other debris. One threw a petrol bomb at police in the Wan Chai metro station.
At least one petrol bomb landed in the grounds of central government offices where several windows were smashed.
Police, who traditionally raise placards warning of retaliation before firing tear gas or firing water cannon, made several arrests, grappling people to the tarmac. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.
The water cannon fired blue dye, which elsewhere in the world is used to make identification of offenders easier.
The government said that the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, will be out of town for China’s National Day, despite her having sent out invitations for celebrations at home.
Some shops closed ahead of expected demonstrations, while the MTR metro service shut stations, a move that has made it a target of violence in the past.
Protesters shouted anti-China slogans and called for their “five demands, not one less” of the government, including universal suffrage and the dropping of all charges against their arrested colleagues.
About 200 China supporters dressed in red T-shirts gathered on top of Victoria Peak, overlooking the harbour, at around midday. They sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted “I love China”.
Angela, a housewife in her 40s, a Chinese flag sticker plastered on her cheek, said the pro-democracy protesters were “thugs”.
“If the government takes violent action I don’t object,” she said. “We have tolerated enough. I think I have emotional problems because of the riots. Because it’s not safe to go out.”
CHANGE OF HEART
Lam, the focus of weeks of anti-government unrest, will leave for Beijing on Monday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic the following day.
Lam, who was trapped in an indoor stadium by street protests for hours this week after an “open dialogue” with the people, will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night overland, minimising the chances of a clash at the airport, a popular target of anti-government protests.
She had sent out invitations “requesting the pleasure of your company” at a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Tuesday.
It was not immediately clear why she had the change of heart but the government said Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung would stand in for her.
Arthur, 40, wearing glasses and a mask covering the lower half of his face, said Lam’s trip was expected.
“In these three months, Carrie Lam has not really cared about the protesters. She only cares about the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) or what we might call ‘her boss’,” he said. “I think Hong Kong is somehow at this moment the frontline between Western democracy and the dictatorship in China…. Hong Kong looks more and more like a police state.”
Police fired tear gas and water cannon on Saturday night to disperse protesters who threw petrol bombs and rocks, broke government office windows and blocked a key road near the local headquarters of China’s People’s Liberation Army.
Anti-government protesters have attacked the legislature, Beijing’s main Liaison Office, occupied the airport, thrown petrol bombs at police, vandalised metro stations and set street fires in the former British colony.
Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.
The protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.
China dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.
Protests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement. Rallies in support of the anti-government protesters were held in Australia’s largest cities, with the biggest in Sydney.
Many wore face masks to hide their identity and crowds yelled “stand with Hong Kong” and “fight for freedom”, while placards depicted Chinese President Xi Jinping with a cross marked across his face.

NEW YORK: Earth is in more hot water than ever before, and so are we, an expert United Nations climate panel warned in a grim new report Wednesday.
Sea levels are rising at an ever-faster rate as ice and snow shrink, and oceans are getting more acidic and losing oxygen, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report issued as world leaders met at the United Nations.
The agency warned that if steps aren’t taken to reduce emissions and slow global warming, seas will rise 3 feet by the end of the century, with many fewer fish, less snow and ice, stronger and wetter hurricanes and other, nastier weather systems.
“The oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble, and that means we’re all in big trouble, too,” said one of the report’s lead authors, Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “The changes are accelerating.”
The dire effects will be felt on both land and sea, harming people, plants, animals, food, societies, infrastructure and the global economy. In fact, the international team of scientists projected for the first time that some island nations will probably become uninhabitable.
The oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat from carbon pollution in the air, as well as much of the carbon dioxide itself. Earth’s snow and ice, called the cryosphere, are also being eroded.
“The world’s oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe,” said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a deputy assistant administrator for research at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The report found:
Seas are now rising at one-seventh of an inch (3.66 millimeters) a year, which is 2.5 times faster than the rate from 1900 to 1990.
The world’s oceans have already lost 1% to 3% of the oxygen in their upper levels since 1970 and will lose more as warming continues.
From 2006 to 2015, the ice melting from Greenland, Antarctica and the world’s mountain glaciers has accelerated. They are now losing 720 billion tons (653 billion metric tons) of ice a year.
Arctic June snow cover has shrunk more than half since 1967, down nearly 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).
Arctic sea ice in September, the annual low point, is down almost 13% per decade since 1979. This year’s low, reported Monday, tied for the second-lowest on record.
Marine animals are likely to decrease 15%, and catches by fisheries in general are expected to decline 21% to 24%, by the end of century because of climate change.
“Climate change is already irreversible,” French climate scientist Valérie Masson-Delmotte, a report lead author, said at a news conference in Monaco, where the document was released. “Due to the heat uptake in the ocean, we can’t go back.”
But many of the worst-case projections in the report can still be avoided, depending on how the world handles the emissions of heat-trapping gases, the report’s authors said.
The IPCC increased its projected end-of-century sea level rise in the worst-case scenario by nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) from its 2013 projections because of the increased recent melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.
The new report projects that, under the business-as-usual scenario for carbon emissions, seas by the end of the century will rise between 2 feet (61 centimeters) and 43 inches (110 centimeters), with a most likely rise of 33 inches (84 centimeters). This is slightly less than the traditional 1 meter (39 inches) that scientists often use.
And sea level will rise two to three times as much over the centuries to come if warming continues, so the world is looking at a “future that certainly looks completely different than what we currently have,” said report co-author Hans-Otto Portner, a German climate scientist.
The Nobel Prize-winning IPCC requires that its reports be unanimously approved. Because of that, its reports tend to show less sea level rise and smaller harm than other scientific studies, outside experts said.
“Like many of the past reports, this one is conservative in the projections, especially in how much ice can be lost in Greenland and Antarctica,” said NASA oceanographer Josh Willis, who studies Greenland ice melt and wasn’t part of the report.
Willis said people should be prepared for a rise in sea levels to be twice these IPCC projections.
The world’s warm water coral reefs will go extinct in some places and be dramatically different in others, the report said.
“We are already seeing the demise of the warm water coral reefs,” Portner said. “That is one of the strongest warning signals that we have available.”
Outside scientists praised the work but were disturbed by it.
“It is alarming to read such a thorough cataloging of all of the serious changes in the planet that we’re driving,” said Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler. “What’s particularly disturbing as a scientist is that virtually all of these changes were predicted years or decades ago.”
The report’s authors emphasized that it doesn’t doom Earth to this gloomy future.
“We indicate we have a choice. Whether we go into a grim future depends on the decisions that are being made,” Portner said.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump welcomed Australia’s prime minister on Friday for only the second state visit of his administration, signaling the close bond between the two allies as Washington takes on Beijing and Tehran.
Trump and Scott Morrison are expected to discuss security and trade, as China’s increasing assertiveness, especially in the energy-rich South China Sea, has raised concerns within the region and the United States.
The leaders are also set to release a plan on Friday aimed at securing the supply of rare earth minerals, as concerns grow that China, the world’s largest processor and producer of the minerals, could cut off shipments of the prized commodities.
Days before the visit, a sign draped across the Australian Embassy in Washington proclaimed “100 years of mateship” between the two countries. On Friday, Trump feted Morrison’s arrival at the White House’s South Lawn with a 19-gun salute and US Marine Band performances of each nation’s national anthems.
“It’s highly symbolic of where the relationship sits at the moment,” said Patrick Buchan, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting that Morrison’s state visit was second only to French President Emmanuel Macron’s last year.
“Australia played a very smart game with Trump,” he added, noting the country had avoiding directly criticizing him, unlike some European counterparts.
Trump got off to a smooth start with Morrison in May, congratulating him on his surprise election victory in a tweet noting there were “no greater friends” than the United States and Australia.
The two also met on the sidelines of the G20 in June, cementing warm ties that Trump did not enjoy with Morrison’s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. Trump berated Turnbull in February 2017 over a bilateral refugee agreement before abruptly ending their telephone conversation.
Australia also agreed last month to join a coalition to protect oil tankers and cargo ships from threats posed by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz after a series of attacks there that Washington has blamed on Tehran.
Australia has also banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , the world’s top provider of telecoms equipment, from its 5G network, something the Trump administration has struggled to persuade other allies to do. The United States says Huawei’s ties to Beijing make the network equipment it sells to telecoms firms a security risk.
Australian intelligence concluded China was responsible for a cyberattack on Australia’s parliament and its three largest political parties, Reuters reported on Monday.
Following an arrival ceremony, bilateral meetings, and a joint news conference, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will host a luncheon for Morrison to be followed by a state dinner at the White House.
SECURITY AND TRADE
During a visit to Sydney last month by Pompeo and US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the United States and Australia pledged to strengthen opposition to Chinese activities in the Pacific.
China has unnerved the region and angered the United States by installing military equipment and other facilities on artificial islands it has made in the disputed South China Sea.
The United States and its Western allies also worry that China is using foreign aid to secure greater influence over small Pacific countries that control vast swath of resource-rich ocean.
Australia, traditionally the major power in the South Pacific, has promised up to A$3 billion ($2 billion) in grants and loans to counter what Washington describes as China’s “payday loan diplomacy.”
But Morrison has pressed Trump to end his trade war with China, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.

BEIJING: China expressed anger on Tuesday after German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas met prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, saying that no foreign country had a right to interfere in China’s internal affairs.
Wong met Maas on Monday in Berlin at an event hosted by the German newspaper BILD.
After being held for around 24 hours at the Hong Kong airport on Sunday for allegedly breaching the terms of his bail, Wong arrived in Berlin late on Monday evening, where he said he would “continue his battle for free elections”.
The timing is especially awkward as German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Beijing last week. Hong Kong has been gripped by weeks of protests, initially against a now-shelved extradition bill and now focused more on securing greater freedoms for Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China was “extremely dissatisfied and resolutely opposed” to German allowing Wong to visit and to allow him to meet the German foreign minister.
“China has already lodged stern representations with the German side,” Hua told a daily news briefing.
Hong Kong is an internal affair and no foreign government, organisation or individual has a right to interfere, she added.
“Any plots to rely on foreigners to build oneself up or acts or words to split the country are doomed to failure.”
Hua said that during her trip last week, Merkel clearly said that she opposes violence and supports “one country, two systems”.
Hong Kong returned to Beijing from British rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
“We can’t help but ask, what is the purpose of the German side in allowing Joshua Wong to come to Germany at this time and to meet with minister Maas?”
China urges Germany to abide by its promises and avoid sending wrong messages to separatist Hong Kong forces, and urges Maas to abide by the basics of international law and act for the benefit of relations and not be a “damager” of the relationship, Hua added.
Interference by foreign parliaments in Hong Kong‘s matters is deeply regrettable, the leader of the Chinese-ruled city said earlier on Tuesday, adding that an escalation of violence cannot solve social issues in the city.
Carrie Lam was speaking after another weekend of sometimes violent clashes in the former British colony, with police firing tear gas to disperse protesters in cat-and-mouse skirmishes, at times smashing windows and starting street fires.
Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding the autonomy they had been promised. China denies accusations of meddling in the city.

SRINAGAR: India on Sunday imposed curfews in several parts of the contested Kashmir region, after clashes between security forces and Shi’ite Muslims taking part in a procession, officials and eyewitnesses said.
At least 12 locals and six troops were injured on Saturday evening, officials told Reuters, as the worshippers on the traditional mourning procession of Muharram clashed with troops trying to stop it.
Troops used tear gas and pellet guns on the crowd, which insisted on carrying on with the procession, one in a series held at this time of the year, and pelted stones at security forces, an Indian official who declined to named told Reuters.
“The clashes continued till late night during which the troops fired tear gas and pellets,” he added.
A spokeswoman for India‘s interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
“Reasonable restrictions are necessary for peace and protection of life,” India‘s national security adviser had said on Saturday, accusing Islamabad of trying to stoke violence in the region.
Kashmir, a mountainous Muslim-majority region claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been the site of frequent altercations between security forces and locals protesting against New Delhi’s decision to revoke special rights for the portion of the territory that it controls on Aug. 5.
The most recent clashes occurred in Rainawari and Badgam, two Shi’ite majority areas of Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir’s main city.
The five km (3 mile) procession route that passes through the city centre has been barricaded by armed troops wearing helmets and bullet proof vests.
On Sunday, police vans fitted with loud speakers announced curfew-like restrictions in Srinagar’s city center Lal Chowk and adjacent areas, according to two Reuters witnesses.
“People are advised to stay indoors and not venture out of their home,” the police announced.
Suhail Ahmed, a Rainawari resident, said that there have been frequent clashes in the area for last three to four days as troops have been trying to block the procession.
“We hear deafening sounds of tear gas being fired for last few evenings. We mostly stay indoors but the gas comes into our homes making it difficult to sleep,” Ahmed said.
Muharram is the first month of the year according to the Muslim lunar calendar, and traditionally processions are held for the first 10 days of the month to observe the death of Prophet Muhammad’s nephew Imam Hussein, killed in battle in 680.
Shi’ite Muslims typically intensify their expression of suffering on the Ashura day, that this year falls on Tuesday.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests so the Chinese-ruled city can move forward from a “highly vulnerable and dangerous” place and find solutions.
Her televised announcement came after Reuters reports on Friday and Monday revealing that Beijing had thwarted an earlier proposal from Lam to withdraw the bill and that she had said privately that she would resign if she could, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters.
“Lingering violence is damaging the very foundations of our society, especially the rule of law,” a sombre Lam said as she sat wearing a navy blue jacket and pink shirt with her hands folded on a desk in front of her.
The withdrawal, a key demand of protesters but just one of five, came after unrest that drove the former British colony to the edge of anarchy as the government repeatedly refused to back down – igniting pitched battles across the city of seven million, the arrests of more than 1,000 protesters, and leaving a society deeply divided.
Many are furious about perceived police brutality and the number of arrests – 1,183 at the latest count – and want an independent inquiry.
“The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,” Lam said.
“I pledge that the government will seriously follow up the recommendations of the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Council) report. From this month, I and my principal officials will reach out to the community to start a direct dialogue … we must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions.”
The protests began in March but snowballed in June and have since evolved into a push for greater democracy for the city which returned to China in 1997.
The bill would have allowed extraditions to mainland China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
It was not immediately clear if killing the bill would help end the unrest. The immediate reaction appeared sceptical and the real test will be how many people take to the streets.
Some lawmakers said the move should have come earlier.
“The damage has been done. The scars and wounds are still bleeding,” said pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo. “She thinks she can use a garden hose to put out a hill fire. That’s not going to be acceptable.”
WINNING OVER MODERATES?
In the voice recording obtained by Reuters, Lam said at a meeting last week that her room to find a political solution to the crisis was “very limited”, as authorities in Beijing now viewed the situation as a matter of national security.
Beijing’s apparent endorsement of the withdrawal of the bill comes after the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rule since he took power in 2012.
Others said the move was not enough.
“This won’t appease the protesters,” said Boris Chen, 37, who works in financial services. “In any kind of time, people will find something they can get angry about.”
Pro-Beijing lawmaker Cheung Kwok-kwan said Lam’s announcement was not a compromise to appease those promoting violence, but a bid to win over moderates in the protest camp.
“It was likely speaking to the so-called peaceful, rational, non-violent people who were unsatisfied with the government’s response before,” he said.
One woman, Pearl, 69, said the protests were no longer about the bill.
“Some of those guys may change their minds, maybe, but just a minority,” she said of the protesters. “Some of them just want to create trouble and they will continue to do so.”
“Too little, too late,” said Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014 pro-democracy protests which were the precursor to the current unrest, on his Facebook page.
Leung Yiu-ting, president of the Hong Kong Education University student union, said the timing was wrong.
“Until the five demands are met, I don’t think the protests and the social movement will stop,” he said.
The protesters’ other four demands are: the retraction of the word “riot” to describe rallies, the release of all arrested demonstrators, an independent inquiry into the police perceived brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to democratically choose their own leaders.
The chief executive’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill’s withdrawal.
Hong Kong‘s benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped after the report of the bill’s imminent withdrawal, trading up about 4%. The property index also jumped.
Lam had said before that the bill was “dead”, but she did not withdraw it.
CHINA’S WARNINGS
Hong Kong returned to China under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system, hence the anger at the extradition bill and perceived creeping influence by Beijing.
China denies it is meddling in Hong Kong‘s affairs but warned again on Tuesday that it would not sit idly by if the unrest threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.
China has regularly denounced the protests and warned about the impact on Hong Kong‘s economy.
Cathay Pacific Airways has been one of the biggest corporate casualties.
China’s aviation regulator demanded it suspend staff from flying over its airspace if they were involved in, or supported, the demonstrations. The airline has laid off at least 20 including pilots and cabin crew.
The airline on Wednesday announced the resignation of chairman John Slosar, following the departure of CEO Rupert Hogg last month.
The unrest has shown no sign of easing.
Riot police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray – both anti-riot weapons – to clear demonstrators from outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station, with one man taken out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, television footage showed.
The police, who have repeatedly denied using excessive force, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HONG KONG: Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw global attention to their fight for greater democracy for the Chinese-ruled city which is facing its biggest political crisis in decades.
Planes were taking off and landing, with delays, but trains were suspended and approach roads to the airport impassable as protesters erected barricades and overturned trolleys at the airport and in the nearby new town of Tung Chung.
Some passengers were forced to walk the last bit of their journey to the airport by foot, dragging their luggage behind them.
The MTR subway station in Tung Chung was closed and demonstrators smashed CCTV cameras and lamps with metal poles and dismantled station turnstiles. Police appeared to be running in all directions and made several arrests.
Chek Lap Kok, built around a tiny outlying island in the dying days of British colonial rule, is one of the world’s busiest and most efficient airports, reached by a series of bridges which were packed with traffic.
“If we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong,” said one 20-year-old protester, asking not to be named.
Black-clad demonstrators targeted the airport three weeks ago, jamming the terminal in sometimes violent clashes with police and prompting some flights to be cancelled or delayed.
Police said protesters hurled iron poles, bricks and rocks on to the railway track near the airport station and trespassed on the track. By early evening protesters in the immediate vicinity of the airport had left, but protesters in Tung Chung remained.
“We have no idea how to leave. We’re stuck,” a masked protester said, as others looked for buses and ferries to get back home.
Sunday’s demonstration comes after police and protesters clashed overnight in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to the territory when it was handed back to China in 1997.
China denies the charge of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.
Tourist numbers have plummeted in recent weeks and international trade fairs cancelled as the territory faces its first recession in a decade.
China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.
Several hundred demonstrators also gathered outside the British consulate in central Hong Kong, waving Union Jack flags and chanting “God save the Queen”.
SUBWAY VIOLENCE
Parts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway on Saturday, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas. Police said they arrested 63 people aged between 13 and 36.
Amnesty International said the metro violence should be investigated.
“Violence directed at police on Saturday is no excuse for officers to go on the rampage elsewhere,” it said.
The latest protests came on the fifth anniversary of China’s decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong.
The unrest began in mid-June, fuelled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.
But the turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy.
The unrest poses the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.
Protesters have called for a general strike on Monday, but it was not immediately clear who would take part.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of efforts to restore calm and that talks with non-violent protesters would provide “a way out” for the Chinese-ruled city.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied peacefully in torrential rain on Sunday in the eleventh week of what have been often violent demonstrations.
“I sincerely hope that this was the beginning of society returning to peace and staying away from violence,” Lam said.
“We will immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue. This dialogue, I hope, will be based on a mutual understanding and respect and find a way out for today’s Hong Kong.”
Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China for trial.
The unrest has been fuelled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place after Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.
Three people were wounded, one critically, in a knife attack by an unknown assailant near a “Lennon Wall” of colourful pro-protest messages in the city’s Tseung Kwan O district in the New Territories overnight, police said. One man was arrested.
The protests have prompted sharp reactions from Beijing, which has accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest in the territory. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighbouring Shenzhen.
Britain’s Foreign Office said it was extremely concerned about reports that a Hong Kong staff member had been detained in mainland China, but there was no immediate suggestion that there was any link to the protests.
Staff member Simon Cheng did not return to work on Aug. 9 after visiting the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen the previous day, Hong Kong news website HK01 reported. China’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment. Hong Kong police did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc also said on Monday they had dismantled a state-backed social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on the Twitter and Facebook actions, but defended the right of Chinese people to make their voices heard.
Further demonstrations are planned in the next few days, including by MTR subway workers on Wednesday, secondary school students on Thursday and accountants on Friday.
The protests are exacting a toll on the city’s economy and tourism, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.
Singapore universities have cancelled exchange programmes to Hong Kong after Singapore warned its citizens to defer travel there, news website Today reported.
Singapore’s foreign ministry said in an advisory last week large protests in Hong Kong had become unpredictable and could turn violent with little or no notice.
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS
Sunday’s protest turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and protesters could be seen on Sunday night urging others to go home peacefully.
Aside from seeking Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
“The bill is dead,” Lam told Tuesday’s news briefing. “There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns.”
Police have been criticised for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
Lam said the police watchdog had set up a task force to investigate complaints.
She said she hoped Hong Kong had “unique advantages in attracting overseas companies”, stressing the rule of law, but warned of the risk of pressure on the economy which shrank 0.4% in April-June from the previous quarter.
“The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half. Actually, I think the data in the first half has not fully reflected the seriousness of the problem,” she said.
China has put strong pressure on big companies in Hong Kong over the protests, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s departure was announced by Chinese state television and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in protests.
China’s State Council called on Monday for greater development of the southern city of Shenzhen and integration of its culture and economy with neighbouring Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong is gearing up for further protests this week after hundreds of thousands of anti-government demonstrators braved heavy rain to rally peacefully on Sunday, marking a change to what have often been violent clashes.
Sunday’s massive turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the Chinese-ruled city’s airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and on Sunday night protesters could be seen urging others to go home peacefully.
Police said on Monday that while Sunday’s demonstration was mostly peaceful, there were breaches of the peace in the evening when some protesters defaced public buildings and aimed laser beams at officers.
It was a far cry from the violent clashes between protesters and riot police throughout the summer, with activists storming the legislature and targeting China’s main Liaison Office in the city. The weekend was also noteworthy for a lack of tear gas use by police.
The protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. They have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China, including an independent judiciary, but many in the city believe Beijing has been eroding those freedoms.
Aside from Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
One protester, speaking at a “citizen’s press conference” on Monday, was asked what path the protests would take now, peaceful or violent.
“We have started our rallies very peacefully but after two and a half months it seems that the Hong Kong government has not responded to our five demands so one thing leads to another and it may cause escalation,” the speaker, named Wang, said.
“If you ask me, I personally hope there will be a quick resolution to this from the government so we don’t have to protest any more.”
On Sunday, protesters spilling out from Victoria Park, the designated rally area on Hong Kong island, streamed onto major thoroughfares towards the city’s financial centre, chanting for Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam to step down.
Police estimated the size of the crowd in Victoria Park at 128,000 at its peak, although that excludes the masses of umbrella-carrying demonstrators who packed the streets.
CHINESE FORCES ACROSS THE BORDER
The Hong Kong government said in a statement on Sunday night it was important to restore social order as soon as possible and that it would begin talks with the public and “rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down”.
The Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, attributed the change in the character of Sunday’s protest to the presence of Chinese paramilitary forces, which have been conducting exercises in Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong.
“This was widely seen as a stern warning to the violent elements in Hong Kong,” it said, adding that a backlash from Hong Kong residents over last week’s airport occupations was another factor.
The Chinese Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper warned again in an editorial on Monday that hostile foreign influences were inciting the protest movement. Beijing has accused some countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest.
US President Donald Trump hinted on Sunday that the White House would like to see Beijing resolve the protests before the world’s two largest economies could reach a trade deal.
“I would like to see Hong Kong worked out in a very humanitarian fashion,” Trump said. “I think it would be very good for the trade deal.”
Further demonstrations are planned in coming weeks, including protests planned by Christians and even an accountants’ group.
Police have come under criticism for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations, but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
The central government has sought to deepen integration between the mainland and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and nearby Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave which returned to China in 1999. The State Council called on Monday for greater development of the so-called Greater Bay Area and to enrich the “one country, two systems” policy.
China has also put strong pressure on big companies, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s sudden departure was announced by Chinese state television on Friday and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in the protests.
Shares in Cathay rose more than 2% early on Monday before paring gains to be down 0.6%. Jeffries analysts wrote in a note on Monday that it maintained its “buy” rating on Cathay and that it expected the company to remain profitable.

KATHMANDU: Nepal must make training and experience in high altitude climbing mandatory for all climbers on Mount Everest and other high peaks, a government panel said on Wednesday, following the deadliest climbing season in four years.
Eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the 8,850 metre (29,035 feet) mountain in May – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side.
The Nepali panel – made up of government officials, climbing experts and agencies representing the climbing community – was set up after climbers and guides criticised officials after the deaths for allowing anyone who paid $11,000 to climb Everest.
Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Everest, and mountain climbing is a key source of employment and income for the cash strapped nation.
But the numbers attempting the climb in May led to crowding in the so-called death zone, where there are very low oxygen levels. That put lives at risk as oxygen cylinders ran out while up to 100 people waited in the queue.
Nepal issued 381 permits for Everest for this year’s climbing season, which tends to culimate in May, when the daylight and weather is the most forgiving.
“Climbers to Sagarmatha and other 8,000 metre mountains must undergo basic and high altitude climbing training,” the panel said in a report submitted to the government, referring to the Nepali name of Mount Everest.
The report said those hoping to climb Everest must climb at least one Nepali peak above 6,500 metres before getting a permit. Climbers must also submit a certificate of good health and physical fitness, and be accompanied by a trained Nepali guide, it said.
Ghanshyam Upadhyaya, a senior Tourism Ministry official, said the recommendations would be implemented.
“The government will now make the required changes in laws and regulations guiding mountain climbing,” he told Reuters.
Mira Acharya, a member of the panel said “climbers died due to altitude sickness, heart attack, exhaustion or weaknesses and not due to traffic jams”.
She said the compulsory provision of guides for each climber was to discourage solo attempts which put lives at risk.
A reliable weather forecasting system should be in place and rope fixing should be done in time, giving enough space for the climbers to use a window of good weather to reach the summit, the report said.

HONG KONG: Flights leaving Hong Kong were disrupted for a second day on Tuesday, plunging the former British colony deeper into turmoil as its stockmarket fell to a seven-month low, and its leader said it had been pushed into a state of “panic and chaos”.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also urged Hong Kong to exercise restraint and investigate evidence of its forces firing tear gas at protesters in ways banned under international law.
Ten weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and protesters have roiled the Asian financial hub as thousands of residents chafe at a perceived erosion of freedoms and autonomy under Chinese rule.
China this week condemned some protesters for using dangerous tools to attack police, calling the clashes “sprouts of terrorism”. They present President Xi Jinping with one of his biggest challenges since he came to power in 2012.
Hong Kong legal experts say Beijing might be paving the way to use anti-terror laws to try to quell the demonstrations.
Check-in operations were suspended at 4.30 pm on Tuesday, a day after an unprecedented airport shutdown, as thousands of black-clad protesters jammed the terminal, chanting, singing and waving banners.
“Take a minute to look at our city, our home,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said, her voice cracking, at a news conference in the government headquarters complex, which is fortified behind 6-foot (1.8-m) -high water-filled barricades.
“Can we bear to push it into the abyss and see it smashed to pieces?”
The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed suspects’ extradition to mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy.
At the airport, thousands of protesters gathered in the arrivals hall, as well as some parts of departures, using luggage trolleys to blockade the doors to customs checkpoints.
Floors and walls were covered with missives penned by activists and other artwork. The scene was peaceful as knots of protesters spoke to travellers, explaining their aims.
“Sorry for the inconvenience, we are fighting for the future of our home,” read one protest banner at the airport.
“I think paralysing the airport will be effective in forcing Carrie Lam to respond to us … it can further pressure Hong Kong’s economy,” said Dorothy Cheng, 17.
Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997.
They want Lam to resign. She says she will stay.
“My responsibility goes beyond this particular range of protest,” she said, adding that violence had pushed the territory into a state of “panic and chaos”.
As she spoke, the benchmark Hang Seng index hit a seven-month low. It shed more than 2%, dragging down markets across Asia.
Lam did not respond to questions at a press briefing to clarify if she had the power to withdraw the extradition bill and satisfy a key demand made by the protesters, or if she needed Beijing’s approval.
AIRPORT DISRUPTED
Airport authorities had earlier suspended check-in operations as the fifth day of a sit-in by protesters grew increasingly heated. Crowds continued to swell in the evening.
“Terminal operations at Hong Kong International Airport have been seriously disrupted as a result of the public assembly,” the airport authority said.
Some passengers challenged protesters over the delays as tempers began to fray, while the demonstrators, using a Chinese term of encouragement, chanted, “Hong Kong people – add oil!”
Flag carrier Cathay Pacific warned: “There is potential for further flight disruptions at short notice.”
The airline, whose British heritage makes it a symbol of Hong Kong’s colonial past, is also in a political bind.
China’s civil aviation regulator demanded that the airline suspend staff who joined or backed the protests from flights in its airspace, pushing the carrier’s shares past Monday’s 10-year low.
Other Chinese airlines have offered passengers wanting to avoid Hong Kong a free switch to nearby destinations, such as Guangzhou, Macau, Shenzhen or Zhuhai, with the disruption sending shares in Shenzhen Airport Co Ltd surging.
On Monday China said the protests had reached a critical juncture, after a weekend of street clashes in which both police and protesters appeared to toughen their resolve.
Police fired tear gas at the blackshirted crowds in districts on Hong Kong island, Kowloon and the New Territories.

HONG KONG/BEIJING: China’s aviation regulator on Friday demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend personnel who have engaged in illegal protests in the city from staffing flights into its airspace from August 10.
Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Last week, a Cathay pilot was among over 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.
On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said that Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website.
The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights.
Crew members that have not gained the authority’s approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations.
The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.
In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: “We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly.”
“The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific. There is zero tolerance for any inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour that may affect aviation safety. We deal with these incidents very seriously.”
Cathay said on Thursday it respects “everyone’s right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner,” while insisting it “recognises that Hong Kong SAR is a part of China”.
“We do not condone any activities that jeopardise the stability of Hong Kong,” it said.
On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights.
Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respects its staff’s opinions.
“We certainly wouldn’t dream of telling them what they have to think about something. They’re all adults, they’re all service professionals. We respect them greatly,” he said.
Global Times, published by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, ran news stories this week highlighting Cathay employees’ participation in the ongoing protests.
Embattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam on Friday urged an end to the violence, claiming that the protests are dragging on the city’s economy.
Hong Kong-listed Cathay is 45% owned by Swire Pacific and 22.7% held by Air China , according to Refinitiv Eikon.
The airline has been Hong Kong’s flag carrier since the colonial era. Swire Pacific’s parent, John Swire & Sons Ltd, is a UK-based conglomerate with businesses ranging from property to transportation.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Wednesday it would expel India’s ambassador and suspend bilateral trade with its arch-rival after New Delhi stripped its portion of the contested Kashmir region of special status.
Neighbours China and Pakistan, which both claim parts of the region, have voiced fierce opposition to India’s move dropping a constitutional provision that had allowed the country’s only Muslim-majority state to make its own laws.
Moin-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s newly-appointed ambassador to India, had yet to take up his post but will now not move to New Delhi, while Indian Ambassador Ajay Bisaria will be expelled, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a telephone interview with Pakistani TV channel ARY News.
“It is very obvious that our ambassador wouldn’t be in Delhi, and obviously the man who is here will also leave,” Qureshi said.
Earlier Pakistan’s National Security Committee, a panel of top government and military officials chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, said it would implement a range of measures over what it called India’s “illegal” decision to revoke Kashmir’s special status.
That includes “downgrading of diplomatic relations with India” and a further review of bilateral arrangements between the two countries, a committee statement said, without elaborating further.
Qureshi told Pakistan’s parliament on Wednesday the country was consulting with China regarding Kashmir and that he might fly to Beijing for discussions with officials there.
A spokesman for India’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ISLAMABAD/MUZAFFARABAD: Pakistan said on Tuesday it was considering further diplomatic and military pressure on India after the Hindu-majority nation stripped its portion of contested Kashmir of special status.
India on Monday dropped a constitutional provision for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which has long been a flashpoint in ties with neighbouring Pakistan, to make its own laws.
Nuclear arch-rivals India and Pakistan both claim Muslim-majority Kashmir in full but rule it in part. They have fought two wars over the territory and came close to a third this year after a car bomb set off by a Pakistan-based militant group killed dozens of Indian paramilitary police.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday India’s removal of special status for Kashmir, which included prohibiting outsiders from owning property, was an attempt to alter the demographics of the region and was illegal under international law.
“We will fight it at every forum. We’re thinking how we can take it to International Court (of Justice)… to the United Nations Security Council,” Khan said in an address to Pakistan’s parliament.
Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, accusing India of violating Security Council resolutions on Kashmir.
Qureshi is returning early from the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as a result of the crisis, the foreign ministry said.
India maintains its actions in Kashmir are legal both under domestic and international law.
Earlier on Tuesday, Pakistan’s army chief said the country’s military will “go to any extent” to support people in the region.
“Pakistan Army firmly stands by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end,” said General Qamar Javed Bajwa after meeting with top commanders in Rawalpindi.
“We are prepared and shall go to any extent to fulfil our obligations in this regard,” he added, without elaborating further.
BUSINESS SHUTDOWN
In Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir around 45km (28 miles) from the contested border between the neighbours, protests continued for a second day with hundreds of people including children shouting anti-India slogans.
In the Neelum Valley, which sits on the border and has seen heavy shelling between the two countries in recent weeks, there was a shutdown of shops and businesses in protest at India’s decision.
Many people in Kashmir have relatives on both sides of the border, but people on the Pakistani side say they have been unable to contact those in India for several days after New Delhi restricted internet and phone access.
Tanveer-ul-Islam migrated from India to Muzaffarabad in 1990. His family, including his elderly mother and siblings, live in the Badgam district of Indian Kashmir, but he said he has been unable to contact them for two days.
“My day does not begin until I speak to my mother, but I have not been able to talk to her (since) Aug 4. You can’t even imagine my pain,” he said. “We do not know about the well being of anyone across the divide”.
His wife Haleema Akhtar, whose family is in Magam in Indian-administered Kashmir, said she was also unable to contact them.
“I called my daughter and son-in-law in the US to try to contact them, but they too expressed helplessness in the face of the clampdown on communication,” she said.

HONG KONG: Police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong on Sunday after violent clashes a day earlier, and Beijing said it would not let the situation persist.
The Chinese-controlled city has been rocked by months of protests against a proposed bill to allow people to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China and they have now grown into calls for greater democracy.
A general strike aimed at bringing the city, an Asian financial hub, to a halt is planned for Monday.
After the peaceful demonstrations finished, hundreds of masked protesters blocked roads in the town of Tseung Kwan O in the New Territories, set up barricades and hurled hard objects, including bricks at a police station.
Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters after a separate rally in the island’s Western district where thousands of people gathered to urge authorities to listen to public demands.
Protesters had began a march towards China’s Liaison Office which has been a flashpoint at previous protests.
Police said the protesters were “participating in an unathorised assembly”, similar to Saturday when they fired multiple tear gas rounds in confrontations with black-clad activists in the Kowloon area.
Police said they had arrested more than 20 people for offences overnight including unlawful assembly and assault. The protests have become the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule 22 years ago after being governed by Britain since 1842. China’s official news agency Xinhua said on Sunday: “Central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue. We firmly believe that Hong Kong will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges ahead.”
During the day protesters had marched brandishing coloured leaflets, called for a mass strike across Hong Kong on Monday and shouted “Restore Hong Kong” and “Revolution of our time.”
“We’re trying to tell the government to (withdraw) the extradition bill and to police to stop the investigations and the violence,” said Gabriel Lee, a 21-year-old technology student.
Lee said what made him most angry was that the government was not responding to any of the protesters’ demands or examining the police violence.
What started as an angry response to the now suspended extradition bill, has expanded to demands for greater democracy and the resignation of leader Carrie Lam.
“Even if Carrie Lam resigns, its still not resolved. It’s all about the Communist Party, the Chinese government,” said Angie, a 24-year-old working for a non-government organisation.
Protesters on Saturday set fires in the streets, outside a police station and in rubbish bins, and blocked the entrance to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon peninsula.
Shops in the tourist and commercial area Nathan Road, normally packed on a Saturday, were shuttered including 7-11 convenience stores, jewellery chain Chow Tai Fook and watch brands Rolex and Tudor.
Thousands of civil servants joined in the anti-government protests on Friday for the first time since they started in June, defying a warning from authorities to remain politically neutral.
PROTEST TACTICS
The protests have adapted rapidly since the start of June with the movement spreading from the Admiralty area, where the legislative council is located, across to the whole city for the first time.
Previous protests have also targeted mainland visitors to try and make them understand the situation in what is officially termed a Special Administrative Region of China.
Young people have mostly been at the forefront of the protests, infuriated with broader problems including sky-high living costs and what they see as an unfair housing policy skewed towards the rich.
However, the demonstrations have seen people of all ages, including families and the elderly take part.
The protests mark the biggest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took office in 2012.
Hong Kong has been allowed to retain extensive freedoms, such as an independent judiciary but many residents see the extradition bill as the latest step in a relentless march toward mainland control.
Months of demonstrations are taking a growing toll on the city’s economy, as local shoppers and tourists avoid parts of one of the world’s most famous shopping destinations.
Matthew Wang, a 22-year-old marketing executive for a multinational corporation, said that the government was “encouraging people to become more radical to affect decision making because they are not addressing any of the demands.”

179,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/us-believes-osama-bin-ladens-son-hamza-is-dead-official/,"NEW YORK: The United States believes that Hamza bin Laden, a son of slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and himself a notable figure in the militant group, is dead, a US official said on Wednesday.
The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, provided no further details, including when Hamza died or where.
President Donald Trump earlier on Wednesday declined to comment after NBC News first reported the US assessment. Asked if he had intelligence that bin Laden’s son had been killed, Trump told reporters: “I don’t want to comment on it.”
Separately, the White House declined comment on whether any announcement was imminent.
Hamza, believed to be about 30 years old, was at his father’s side in Afghanistan before the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and spent time with him in Pakistan after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan pushed much of al Qaeda’s senior leadership there, according to the Brookings Institution.
Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces who raided his compound in Pakistan in 2011. Hamza was thought to be under house arrest in Iran at the time, and documents recovered from the compound indicated that aides had been trying to reunite him with his father.
The New York Times reported that the United States had a role in the operation that led to Hamza’s death, which it said took place in the past two years. Reuters could not immediately verify those details.
Still, the US government’s conclusion appears to be a recent one. In February, the State Department said it was offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading “to the identification or location in any country” of Hamza, calling him a key al Qaeda leader.
Introduced by al Qaeda’s chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio message in 2015, Hamza provided a younger voice for the group whose ageing leaders have struggled to inspire militants around the world galvanized by Islamic State, according to analysts.
Hamza has called for acts of terrorism in Western capitals and threatened to take revenge against the United States for his father’s killing, the US State Department said in 2017 when it designated him as a global terrorist.
He also threatened to target Americans abroad and urged tribal groups in Saudi Arabia to unite with Yemen’s al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to fight against Saudi Arabia, it said.
In March, Saudi Arabia announced it had stripped Hamza bin Laden of his citizenship, saying the decision was made by a royal order in November 2018.

KUALA LUMPUR: An undocumented domestic worker has the right to pursue her claim for unpaid wages in Malaysia, a court has ruled, setting a legal precedent migrant rights groups said would help protect human trafficking survivors.
In a landmark ruling this week, a high court in Malaysia said an Indonesian domestic worker who was not paid for nearly five years can pursue her case after it was dismissed earlier by labour authorities because she did not have a work permit.
“This is a precedent for all undocumented workers,” Glorene Das, executive director at the Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Tuesday.
“With this precedent, there is hope for undocumented workers to seek redress in court. They are workers who have been exploited in trafficked and forced labour situations,” she said by phone.
Malaysia relies heavily on foreign workers in areas such as manufacturing, domestic work and on plantations, hosting millions of migrant labourers from countries such as Indonesia, Nepal and Bangladesh.
But many of them are victims of human trafficking who were duped by brokers with promises of lucrative pay, often arriving without a valid work permit, and then suffer abuses later.
The Indonesian woman, who is in her 20s and whose name was withheld by Tenaganita for privacy reasons, fled to the group’s shelter in 2017. Tenaganita helped her file the legal case over unpaid wages.
She sought about 30,000 Malaysian ringgit ($7,300) in unpaid wages at the government’s labour department and then a labour court, but both rejected her case.
She lodged an appeal with a high court last year, which ruled on Monday that it was “premature” for the claim to be thrown out based on the work permit status, according to Tenaganita and the Malaysiakini news website.
The court also ordered the case to be fully heard.
“All I want is my wages that I have worked for, so that I can go home to my family,” the Indonesian woman said in a statement provided by Tenaganita.
The high court and the labour department could not be reached on Tuesday due to a public holiday.
Indonesia and Cambodia, key sources of migrant workers to Malaysia, have in the past temporarily banned their citizens from going to work in Malaysia as maids after cases of abuse.
Malaysia has said this year that it was ready to “declare war” on human trafficking and forced labour, with a review of labour laws was underway.
The U.S. State Department’s 2019 Trafficking in Persons report put Malaysia in its Tier 2 Watch List – the second-lowest ranking – for not meeting the minimum standards in efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

LONDON: Travelers faced a second day of travel disruptions in Britain on Friday after a heat wave gave way to thunderstorms, and technical problems at the air traffic control center grounded many flights at the country’s two main airports on one of the busiest days of the year.
A day after the country potentially recorded its hottest day ever, travelers at London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports faced delays after the UK’s air traffic controller, NATS, said it had identified a technical problem that was causing flight restrictions.
It was not clear if the matter was related to the hot weather or the ensuing thunderstorms.
“We are doing all we can to fix it as soon as possible,” NATS said in a statement.
Eurocontrol, the European air traffic body, said the technical problem is being caused by an “issue with radar displays” and hefty delays are expected for flights arriving at Heathrow and Gatwick for the rest of Friday.
This weekend is a big travel moment as families head off for their summer holidays now that schools have broken up for the academic year.
Britain, along with much of Western Europe, endured one of its hottest days ever on Thursday, potentially its hottest. The country’s weather service said a provisional temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.7 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded at Cambridge University Botanic Garden in eastern England, which if confirmed would be the highest ever recorded in the UK.
The existing record for the UK is 38.5 Celsius (101.3 Fahrenheit), was set in August 2003.
It said “quality control and analysis over the next few days” will determine whether the reading becomes official.
Rail commuters were also facing delays after the heat wave prompted Network Rail to impose speed restrictions in case the tracks buckled. Engineers from the company have been working to get the network back to normal after the track temperatures soared to up to 20 C (68 F) more than the air temperature.
“With the railway being made of metal and moving parts, the sustained high temperatures took their toll in places,” said Phil James of Network Rail. “Everything was done to keep trains moving where possible, and last night hundreds of staff were out fixing the damage and repairing the railway ready for today.”
Passengers using Eurostar services to and from Paris were also facing “severe disruption” due to overhead power line problems in the French capital, which on Thursday recorded its hottest day ever with the temperature rising to 42.6 C (108.7 F).
Authorities across Europe were looking to address the consequences of Thursday’s soaring temperatures, as records that had stood — in some cases for decades — fell.
Europeans and tourists alike jumped into fountains, lakes, rivers or the sea to escape a suffocating heat wave rising up from the Sahara. Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands — all places where air conditioning is not typically installed in homes, cafes or stores — strained under the heat.
In France, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner linked the country’s 60 drowning deaths so far this month indirectly to the current heat wave, warning that drownings are up 30% this month compared to last July.
Castaner noted a rise in people drowning in unguarded bodies of water as they seek relief from high temperatures, some of whom suffer thermal shock when they jump from hot air into cold water.
In Belgium, a 66-year-old woman died near her caravan close to the beach.
The woman was found by a neighbor late Thursday afternoon after she had apparently been basking in the blazing sun. The incident happened in Middelkerke on the Belgian coast as temperatures rose in the region to over 40 degrees Celsius. (104 Fahrenheit)
Middelkerke police commissioner Frank Delva told The Associated Press that the death is “very clearly linked to the heat.”
Emergency services rushed to the scene but could not resuscitate the woman.

182,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/food-for-trash-indias-first-garbage-cafe-to-offer-meals-for-plastic/,"NEW DELHI: Hungry, but don’t have cash? No problem, bring plastic waste and get a free meal, said the mayor of an Indian city where the country’s first “garbage cafe” will open next month.
The small restaurant in the eastern city of Ambikapur will provide hearty food to homeless and poor people and encourage citizens to keep their streets clean, said mayor Ajay Tirkey.
“Everybody is welcome to donate plastic. The cafe will be mainly run by women… Preparations are in full swing!” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Wednesday.
Single-use plastics are banned in many states, but Indians still generate 26,000 tonnes of plastic waste every day, according to government data. The waste is often dumped in streets, drains and landfills.
The Garbage Cafe, inspired by similar cafes that have opened in countries including Cambodia and Belgium, wants to change that.
In exchange for one kilogram (2.2 lb) of plastic, the cafe will serve a curry with rice, lentils, and papadams, said Tirkey, estimating that would take a couple of hours to collect.
For half that weight, punters will receive a breakfast of samosas, lentil doughnuts or stuffed flatbreads.
A waste management system set up in 2015 and run by women who go door-to-door collecting plastic for recycling, has helped make Ambikapur one of India’s cleanest cities.
The city built a road made entirely of plastic in 2015, India’s first and earns 1.2 million rupees ($17,400) a month selling plastic and recycled paper to private companies, according to Tirkey.
In a similar move earlier this year, a school in northeastern Assam state started providing free schooling to students in exchange for plastic waste.

SRIHARIKOTA/BENGALURU: India launched a rocket into space on Monday in an attempt to safely land a rover on the moon, the country’s most ambitious mission yet in the effort to establish itself as a low-cost space power.
If successful, the 10-billion-rupee ($146-million) mission will allow Indian scientists to carry out studies regarding the presence of water at the moon’s south pole, unexplored by any other nation before.
“This mission will offer new knowledge about the Moon,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a Twitter post, praising the scientists responsible for what he called a fully indigenous mission.
China, Russia and the United States are the only other nations to have sent missions to the moon.
A live broadcast showed images of the rocket, carrying the unmanned Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, blasting off from a space centre in southern India as thousands of onlookers cheered the launch, delayed for a week by a technical snag.
The boosters separated safely as the craft began its nearly 50-day journey, after which the lander will attempt a controlled landing to deploy a rover at the moon’s south pole.
The spacecraft had been successfully injected into the earth’s orbit, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said.
The next month and a half will see the spacecraft perform crucial maneuvers to ensure a smooth landing, ISRO Chairman K. Sivan said, as the agency’s officials congratulated each other with handshakes and bear hugs after the launch.
“We are going to experience 15 minutes of terror, to ensure that the landing is done safely near the south pole,” he told reporters, describing the final moments before the craft is expected to land on the moon, about 47 days from now.
The space agency has previously said the descent on the moon could be complex, with potential problems from variations in lunar gravity, terrain and dust having to be taken into account.
Globally, Chandrayaan-2, whose name means “moon vehicle” in Sanskrit, will be the year’s third bid at a moon landing, following China’s successful launch of a lunar probe and the Israeli Beresheet spacecraft, which failed and crashed on the moon in April.
India’s space agency suspects the south pole region of the moon contains water in the form of ice as well as craters that could reveal fossilized information about the early solar system.
Last week saw the 50th anniversary of humankind’s first steps on the moon in 1969.

CHENNAI: India’s space agency said it will launch a spacecraft to the south pole of the moon on Monday after stopping an attempt this week.
The Indian Space Research Organisation said the Chandrayaan-2 launch is now set at 2:43 p.m. on Monday. It said Thursday that the cause of the previous technical snag had been identified and corrected.
The earlier launch attempt on Monday was called off less than an hour before the 640-ton, 14-story rocket launcher lifted off.
Chandrayaan, the Sanskrit word for “moon craft,” is designed to land on the lunar south pole and send a rover to explore water deposits that were confirmed by a previous mission that orbited the moon.
Dr K Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, said that the around $140 million Chandrayaan-2 mission was the nation’s most prestigious to date, in part because of the technical complexities of landing on the lunar surface — an event he described as “15 terrifying minutes.”
If India did manage the landing, it would be only the fourth country to do so after the US, Russia and China.

ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: Pakistan re-opened its airspace to civil aviation on Tuesday following months of restrictions imposed after clashes with India, which forced lengthy detours that cost airlines millions of dollars.
“Pakistan airspace is open for all types of civil traffic on published ATS (Air Traffic Service) routes,” according to a so-called Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) published on the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority’s website shortly after midnight.
The decision by Pakistan, which lies along an important aviation corridor, offers a welcome break for international airlines.
The restrictions, imposed in February, affected hundreds of commercial and cargo flights each day, adding to flight time for passengers and fuel costs for airlines.
India’s ministry of civil aviation said that after the lifting of the NOTAMS, there were no further restrictions on airspace in either country.
“Flights have started using the closed air routes, bringing a significant relief for airlines,” it said.
Pakistan closed its airspace after an attack by a Pakistan-based militant group in Indian-controlled Kashmir led to an armed standoff between the nuclear-armed powers.
Both countries carried out aerial attacks over the other’s territory and warplanes fought a brief dogfight over the skies of the disputed Kashmir region during which an Indian fighter jet was shot down.
Partial operations at Pakistani airports resumed once the immediate crisis passed but restrictions continued to affect many international carriers using Pakistani airspace.
Flights between Europe and Southeast Asia were forced further south, adding as much as 450 km (280 miles) to some journeys and forcing the cancellation of some routes.
“Pakistan being open again makes the traditional and preferred Europe-Asia route through Afghanistan, Pakistan and onwards to India available again, and means that city pairs abandoned after the February shutdown will likely be restarted,” OPSGROUP, which provides guidance to operators, said in a note.
Indian operators were badly affected by the shutdown. An Air India spokesman said the company would take about a week to rework its schedule and come up with a plan to operate its flights over Pakistan.
Air India suffered losses of 4.91 billion rupees ($71.6 million), India’s aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri told lawmakers this month.
Interglobe Aviation Ltd controlled Indigo Airlines, India’s largest by market share, incurred a loss of 251 million rupees due to the closure of the Pakistani airspace, while Spicejet Ltd incurred losses of 307.3 million rupees, Puri said.
Representatives of Indigo and Spicejet did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment.
Pakistan’s announcement came hours after United Airlines Holdings Inc said it was extending the suspension of its flights from the United States to Delhi and Mumbai in India until Oct. 26, citing continued the Pakistani restriction.
The dropping of the restriction will allow Pakistan, which this month agreed to a $6 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund, to collect overflight fees from airlines.

Sanna Marin, 34 from the dominant Social Democrats, was nominated on Sunday. Centre Party chief Katri Kulmuni, 32, will get the finance post when the full new cabinet is announced this week, party members said.
Finland‘s government resigned last week after the Centre Party said it had lost confidence in Social Democrat Prime Minister Antti Rinne over his handling of a postal strike.
The five parties in power – four of them led by women – decided to stay in coalition and continue with the same programmes, but said there would be a reshuffle.
“We want to make the axis between the prime minister and the finance minister work,” Kulmuni said. “That is the foundation for this new generation of collaboration (between the Social Democrats and the Centre Party),” she added.
There was no immediate comment from Marin, the former transport minister.
She has had a swift rise in Finnish politics since becoming head of the city council of her industrial hometown of Tampere at the age of 27.
She will take over in the middle of a wave of strikes, which will halt production at some of Finland‘s largest companies from Monday. The Confederation of Finnish Industries estimates the strikes will cost the companies a combined 500 million euros ($550 million) in lost revenue.
Kulmuni, who previously held the more junior position of Minister of Economic Affairs, replaces Mika Lintila. She took over as the head of the Centre Party from ex-prime minister Juha Sipila in September.
Green Party leader Maria Ohisalo, 34, will continue as interior minister, the Left Alliance’s chairwoman Li Andersson, 32, as education minister and the Swedish People’s Party’s Anna-Maja Henriksson, 55, as justice minister.
Rinne will remain the Social Democrats leader at least until he chairs the party’s conference in June.

187,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australia-braces-for-more-fires-as-extreme-temperatures-predicted/,"SYDNEY: Thousands of firefighters were fortifying containment lines on Monday as temperatures were forecast to soar, increasing the danger of a fresh wave of bushfires across Australia‘s east coast.
More 100 fires remain ablaze in the region, and authorities warned conditions would worsen on Tuesday when temperatures were predicted to top 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).
Seeking to minimise the threat, firefighters safely burned grassland around homes to remove fuel, said NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.
“Firefighters are trying to take advantage of the more moderate conditions… and establish as many significant containment options as they can,” Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. “It is an enormous amount of work with more than 2,000 people out in the field.”
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Such fires are common in Australia‘s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring this year have caught many by surprise. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
In the small city of Hawkesbury, about 50 km (31.1 miles) north-west of Sydney, residents joined firefighters to safeguard their properties.
Mayor Barry Calvert said residents were trying to clear foliage from around their homes, and opening gates to ensure emergency workers have access.
Calvert said many locals were struggling to move animals and livestock in an area renowned for breeding racehorses.
“We’ve opened the showground for people to move their animals, but many people here may have 20 horses and only two horse boxes so they can’t move them quickly,” Calvert told Reuters.
The wildfires have blanketed Sydney – home to more the 5 million people – in smoke and ash for more than a week, turning the daytime sky orange, obscuring visibility and prompting commuters to wear breathing masks.
Australia‘s worst bushfires on record destroyed thousands of homes in Victoria state in February 2009, killing 173 people and injuring 414.

He said novelist Muna Chaudhary has step-by-step presented the economic exploitation imposed by society on people from marginalised communities and added that the author also cleverly uses Tharu terms and has described them in Nepali to make readers understand. Pandey, however, pointed out that readers would have to keep patience as the main plot unfolds very slowly as the story develops.

Likewise, sociologist Priyanka Kapar said the novel was equally suitable for people from different walks of life as it has touched on the reality of the present state of affairs in Tarai. She said the novel compelled her to recollect how Tharu people practised the ‘untouchability’ with various Dalit communities. She said she was impressed with the author’s way of addressing how women lose their names after getting married in Tarai. However, she pointed out that the novel lacks a historical background of the Musahar community.
Similarly, publishing team member Anbika Giri thanked author Chaudhary for her effort to write a novel on the isolated story. She said the story matches reality as it includes the conditions of people reeling under poverty in Tarai.
Novelist Muna Chaudhary said she found her aspiration to write the novel from her day-to-day experiences and her encouraging husband. She said the novel presents the story of a woman born in a Dalit community and the difficulties and challenges she faces due to limitation set against a marginalised community. The story is narrated from a woman’s perspective.

There were 96 fires burning in New South Wales, home to Australia’s largest city of Sydney, with only about a half contained and more than 1,600 firefighters deployed to do back burning and create containment lines.
Sydney with its population of 5.2 million has been blanketed by unhealthy haze and smoke for weeks, with conditions worsening on Friday as several fires merged into a giant blaze that may take weeks to put out.
Australia has been through some devastating bushfires before during its hot summers, but fire officials have said that this earlier-than-usual wave of fires has been one of the most persistent and largest.
NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told Australia’s ABC television on Sunday that temperatures will be raising to above normal by Tuesday, reaching 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), threatening the spread of the fires and new blazes.
More smoke is to be expected around Sydney on Sunday as firefighters will do preventive work.
“Crews are going to be actively out there lighting up large tracts of land, kilometres of trails and tracks, and getting into bushland areas in an attempt to bring those fires under control and start putting it into consolidation with containment lines,” Fitzsimmons said.
The fires have been blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson and with much of the country under a long-lasting drought, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been under pressure to address the impact of climate change.
In mid-November, 14 mayors of fire-stricken areas signed a letter urging the government to acknowledge a correlation between climate change and the devastating bushfires, asking also for more funds.
While some additional money has been provided, Morrison has repeatedly rejected any links between the fires and his conservative policies, including support for the coal industry.
On Saturday, the government issued a report suggesting that Australia is on track to meet its emission reduction target, which under the Paris Agreement calls for the country to reduce its emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2030.
The government acknowledged, however, that it uses so-called carryover credits, which allow for counting emissions reduction from the past towards future targets – a practice criticised by the European Union and Pacific countries threatened by climate change.

190,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/nobel-literature-winner-dreams-of-a-new-narrative-style/,"STOCKHOLM: Nobel Literature Prize winner Olga Tokarczuk says she thinks a new sort of fiction may be needed to counteract the modern era’s tendency to isolate and divide people.
In her Saturday lecture in Stockholm ahead of receiving the prize next week, the Polish author complained of the “exhausting white noise of oceans of information” in the internet era.

“It has turned out that we are not capable of bearing this enormity of information, which instead of uniting, generalizing and freeing, has differentiated, divided and enclosed us in individual little bubbles,” she said.
Tokarczuk suggested this discourages people from understanding how actions are interconnected, thus contributing to climate crisis and political tensions.
She said she dreams of a new kind of “fourth-person” narrator in fiction who could encompass the views of each character in a novel.
“We can regard this figure of a mysterious, tender narrator as miraculous and significant. This is a point of view, a perspective, from which everything can be seen. Seeing everything means recognizing the ultimate fact that all things that exist are mutually connected into a single whole, even if the connections between them are not yet known to us,” she said.
Tokarczuk is the 2018 literature laureate.  Her prize was announced only two months ago because the Swedish Academy postponed naming a winner last year due to internal turmoil connected with a sex abuse scandal.
The 2019 Nobel Literature winner, Peter Handke, has also brought controversy to the body because of widespread criticism of him as an apologist for Serbian war crimes during the 1990s. One Swedish Academy member said he is boycotting Nobel ceremonies this year in protest of Handke’s selection and a member of the literature nominating committee has announced his resignation.
Handke jousted with journalists who were questioning his views at a Friday news conference, saying he preferred receiving soiled toilet paper to answering their questions. But his lecture on Saturday was contemplative, telling how his writing was first inspired by religious litanies he heard from a village church. He concluded by reciting a poem by the late Swedish Nobel laureate Tomas Transtomer in which an angel whispers “do not be afraid of being human.”
The Nobel prizes in physics, chemistry, medicine, economics and literature are being presented Tuesday in the Swedish capital.
Earlier Saturday, several Nobel laureates in science spoke about climate change at their news conferences in Stockholm.
Didier Queloz, an astronomer who shares this year’s Nobel physics prize for discovering a planet outside the Earth’s solar system, said people who shrug off climate change on the grounds that humans will eventually leave for distant planets are wrong.
“The stars are so far away I think we should not have any serious hope to escape the Earth,” Queloz said. “We’re not built to survive on any other planet than this one … we’d better spend our time and energy trying to fix it.”

191,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/brick-kiln-workers-health-at-risk/,"Exposure to dust particles, smoke, carbondioxide has made them susceptible
Kathmandu, December 7 
A recent research conducted on 20 brick kilns of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur has revealed that brick kiln workers are at high risk of respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and asthma.
Among the 400 brick kiln workers, a total of 159 participants had suffered from flu one month prior to the survey. Meanwhile, 91 participants (22.8 per cent) had pneumonia.
The research conducted by Resource Centre for Primary Health Care revealed that 75.5 per cent participants were not aware of chronic diseases. The research also revealed that workers were susceptible to body aches and joint pain because they had to carry heavy loads.

“As brick kiln workers have to work with dust and smoke, they are likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses such as asthma, chronic cough, chronic bronchitis, and wheezing, said Dr Kedar Narsingh KC, chest physician.
Dust particles and carbon dioxide from the burning of bricks impacts the health of brick kiln workers and the public. “People are likely to suffer from bronchitis and asthma. Long-term exposure to such particles lead to hypertension, cardiac problems and cancer. Also, exposure to such particles lead to skin problems such as irritation of skin and allergies,” Dr KC added
“The research was conducted to know the health status of workers in brick kilns. It was also conducted to find information regarding occupational safety,” said Purna Duwal, a researcher.
From among the participants, 75.5 per cent did not know about chronic health impacts of dust and smoke.
Meanwhile, 61.8 per cent of the participants knew about the importance of wearing mask. “Though brick kiln workers were given masks to prevent exposure to dust particles and smoke, they did not use them as ordinary masks made breathing difficult,” said Duwal. The research team has recommended that special masks be provided to enable workers to breathe easily. It has also recommended that new tools and equipment be used in brick kilns to lessen the smoke and its health hazards.
The research also revealed that 69.5 per cent brick kiln workers had to spend their own money on treatment.
“Immediate action should be taken to reduce brick kiln workers’ exposure to smoke and dust,” said Dr KC.

192,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/samoa-says-almost-90-of-people-vaccinated-against-measles-after-deadly-outbreak/,"MELBOURNE: Samoa said on Saturday nearly 90% of eligible people had been vaccinated against measles as it lifted a two-day curfew imposed amid an outbreak that has killed 65 in recent weeks.
There were, however, 103 new cases of measles reported since Friday, Samoa‘s Health Ministry said it a statement.
The measles virus has infected almost 4,500 people in the South Pacific nation of just 200,000 since late October. Of those who died, 57 were children under the age of four.
The mandatory immunisation campaign aims to vaccinate 90% of the population, tripling Samoa‘s coverage in just a few weeks. The government said a rate of 89% had been achieved as of Friday.
Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as parents shun immunisation for philosophical or religious reasons, or fears, debunked by doctors, that such vaccines could cause autism.
Samoa and the United Nations appealed on Friday to the international community for about $10.7 million to battle and recover from the crisis.
“The impacts of this emergency will be far reaching on Samoa and our people, particularly our young generations,” Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said in a statement.
“It is imperative therefore to strengthen the culture of acceptance of vaccination in order to create ‘herd immunity’. This is a painful lesson we have learnt from the current crisis.”
New Zealand and a number of other countries and organisations, including the UN agency UNICEF, have delivered thousands of vaccines, medical supplies and have sent medical personnel to help with the outbreak.
The World Health Organisation said this week that measles infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children.
The picture for 2019 is even worse, it said, with provisional data up to November showing a three-fold increase in case numbers compared with the same period in 2018.

193,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/activists-cheer-for-greta-urge-climate-action-in-madrid/,"MADRID: Activists of all ages and from all corners of the planet demanded concrete action Friday against climate change from leaders and negotiators at a global summit in Madrid.
The march was led by dozens of representatives of Latin America’s indigenous peoples — a mark of deference after anti-government protests in Chile, the original host of the summit, resulted in the talks suddenly being moved to Europe for the third year in a row.

Celebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg declared from a stage that “change is not going to come from the people in power, it’s going to come from the masses.” A crowd of thousands responded chanting “Greta! Greta!”
Organisers claimed 500,000 people turned out for the march, but authorities in Madrid put the number at 15,000 without an immediate explanation for the disparity in the count.
The Swedish teen was followed on her first day in Madrid by a swarm of cameras and reporters, as well as curious members of the public wanting to film her on their smartphones, from the very first step she took out of an overnight train from Lisbon.
Two young activists earned cheers as they abseiled from a bridge and strung out a banner saying: “Just 8 years till 1.5 degrees C. HOW DARE YOU?” — a reference to scientists’ forecasts of rising temperatures and what activists complain is a lack of a convincing political response to the threat.
The crush as people tried to get a glimpse of Thunberg led her to pull out shortly after the start of the march, saying police had advised her to leave for safety’s sake, and she climbed into an electric car.
A Madrid police spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity because she wasn’t authorised to be named in media reports said that it had only been “suggested” to that Thunberg leave after she appeared “overwhelmed” by the attention and that police never ordered the activist to abandon on safety grounds.
Earlier in the day, the 16-year-old had said at a press conference that calls for real action against climate change are still being “ignored” by political leaders despite their continuous praise of the global environmental youth movement she helped create.
Thunberg hoped the COP25 summit would lead to “something concrete” and “increasing awareness among people in general,” but she said that after more than one year of student strikes” still basically nothing has happened.”
“The climate crisis is still being ignored by those in power,” she added.
During the Dec. 2-13 talks, nearly 200 countries are meant to streamline the rules on global carbon markets and agree on how poor countries should be compensated for destruction largely caused by emissions from rich nations.
An official directly involved in the negotiations said that despite a few setbacks, the technical negotiations were progressing, although many issues were being left for ministerial-level meetings in the summit’s second and final week.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the discussions, added that a political declaration on greater “ambition” — a buzzword at the summit — was shaping to be “difficult to achieve.”
“A summit that doesn’t end with enhanced ambition would be something that nobody would understand if we take into account what the streets and science are telling us,” the official said.
The talks came as evidence mounts about disasters that could ensue from further global warming, including a study published Friday predicting that unchecked climate change could devastate fishery industries and coral reef tourism.
The study commissioned by 14 nations whose economies rely heavily on the sea says climate change could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in losses by 2050, adding that limiting global warming would lessen the economic impact for coastal countries, but that they also need to adapt to ocean changes.
Demands for greater action by non-governmental organisations and a whole new generation of environment-minded activists were expected to take the spotlight with the presence of Thunberg in Madrid.
Past appearances have won her plaudits from some leaders — and criticism from others who’ve taken offence at the angry tone of her speeches.
Asked about the scepticism on global efforts to fight the warming temperatures expressed by some world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, she said: “Some people want everything to continue like now, they are afraid of the change that we, the youth, are bringing.”
“They try so desperately to silence us,” she added.
Next to her, Vanessa Nakate, a 22-year-old member of Uganda’s chapter of Fridays for Future said that young activists don’t want more promises.
“We are tired of the praises that you keep giving the activists,” she said. “We want you to act.”
During a brief visit to the summit venue earlier on Friday, Thunberg did not appear unsettled by the commotion surrounding her presence.
“It’s absurd. I laugh at it. I do not understand why it has become like this,” she was quoted as saying by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet.
“I don’t like being at the centre of the focus all the time, but this is a good thing,” she told Aftonbladet. “As soon as the media writes about me, they also have to write about the climate crisis. If this is a way to write about the climate crisis, then I guess it is good.”
Separately Friday, an alliance of American states, cities, academic institutions and companies opened its own venue at the UN climate talks, aiming to show that despite the federal administration’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris accord, many Americans remain committed to the treaty’s goal of curbing global warming.
Elan Strait, who manages the “We Are Still In” initiative for the environmental conservationist World Wildlife Fund, said the movement is “a short-term band-aid not only to get those carbon dioxide emissions down but also to encourage policymakers to lay the ground for further achievements.”
“And that, regardless of the colour of the government that is in power,” Strait said.
Over 3,800 organizations and corporations representing 70% of US economic output have joined the coalition, organizers claim, amounting to roughly half of the country’s emissions.

194,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/giant-fire-near-sydney-may-burn-for-weeks-as-people-struggle-to-breathe/,"MELBOURNE: A giant bushfire on the edge of Sydney, which has blanketed the city in smoke causing a spike in respiratory illnesses and the cancellation of outdoor sports, will take weeks to control but will not be extinguished without heavy rains, firefighters said.
Thousands of weary firefighters, who have been battling bushfires for a month, were on Saturday fighting nearly 100 blazes in New South Wales state.
The mega fire north of Sydney, Australia’s largest city, was created on Friday when several fires merged and was now burning across 335,000 hectares (830,000 acres).
“We need flooding rain to put these fires out. That’s really what is going to stop it,” said the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “These will take many weeks to put out.”
Bushfires are common in Australia during the hot summer, which begins in December, but this year the fires started much earlier, blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson.
A three-year drought has left much of Australia tinder dry.
The fires around Sydney have been pumping such vast amounts of smoke into the air that they appear as significant rain on the radars, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.
New South Wales Health said late on Friday that some 1,140 people had sought medical assistance for breathing issues or asthma in the past week – a quarter more than in a typical week. NSW Ambulance fielded about a third more calls.
Six people have been killed, nearly 700 houses burnt down and millions of hectares of land razed.
Strong winds fanned flames towards several suburbs in southwest Sydney on Saturday.
“It’s been going on all day, a fire came from the back and we put it out. But then another one came from the side so the firies covered the house in foam.,” said Luke Wright who helped save his brother’s home.
“The fence has been damaged but that’s about it, very lucky,” Wright told local media.
Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said the worst might still be ahead, with temperatures forecast to rise into the 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in coming days and no meaningful rainfall expected until late January.
“It’s a tough couple of months ahead yet and we’ve already seen the horrific consequences of fire so far this season,” Fitzsimmons told Australia’s 9News on Saturday.
Neighbouring Queensland state was battling some 45 bushfires and temperatures on Saturday as high as 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).

195,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/extreme-heat-hitting-rich-and-poor-harder-global-climate-index-shows/,"MADRID: Worsening heatwaves are taking a heavier toll on rich as well as poor countries, according to an annual ranking that measures the damage done by extreme weather to human life and economies.
The Global Climate Risk Index, published on Wednesday by environmental think-tank Germanwatch, rated Japan as the most weather-affected country in 2018, hit by a triple whammy of extreme summer heat, torrential rainfall and the most powerful typhoon in a quarter-century.
Germany, another industrialised country, was in third position as its hottest-ever April-July period led to the deaths of more than 1,200 people and widespread drought in 2018.
India – in fifth position – suffered one of its longest-ever heatwaves that year, bringing water shortages, crop failures and riots, on top of monsoon floods and two strong cyclones, Germanwatch said in a report.
“Recent science has confirmed the long-established link between climate change and the frequency and severity of extreme heat,” it added in a statement.
In 2018, the severe summer heatwave in Japan killed 138 people and caused more than 70,000 people to be hospitalised with heat stroke and exhaustion, the report said.
Across Europe, scientists calculate extreme heat spells are now up to 100 times more likely than a century ago, it added.
The report noted that the impact of heatwaves on African nations may be under-represented due to a lack of data.
Powerful storms, meanwhile, left a trail of destruction in 2018, with the Philippines second in the climate risk index due to large losses inflicted by top-strength Typhoon Mangkhut.
Madagascar was the fourth most weather-hit country as two cyclones killed about 70 people and forced 70,000 to seek refuge.
In Kenya and Rwanda – seventh and eighth in the index – seasonal rains were much heavier than normal, causing floods that destroyed homes and livestock and fuelled diseases.
Laura Schaefer, a policy advisor with Germanwatch, told journalists at the U.N. climate talks in Madrid that the index results showed that the “signs of climate crisis”, on all continents, could no longer be ignored.
“But climate impacts most existentially hit developing countries and communities around the world – and create a real climate crisis for millions of people,” she said, adding that the poor had the fewest resources to cope.
Between 1999 and 2018, seven of the 10 places most affected by extreme weather were lower-income developing nations, with Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti at the top, Germanwatch said.
In the past 20 years, nearly half a million deaths were directly linked to more than 12,000 extreme weather events worldwide, while economic damages exceeded $3.5 trillion, the report said.
At the U.N. climate talks on Wednesday, Chile’s environment minister, who is presiding over the conference, and U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa told journalists Latin American nations were vulnerable to weather disasters fuelled by climate change, highlighting the need for them to become more resilient.
Espinosa said her own country, Mexico, suffered every year from droughts, floods and wildfires.
“It is not about whether this year it will be bad. No, it is about how bad and where?” she said. “This is the reality of almost all the countries in the region.”
Germanwatch joined developing states and aid agencies in urging U.N. negotiators to regularly assess the needs of vulnerable countries struggling with “loss and damage” linked to climate change, and provide new funding to repair it.
Wealthy nations have long resisted pressure to stump up such finance, beyond expanding insurance programmes. But as the cost of extreme weather increases globally and planet-heating emissions continue to rise, that pressure is growing.
Renato Redentor Constantino, head of the Philippines-based Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities, said it was “plainly unacceptable” that those suffering the most had done the least to cause the problem, given their historically low emissions.
“The extreme weather events we have been facing are a result of emissions that the world failed to eliminate,” he said.

The report states that 11 countries in WHO South-East Asia Region — Bangladesh, Bhutan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Timor-Leste — had an estimated eight million cases and 11,600 malaria deaths, respectively 69 and 70 per cent less compared to 2010. Moreover, the Maldives and Sri Lanka have been certified malaria-free countries while Timor-Leste and Bhutan are close to elimination target.
The WHO report further stated that India reduced its reported cases by half as compared to 2017 and Bangladesh and Thailand also reported a substantial decline in reported cases.
All countries in the region are on target to achieve more than 40 per cent reduction in case incidence by 2020, and all have strategic plans for malaria elimination by 2030.
“There is a strong commitment to eliminate malaria in the region, reflected in the commendable intense efforts and progress being made by member countries. This momentum needs to be sustained and further accelerated to prevent, rapidly detect and treat malaria, to benefit everyone, everywhere,” Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia was quoted in the statement released by WHO.
However, the report claimed that despite progress, an estimated 1.61 billon people in the region are still at risk of contracting malaria with the disease being endemic in nine countries.
The progress and challenges in malaria elimination are periodically reviewed by member countries.

197,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/women/first-period-in-school-award-winning-uk-film-upends-bloody-shame/,"
LONDON: The award-winning short film, “My Time”, was inspired by seeing a friend being bullied at school for having a period stain on her clothes, its director Giulia Gandini said on Tuesday.
The young girl had just started her first period but the teacher refused to allow her to use the toilet during class – a rule that applies to seven out of 10 girls in Britain today, according to the children’s charity Plan International.

“I wish that I had seen this film when I was 12,” the London-based director, who grew up in Italy, said at a screening on Tuesday. “I developed this relationship to menstrual blood that was very negative.”
Gandini’s film is the latest to tackle the stigma around menstruation, following last year’s Bollywood movie “Padman” and the Netflix documentary “Period. End of Sentence.”, which won an Oscar this year.
Shame can be deadly. In Nepal, the centuries-old Hindu practise of “chhaupadi”, where women are banished from their homes during their periods, has led to numerous deaths from suffocation and snake bites.
Despite government schemes to provide free sanitary products in British schools, “period shaming” persists, with one in three women saying they have been bullied, isolated or joked about over “the curse”, research by the charity ActionAid found.
“It was a deliberate choice to set it in the UK – you still have this kind of shame and taboo,” said Gandini, adding that she only “started questioning why I was feeling so awful about something so natural” years after her friend’s humiliation.
Gandini said her goal as a filmmaker is to dispel stigmas and show the reality of young women’s lives in a positive light.
“Films don’t only reflect culture but they have the power to shape it,” she said, highlighting negative comments she received from men while making the film, with some asking, “Why should I care about menstrual blood?”
“My Time” has won multiple awards, including at the Chicago International Children’s Film Festival, London’s TweetFest and Sweden’s BUFF International Film Festival.
Gandini said her film has a happier ending than the event she witnessed at school, with a clear feminist message of “being proud of who you are”.

198,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/drug-can-curb-dementias-delusions-researchers-find/,"SAN DIEGO: A drug that curbs delusions in Parkinson’s patients did the same for people with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia in a study that was stopped early because the benefit seemed clear.
If regulators agree, the drug could become the first treatment specifically for dementia-related psychosis and the first new medicine for Alzheimer’s in nearly two decades. It targets some of the most troubling symptoms that patients and caregivers face — hallucinations that often lead to anxiety, aggression, and physical and verbal abuse.
Results were disclosed Wednesday at a conference in San Diego.
“This would be a very important advance,” said one independent expert, Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation.
Although the field is focused on finding a cure for dementia and preventing future cases, “there is a huge unmet need for better treatment” for those who have it now, said Maria Carrillo, the Alzheimer’s Association’s chief science officer.
The drug is pimavanserin, a daily pill sold as Nuplazid by Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. It was approved for Parkinson’s-related psychosis in 2016 and is thought to work by blocking a brain chemical that seems to spur delusions.
About 8 million Americans have dementia, and studies suggest that up to 30% of them develop psychosis.
“It’s terrifying,” said Dr. Jeffrey Cummings of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. “You believe that people might be trying to hurt you. You believe that people are stealing from you. You believe that your spouse is unfaithful to you. Those are the three most common false beliefs.”
He consults for Acadia and helped lead the study, which included about 400 people with dementia and psychosis. All were given a low dose of the drug for three months, and those who seemed to respond or benefit were then split into two groups. Half continued on the drug and the others were given dummy pills for six months or until they had a relapse or worsening of symptoms. Neither the patients nor their doctors knew who was getting what.
Independent monitors stopped the study when they saw that those on dummy pills were more than twice as likely as those on the drug to relapse or worsen — 28% versus nearly 13%.
There were relatively few serious side effects — 5% in the drug group and 4% in the others. Headaches and urinary tract infections were more common among those on the drug. Two deaths occurred, but study leaders said neither was related to the drug.
Carrillo said the study was small, but the drug’s effect seemed large, and it’s not known whether the federal Food and Drug Administration would want more evidence to approve a new use.
Current anti-psychotic medicines have some major drawbacks and are not approved for dementia patients.
“They’re often used off label because we have very few other options,” Fillit said.
All carry warnings that they can raise the risk of death in elderly patients, as does Nuplazid.
Cost could be an issue — about $3,000 a month. What patients pay can vary depending on insurance coverage.

199,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/restoring-forests-1-tree-at-a-time-to-help-repair-climate/,"MADRE DE DIOS, PERU: Destruction of the forests can be swift. Regrowth is much, much slower.
But around the world, people are putting shovels to ground to help it happen.
They labour amid spectacular recent losses — the Amazon jungle and the Congo basin ablaze, smoke from Indonesian rainforests wafting over Malaysia and Singapore, fires set mostly to make way for cattle pastures and farm fields. Between 2014 and 2018, a new report says, an area the size of the United Kingdom was stripped of forest each year.


Rebuilding woodland is slow and often difficult work. And it requires patience: It can take several decades or longer for forests to regrow as viable habitats, and to absorb the same amount of carbon lost when trees are cut and burned.
And yet, there is urgency to that work — forests are one of the planet’s first lines of defense against climate change, absorbing as much as a quarter of man-made carbon emissions each year.
Through photosynthesis, trees and other plants use carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to produce chemical energy to fuel their growth; oxygen is released as a byproduct. As forests have shrunk, however, so has an already overloaded Earth’s capacity to cope with carbon emissions.
Successful reforestation programs take into account native plant species. They are managed by groups with a sustained commitment to monitoring forests, not just one-off tree planting events. And usually, they economically benefit the people who live nearby — for instance, by creating jobs, or reducing erosion that damages homes or crops.
The impact could be great: A recent study in the journal Science projected that if 0.9 billion hectares (2.2 billion acres) of new trees were planted — around 500 billion saplings — they could absorb 205 gigatonnes (220 gigatons) of carbon once they reached maturity. The Swiss researchers estimated this would be equivalent to about two-thirds of man-made carbon emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
Other scientists dispute those calculations, while some fear the theoretical promise of tree-planting as an easy solution to climate changes could distract people from the range and scope of the responses needed.
But all agree that trees matter. And in many places around the world, people are working to revive them:
— In a region of southeastern Peru called Madre de Dios, forestry researcher Jhon Farfan inspects lands where the forest has already been lost to illegal gold mining.
After cutting and burning centuries-old trees, miners used diesel pumps to suck up deep layers of the earth, then pushed the soil through filters to separate out gold particles. To turn gold dust into nuggets, they stirred in mercury, which binds the gold together but also poisons the land.
Left behind are patches of desert-like land — dry, sandy, stripped of topsoil and ringed by trunks of dead trees.
Last December, Farfan and other scientists with the Peru-based nonprofit CINCIA planted more than 6,000 saplings of various species native to this part of the Amazon, including the giant shihuahuaco, and tested different fertilizers. Since the project began three years ago, the team has planted more than 42 hectares (115 acres) with native seedlings, the largest reforestation effort in the Peruvian Amazon to date.
— After miners left West Virginia’s Cheat Mountain in the 1980s, there was an effort to green the coal mining sites to comply with US law. The companies used heavy machinery to push upturned soil back into place, compacting the mountainside with bulldozers. The result was soil so packed in that rainwater couldn’t seep down, and tree roots couldn’t expand.
Companies planted “desperation species” — grasses with shallow roots or non-native trees that could endure, but wouldn’t reach their full height or restore the forest as it had been. On Cheat Mountain and at other former mining sites across Appalachia, more than a million acres of former forests are in similar arrested development.
Now Michael French, director of operations for the Kentucky-based nonprofit Green Forests Work, and his colleagues are collaborating with the US Forest Service to restore native Appalachian forests and the rare species they support — by first tearing down other trees.
Green Forests Work has reforested around 800 acres within the Monongahela, and it is taking a similar approach to other former mining sites across Appalachia, having reforested around 4,500 total acres since 2009.
— Maria Coelho da Fonseca Machado Moraes, nicknamed Dona Graça, runs a tree nursery that grows seedlings of species native to Brazil’s lesser-known jungle — the Atlantic coastal rainforest.
She collaborates with a nonprofit group called Save the Golden Lion Tamarin, which works to protect and restore the forest habitat of the endangered namesake monkey. “The Atlantic rainforest is one of the planet’s most threatened biomes, more than 90% of it was deforested,” said Luis Paulo Ferraz, the nonprofit’s executive secretary. “What is left is very fragmented.”
As she nears 50, Dona Graça says she is furious at what has happened to the forest, which was whittled down to allow for the urban expansion of Rio de Janeiro and other cities.
And so, between feeding her chickens and raking the leaves, she grows seedlings of rare species. She mixes limestone and clay, places it in plastic nursery bags and plants seeds in them. She irrigates them with water and cow urine.
Local replanting efforts — which aim to reconnect fragmented parcels of forest — often use the seedlings from Dona Graça’s nursery.
She does this, she said, for posterity.
“In the future when I pass away … that memory I tried to leave for the people is: It’s worth it to plant, to build,” she said.

200,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/two-members-leave-nobel-literature-committee-lamenting-slow-pace-of-change/,"STOCKHOLM: Two external members of the Nobel literature prize committee quit on Monday, with one of them saying the work to reform the scandal-hit Swedish Academy was taking too long.
The 233-year-old Academy was forced to introduce a several new measures after a sex scandal involving the husband of a former member escalated into a bitter row that resulted in them having to postpone the award for 2018.
One of the actions taken was adding external members to assist the Nobel committee choose prize candidates for the 18-man strong Academy to vote on.
“I leave my job in the Nobel Committee because I have neither the patience nor the time to wait for the result of the work to change that has been started,” author Kristoffer Leandoer said in an article published in Svenska Dagbladet. “The Academy and I have a different perspective on time, one year is far too long in my life and far too short in life of the Academy.”
Leandoer said quitting was not linked to the decision to award the 2019 prize to controversial Austrian writer Peter Handke, for which the Academy has received criticism both domestically and internationally.
The Academy confirmed in a statement that Leandoer and Gun-Britt Sundstrom had left the Nobel committee, which until today was comprised of four members of the Swedish Academy and five external members.
Sundstrom could not immediately be reached for comment.
“We are grateful for the significant effort they made during the year and we are now reviewing how the work of the Nobel Committee will be organised for the 2020 Nobel Prize in literature, ” Mats Malm, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, said in the statement.

MELBOURNE: The number of suspected cases of measles on the Pacific island of Samoa has more than doubled over the past week to 3,530 and deaths related to the outbreak rose to 48 from 20 a week ago, the country’s Ministry of Health said on Sunday.
Samoa has become vulnerable to measles outbreaks as the number of people becoming immunised has declined with the World Health Organisation (WHO) saying vaccine coverage is just about 31%.
The government started a mandatory vaccination programme on Nov 20 after declaring a state of emergency due to the outbreak. The health ministry said in its statement that 57,132 people have since been vaccinated.
Schools and universities have been closed and most public gatherings banned on the island state of just 200,000, located south of the equator and halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand.
Of the 48 deaths, 44 were among children under the age of four. Since Saturday, there have been 173 new cases of measles recorded and four people have died.
Neighbouring New Zealand and a number of other countries and organisations, including the UN agency UNICEF, have delivered thousands of vaccines, medical supplies and have sent medical personnel to help with the outbreak.
Measles, a highly contagious virus that spreads easily through coughing and sneezing, has been reported also in other Pacific nations, including Tonga and Fiji, but there have been no reports of deaths and the countries have greater vaccination coverage.
Tonga’s ministry of health said in a statement late last week that there were 394 cases of suspected measles identified, but only eight people required hospitalisation.
Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as parents shun immunisation for philosophical or religious reasons, or fears, debunked by doctors, that such vaccines could cause autism.

Swedish activist Greta Thunberg had been due to join a student strike in Lisbon, but her environmentally friendly voyage across the Atlantic from New York by yacht was hit by high winds, delaying her by a few days, she told social media followers.
Portugal’s student movement still expected thousands to join marches on Friday, building on the famous campaigner’s imminent arrival to mobilise ahead of the United Nations climate summit in Madrid from December 2-13.
“We wish she’d been here, but the movement has to carry on without her. We’ve got to send our message and pressure politicians ahead of the climate summit,” Marianna Louca, 14, told Reuters in Lisbon.
Friday’s climate strikes are expected to take place in 2,300 cities in 153 countries around the world, according to the climate campaign group Friday For Future.
It comes as experts have warned that global temperatures could rise sharply this century with destructive consequences after greenhouse gas emissions hit record levels.
Dozens of young people gathered in Bangkok for a climate strike in solidarity with others around the world, chanting: “No more coal, no more oil, keep the carbon in the soil.”
In Warsaw, activists, some in gas masks, waved banners saying: “Save our planet” and “Poland without coal 2030”.
In Berlin, protesters in swimming costumes dived into the chilly river Spree, holding up a white box in a symbolic attempt to rescue the government’s climate change package.
Activists protested at Amazon sites around France, using the annual Black Friday shopping frenzy to denounce what they said was the destructive effect of rampant consumerism, in a backlash against the event driven in part by environmental concerns.
Several dozen protesters staged a dawn sit-in outside an Amazon building in the Clichy district of Paris, holding a sign saying: “No to Amazon and its world.”
In Australia, students in Sydney and other cities walked out of class, saying more should be done to combat the country’s bushfire crisis, which many see as a result of climate change.
Australia has for weeks been battling wildfires, which have killed at least four people, burnt about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroyed more than 500 homes.
Holding home-made signs, including “The climate is changing, why aren’t we?”, demonstrators in Sydney accused the government of inadequate action in addressing the bushfire crisis. Smoke from bushfires in New South Wales state formed a haze overhead.
“Our government’s inaction on the climate crisis has supercharged bushfires,” said 18-year-old Shiann Broderic, one of the event’s organisers, whose home was destroyed in a bushfire.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has rejected suggestions his government is not doing enough on climate change.
Australia has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2030, but recent data shows emissions are unchanged.

Shalfa Avrila Sania, 17, had been due to leave for the biennial Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines on Nov. 26 until she was dismissed suddenly from the training in mid-November, her lawyer and family said.
“The coach said my daughter always goes out late with her male friends and their interrogation showed she was no longer a virgin,” her mother Ayu Kurniawati told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Indonesia‘s East Java province.
“I was shocked. I want my daughter’s name cleared,” the mother-of-two added.
Indonesia‘s sports ministry denied the claim on Friday, saying the dismissal was due to performance and disciplinary issues.
“We will take firm action if the athlete was sent back due to questions over her virginity because this is a matter of privacy, dignity and has nothing to do with performance,” it said in a statement according to Indonesia‘s Detik news website.
Kurniawati said her daughter had won nearly 50 medals since she took up the sport when she was eight, and rejected doubts over her performance.
The family has sent a letter to the ministry to protest her dismissal alongside a medical report that showed her hymen was intact, their lawyer Imam Muklas said by phone.
Parts of Indonesia – the world’s most populous Muslim country – remain conservative and some still value female virginity highly, although pre-marital sex is not uncommon among the younger generation.
Human rights groups have previously opposed “virginity tests” on Indonesian women seeking to join the police or military, saying the practice was unscientific and degrading.
Other attempts to introduce virginity tests on students in some Indonesian schools faced opposition, including from among Islamic clerics.

204,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/mris-of-dense-breasts-find-more-cancer-but-also-false-alarms/,"Giving women with very dense breasts an MRI scan in addition to a mammogram led to fewer missed cancers but also to a lot of false alarms and treatments that might not have been needed, a large study found.
The results give a clearer picture of the tradeoffs involved in such testing, but they can’t answer the biggest question — whether it saves lives.

For women with dense breasts trying to decide on screening, “the dilemma remains,” Dr Dan Longo of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote in an editorial published with the study on Wednesday.
About half of women over 40 have dense breasts and about 10% have very dense ones. That raises their risk of developing cancer and makes it harder to spot on mammograms if they do. US regulators are making rules to require that women get breast density information when they have mammograms, and many places provide it now. But what to do if you have dense breasts is unclear — it’s not known if more or different types of screening such as MRIs or ultrasounds help.
The study involved more than 40,000 Dutch women ages 50 to 75 with very dense breasts who had normal results from a mammogram, a screening X-ray offered every two years in the Netherlands. About 8,000 of them also were offered an MRI scan, which uses powerful magnets to create detailed images, and 4,783 women agreed.
Researchers then tracked how many breast cancers were detected in each group within two years. Finding more of these “interval cancers” implies that the initial screening may have missed them.
The rate of these cancers after two years was twice as high in the group that was only offered mammograms. This suggests that adding MRIs to initial screening did catch more cancers, but they also gave a lot of false alarms— about 80 per 1,000 scans. Three-quarters of women who had a biopsy after a questionable MRI turned out not to have cancer.
MRIs also led to more side effects during the scan or later testing, such as fainting or problems from an IV. And they cost much more than mammograms.
The study only looked at the first two years of screening with MRIs and it’s too soon to say whether the test will save lives.
Without such evidence, it’s tough to say what value there is in finding more cancers, especially many very small, early-stage ones, Longo wrote. Doctors already know that some of these will never cause symptoms or become life-threatening.
“Our dilemma is that, for most tumours, we cannot tell the difference between cancers that can kill you and those that cannot,” he wrote.

205,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/going-green-does-offsetting-carbon-emissions-count/,"
LONDON: Among the most hotly contested topics at international climate change talks in Madrid on December 2-13 will be the role of market-based mechanisms for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon offsets.
WHAT IS OFFSETTING AND WHY IS IT A TRICKY TOPIC?
Carbon offsetting allows a country to help reach its own emissions reduction targets by funding emission reductions in another country. Companies are also increasingly using carbon credits to offset their emissions.
The first major offsetting scheme, the UN’s clean development mechanism (CDM), was set up under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, in which 190 countries agreed to country-by-country emission reduction targets.
The scheme was designed to help fund emission reduction projects in developing countries, while also providing offset credits to the developed world to help meet its Kyoto targets.
Negotiators in Madrid are set to discuss what kind of offsets, if any, should be used to meet the targets set out in the 2015 Paris agreement and how they should be monitored, following some cases where emissions cuts did not materialise.
The issue of which country claims the emission reduction will also need to be thrashed out, to avoid double counting.
WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS QUALIFY?
Carbon offset schemes cover all greenhouse gases but are measured in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent and can be awarded carbon credits.
More than 8,100 projects in 111 countries have registered with the CDM scheme, which has handed out over 2 billion carbon credits, called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), representing 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide reduction.
Projects registered under the scheme range from capturing and using methane gasses in pig manure to create electricity to replacing traditional wood and coal-burning cookstoves with cleaner alternatives such as ethanol. Offsets can be bought by individuals, companies or countries.
WHAT ABOUT CARBON SINKS?
Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation, or REDD+, allows developing nations to earn carbon credits, which they can sell, when they reduce deforestation and degradation or conserve, rehabilitate and replant forests.
To qualify, carbon credits from REDD+ projects must be approved by the UNs Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
DO THEY WORK?
Proponents say offsetting can channel much-needed climate finance to developing countries.
Critics say offsetting emissions reduces incentives for the drastic emissions cuts needed to slow global warming and does not always bring the intended benefits; for instance, new trees may not grow as quickly as promised.

GENEVA: Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit a new record in 2018, rising faster than the average rise of the last decade and cementing increasingly damaging weather patterns, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Monday.
The UN agency’s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin is one of a series of studies to be published ahead of a UN climate change summit being held in Madrid next week and is expected to guide discussions there. It measures the atmospheric concentration of the gases responsible for global warming, rather than emissions.

“There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases’ concentration in the atmosphere – despite all the commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.
“This continuing long-term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea-level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems.”
The concentration of carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels that is the biggest contributor to global warming, surged from 405.5 parts per million in 2017 to 407.8 ppm in 2018, exceeding the average rate of increase of 2.06 ppm in 2005-2015, the WMO report said.
Irrespective of future policy, carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for centuries, locking in warming trends.
“It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago,” Taalas said.
Levels of methane – a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 – and nitrous oxide also hit new records, the report said.
The UN Environment Programme’s annual “emissions gap” report, due on Tuesday, assesses whether countries’ emissions reduction policies are enough.

“We still have a big problem at hand,” Samoa’s Director General of Health Leausa Take Naseri said in a video statement.

He said more than 140 new cases of people contracting the virus had been recorded within the past day, bringing the total to about 2,200 cases since the outbreak began last month. He said there are about 20 critically ill children who remain in hospital intensive care units.
Samoa declared a state of emergency nine days ago, closing all its schools, banning children from public gatherings and mandating that everybody gets vaccinated. Teams of people have been travelling the country administering thousands of vaccines.
The government also shut down a private clinic and is investigating how hundreds of vaccines were taken without authorisation and then sold for a fee.
The median age of those who have died is 13 months, according to government figures. The deaths include 24 children under the age of 5, 11 of whom were infants under 12 months. The other person who died was in their 30s.
In all, 679 people have been admitted to Samoan hospitals with the disease, accounting for two-thirds of all recent hospital admissions. A majority have been discharged, with about 183 remaining in hospitals.
“These hospitals are not designed to deal with this,” Dr Scott Wilson told Newshub in the capital, Apia. “The minute you get hospitals running at 200 to 300 per cent capacity — I think it speaks for itself. It’s incredibly serious.”
Figures from the World Health Organization and UNICEF indicate that measles immunisation rates among Samoan infants have fallen steeply from over 70% in 2013 to under 30% last year.
Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at New Zealand’s University of Auckland, said the Samoan government halted its immunisation program for several months last year after two infants died from a medical mishap involving a vaccine.
Tonga, Fiji and New Zealand have also reported outbreaks of measles but on a smaller scale than in Samoa. American Samoa, which has declared a public health emergency, is requiring that travellers from Samoa and Tonga prove they have been vaccinated or are immune from measles before being allowed into the US territory.

MELBOURNE: Deaths related to measles, mostly among small children, have more than tripled to 20 in the past week on the Pacific island of Samoa, the government has said eight days after declaring a state of emergency over the outbreak.
The island state of just 200,000, located south of the equator and halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, declared a measles epidemic late in October after the first deaths.
The government has identified 1,644 suspected cases of measles, more than doubling over the past week, with deaths rising to 20 from six, it said on Friday. Children younger than five accounted for all but one of the deaths.
The staff of UN agency UNICEF have delivered 110,500 doses of measles-containing vaccines this week as they fanned out across Samoa to boost its mandatory immunisation effort, the agency said in a statement.
It has also worked with governments of other tiny Pacific nations to run immunisation campaigns and develop preparedness plans to combat a regional outbreak, it added.
Australia is sending a specialist team of doctors, nurses and public health experts to Samoa, along with equipment and supplies, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Spine surgeons today stressed on maintaining healthy spine to live healthy life.
Spine surgeons from various countries, who have gathered here for the Himalayan Spine Symposium and the fifth annual conference, said spine health problems were rising along with the ageing population.
The doctors will be presenting their papers, discuss about innovative methods and technologies used in treating spine problems, share their experiences in the treatment of spine problems during the two-day conference.
As many as 95 spine surgeons from Nepal, India, Australia, Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, Norway, South Korea and the USA are participating in the conference that kicked off today.
The participants shared their papers on spine problems such as disc disease, adult spine deformity, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, shoulder balance, lumbar disc herniation, and cervical spine fracture among various other issues related with spine problems.
Interactions and panel discussions are also part of the conference where the surgeons will be discussing about the issues of spine problems across the world and new and advanced techniques and treatment methods.
The most common spine problem in Nepal is injuries. “We see a lot of patients with spine trauma especially from fall injuries, fall from a tree or from cliff, followed by motor vehicle accidents and infections such as tuberculosis. The conference helps all to learn from experience sharing by the doctors,” said Dr Gaurav Raj Dhakal, spine surgeon at National Academy of Medical Sciences, Bir Hospital who is also joint-secretary of the Association of Spine Surgeons of Nepal.
“As the ageing population is rising in the country, we need to raise awareness about spine problems both among adult and elderly.
Spine health is necessary as it is important for movement of limbs,” said Rabindra Lal Pradhan, chairman of the association, who also is the head of orthopaedic departments at Kathmandu Medical College and Teaching Hospital “Such conferences will help to educate both the doctors and public about the importance of spine health. The conference will also help the doctors exchange their ideas and experience on treating spine problems and technologies used during the treatment,” added Pradhan.

210,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/bacteria-infected-mosquitoes-take-bite-out-of-deadly-dengue/,"WASHINGTON: They still bite, but new research shows lab-grown mosquitoes are fighting dangerous dengue fever that they normally would spread.
Dengue infections appear to be dropping fast in communities in Indonesia, Vietnam, Brazil and Australia that are buzzing with the specially bred mosquitoes, an international research team reported Thursday.

It’s the first evidence from large-scale field trials that mosquitoes are less likely to spread dengue and similar viruses when they also carry a type of bacteria that’s common in insects and harmless to people.
Rather than using pesticides to wipe out bugs, “this is really about transforming the mosquito,” said Cameron Simmons of the nonprofit World Mosquito Program that is conducting the research.
The first hint of success came from Australia. Mosquitoes bred to carry Wolbachia bacteria were released in parts of North Queensland starting in 2011, and gradually spread through the local mosquito population. Dengue is transmitted when a mosquito bites someone who is infected, and then bites another person, but somehow Wolbachia blocks that — and local transmission has nearly disappeared in those North Queensland communities, Simmons said in an interview.
The real test would come in dengue-plagued areas in Asia and Latin America that regularly experience outbreaks where millions get the painful and sometimes deadly disease.
Thursday, Simmons’ team reported a 76% decline in dengue recorded by local authorities in an Indonesian community near the city of Yogyakarta since the 2016 release of Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes. That’s compared to dengue transmission in a nearby area where regular mosquitoes do the biting.
Researchers found a similar drop in a community near the southern Vietnamese city of Nha Trang. And preliminary results suggest large declines in dengue and a related virus, chikungunya, in a few neighbourhoods in Brazil near Rio de Janeiro.
The studies are continuing in those countries and others. But the findings, presented at a meeting of the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, suggest it’s possible to turn at least some mosquitoes from a public health threat into nuisance biters.
The work marks “exciting progress,” said Michigan State University professor Zhiyong Xi, who wasn’t involved with the project but has long studied how Wolbachia can turn mosquitoes against themselves.
Reducing disease “is the ultimate success of our field,” added University of Maryland biologist Brian Lovett, who also wasn’t part of the project.
More research is needed, specialists cautioned. These studies used local health groups’ counts of dengue cases rather than blood tests, noted Penn State University professor Elizabeth McGraw. And while Wolbachia has persisted in North Queensland mosquitoes for eight years and counting, whether mosquitoes maintain dengue resistance that long in harder-hit regions remain to be seen.
“The results are pretty exciting — strong levels of reductions — but there clearly are going to be things to be learned from the areas where the reductions are not as great,” McGraw said.
More than half of insect species, from fruit flies to butterflies, naturally are infected with Wolbachia — but not the main dengue-spreader, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. They’re daytime biters that thrive in hot urban and suburban localities where, for now, widespread pesticide spraying is the main protection.
Researchers with the World Mosquito Program first injected mosquito eggs with Wolbachia in a lab. Infected females then pass the bacteria on through their eggs. Releasing enough Wolbachia carriers, both the females that bite and the males that don’t, allow mating to spread the bacteria through a local mosquito population.
The approach doesn’t reduce bites. Simmons said the up-front cost is cheaper than years of spraying and medical care.
It’s just one of multiple novel mosquito-control methods under study:
—Michigan State’s Xi uses Wolbachia in a different way — to eliminate mosquitoes. Release only male Wolbachia carriers and when they mate with uninfected females, the eggs don’t hatch.
—Other researchers zap male mosquitoes with a small dose of radiation, sterilizing them before releasing them into the wild.
—Genetically modifying mosquitoes is another approach. Furthest in development is Britain’s Oxitec, which gives male mosquitoes a gene to weaken their offspring so they don’t survive to adulthood.
Each approach has pros and cons, but “our best hope to control the mosquitoes that make us sick is to box them in with multiple technologies,” said Maryland’s Lovett.

211,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/sydney-gasps-for-air-as-australia-bushfire-smoke-reaches-record-levels/,"MELBOURNE: The Australian state of New South Wales is gasping under the worst levels of air pollution recorded as smoke from widespread bushfires causes a spike in hospital visits and hazards including poor visibility for drivers.
Sydney, the country’s most populous city, woke up to a thick haze, and blood red sun, for the fourth consecutive day on Friday, even as a cooler change brought some relief for firefighters battling scores of wildfires across the country’s southeast.

The bushfires have pushed the harbor city into a rare appearance this week in the top ten cities with the worst air pollution in the world. Having reached as high as No 8, Sydney was sitting at No 10 on the Air Visual global rankings on Friday morning, above Jakarta and Shenzhen, and just below Mumbai and Kolkata.
The crisis has put pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison, with critics saying he had not done enough to address the impact of climate change on Australia.
“The impacts of the ongoing drought and recent bushfires have led to some of the highest levels of air pollutants recorded in New South Wales since air quality monitoring began during the millennium drought,” a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Planning, Industry and Environment said in an email.
Workers heading into the city and children going to school donned masks to deal with the hazardous air quality while 55 bush and grass fires still burned across the state after two weeks.
The smoke haze brought with it particulate pollution, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream, a danger that the NSW Health Ministry said had resulted in rising numbers of people showing up at hospital emergency departments.
In some areas of NSW and South Australia state, officials were advising motorists to take care while driving because of reduced visibility.
CLIMATE POLITICS
Bushfires are not unusual in Australia but the fire season has begun much earlier than usual, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees C (104°F) well ahead of the start of the southern summer and high winds hitting a landscape that has been parched by three years of drought.
Bushfires have already left at least four people dead and destroyed more than 400 homes across two states since the start of November. Fires are still burning in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland states.
“We have a long way to go,” Victoria Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said on Australian Broadcasting Corp television.
Morrison on Friday again rejected any links between the fires and his conservative government’s policies, including support for the coal industry.
“The suggestion that Australia, by having some trade-off where we could have higher emissions reduction targets, which would destroy jobs in regional communities, if we did that, then we wouldn’t be having these fires. That is just not true,” Morrison told 3AW radio.
Morrison’s conservative government has committed to the Paris Agreement to reduce its emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2030. Critics point out that current projections suggest it will not meet that target and have called on the government to put in place policies to address the shortfall.

GRAND JUNCTION: Thousands of students in Colorado were out of school Thursday because of a suspected outbreak of norovirus.



All 46 schools in the district serving Grand Junction and the surrounding area were closed and won’t reopen until after the Thanksgiving break so custodians can disinfect surfaces.
Norovirus is a highly contagious bug that causes diarrhoea, vomiting and other symptoms, and can spread quickly in public places. It’s most common in winter but can be seen any time of year.
The outbreak was first seen last week at a high school before spreading to other schools.
Officials in the district, the largest in western Colorado with 22,000 students, believe there is now another related strain of the virus that has affected some students who were previously sick.
“We are taking this highly unusual action because this virus is extremely contagious and spreading quickly across our schools,” district nursing coordinator Tanya Martin said.
It’s not clear how many students have become sick. Some custodians also became ill, slowing down the cleaning process, but it’s unknown if the suspected viruses were to blame.
Nicole Comstock, communicable disease deputy branch chief for the state Department of Public Health and Environment, told The Daily Sentinel that there are about 150 to 200 suspected norovirus outbreaks in the state each year.
She said most occur at nursing homes but outbreaks at schools are not uncommon.
The US Air Force Academy outside Colorado Springs reported that 400 cadets have been sickened by norovirus since October, but the outbreak hasn’t disrupted classes.
The Gazette reported that infected cadets are kept on bed rest for at least three days after their symptoms disappear before they can be cleared to return to class and training.

TBILISI: City dwellers tend to live longer if they are in leafy neighbourhoods, according to a study published on Wednesday that linked green areas to lower rates of premature death.
Trees in cities are already credited with cooling and cleaning the air and absorbing planet-warming gases, now researchers at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health have found they also keep death at bay.
“More green space is better for health,” said Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, director of the institute’s urban planning, environment and health initiative. “People actually live longer if there is more green space around.”
The research, which pulled data from nine other studies involving more than eight million people in seven countries from China to Canada, was the largest ever conducted on the subject, the authors said.
Researchers used satellite images to quantify how much vegetation, including trees, grass and shrubs, was within 500 metres (550 yards) of people’s homes.
Levels of vegetation were ranked on a scale under a system known as normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI).
Those involved in the study were followed for several years. Any premature deaths caused by health conditions such as heart or respiratory diseases were factored in.
The study, published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal, found that in cities from Barcelona to Perth, a 10% increase in greenery led to an average 4% reduction in premature mortality.
While researchers did not look into specific causes, Nieuwenhuijsen said access to vegetation was known to benefit mental health, reduce stress, cut pollution and encourage physical activity.
“What we need to do is increase green space in many cities … so that people can actually live a healthy life,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.
A “nice green city” would have between 20% and 30% of every area covered in vegetation, he said.
With the United Nations estimating two-thirds of the world’s population will live in urban areas by 2050, many cities are already looking at ways to increase greenery, according to the C40 network of cities tackling climate change.
Medellin in Colombia has planted thousands of trees to form “green corridors” along main roads, while Australia’s Melbourne was looking to almost double its canopy cover to 40% by 2040.
“Green spaces are good for cities and good for citizens,” Regina Vetter, who manages C40’s “Cool Cities Network,” said in a statement.
“Trees, meadows, wetlands and other green space are also vital to prepare our cities for the impacts of the changing global climate. They reduce the risks of flooding, lower temperatures and improve air quality.”

LONDON: Omega-3 fish oil supplements can improve attention in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) just as much as drug treatments, but only in those whose blood levels of omega-3 are low, trial results showed on Wednesday.
Researchers in Britain and Taiwan who conducted the placebo-controlled trial with 92 children said their findings suggest a “personalised medicine” approach should be adopted in this and other psychiatric conditions.
“The omega-3 supplements only worked in children that had lower levels of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) in their blood, as if the intervention was replenishing a lack of this important nutrient,” said Carmine Pariante, a professor at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience at King’s College London who co-led the trial.
He said the work sets a precedent for other nutritional interventions and could be the start of “bringing the benefits of ‘personalised psychiatry’ to children with ADHD”.
ADHD is a common brain condition that affects an estimated 3% to 7% of people worldwide. Symptoms can include problems with attention and impulsivity that cause difficulties in academic, work and personal relationships.
In this study, published in the journal Translational Psychiatry, researchers from King’s and from the China Medical University in Taiwan conducted a randomised controlled trial with 92 children aged 6 to 18 with ADHD.
They were given either high doses of the omega-3 fatty acid EPA, or a placebo, for 12 weeks.
Results showed that children with the lowest blood levels of EPA showed improvements in focussed attention and vigilance after taking the omega-3 supplements.
Standard treatments for children with ADHD include stimulants such as Ritalin, known generically as methylphenidate, which can improve levels of concentration and focus in ADHD patients.
Pariante’s team said that while the amount of improvement in attention and vigilance from methylphenidate is generally 0.22 to 0.42, the effect seen in children with low levels of EPA in the trial was larger – at 0.89 for focused attention and 0.83 for vigilance.
But in children with normal EPA levels, omega-3 supplements made no improvement, and in those with high EPA, the supplements had negative effects on impulsivity symptoms.
The scientists warned parents should not give their children fish oil supplements without checking first with a doctor, and stressed that omega-3 levels can be checked with a blood test.

215,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/five-global-deforestation-hotspots-as-brazil-reveals-amazon-spike/,"
LONDON: A sharp rise in deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest drew global concern this week, spotlighting the environmental impact of the loss of huge swathes of the forest around the world.
The world lost 12 million hectares (30 million acres) of tropical tree cover – equal to 30 football pitches a minute – last year, researchers from Global Forest Watch found.
That has major implications for climate change as forests absorb about a third of the planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions produced globally.
Here are five deforestation hotspots to watch:
1. INDONESIA – The country has the world’s third-largest total area of tropical forest and environmentalists say much of the forest destruction is due to oil-palm plantations.
The $60-billion global trade in palm oil – a widely used edible oil, found in everything from margarine to lipstick – has faced scrutiny from green activists who have blamed its production for forest loss and fires.
Last year Indonesia’s government issued a temporary ban on new permits for palm plantations to protect its tropical forests, but watchdog officials say a lack of transparency has made it difficult to evaluate the moratorium’s effectiveness.
2. ROMANIA – Thousands of Romanians marched in Bucharest this month to protest widespread illegal logging, which protesters say they believe led to the deaths of two forest workers.
Those on the march demanded criminal investigations into the deaths and into attacks on forest workers, as well as improved tracking of logging and tighter legislation.
Romania, home to some of Europe’s last remaining virgin forests, loses between three and nine hectares of forest per hour to illegal logging, according to environmental group Greenpeace.
3. GABON – The Central African country came under scrutiny last year after the disappearance of hundreds of containers of illegally logged kevazingo, a valuable hardwood that is popular in Asia.
Lee White, a conservationist appointed as Gabon’s environment minister after the scandal, has vowed to fight illegal logging by strengthening governance of forests, citing political apathy and climate change for his move into politics.
The government, which has already banned raw wood exports and enlarged protected areas and national parks, is to receive $150 million over 10 years from Norway to help protect its carbon-absorbing tropical forests.
4. MALAYSIA – Together with neighbouring Indonesia, Malaysia accounts for 85% of global palm oil output. The industry is often blamed in the country for stripping tropical rainforests along with cattle ranching and soybean production.
Earlier this year the European Union passed a law to phase out palm oil from renewable fuels by 2030 due to global deforestation concerns.
However, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has rejected the link between the palm oil industry and deforestation.
The government has said about 60% of the country’s total oil palm planted area received the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil certification (MSPO), which requires growers to meet certain environmental protection standards and develop the industry sustainably.
5. BRAZIL – Government data showed deforestation in the Amazon region rose by nearly 30% in the 12 months to July, the highest level since 2008, confirming a sharp increase under the leadership of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.
The Amazon is the world’s largest tropical rainforest and is considered key to the fight against climate change because of the vast amounts of carbon dioxide it absorbs.
Last August widespread forest fires in the Amazon sparked global outcry. Wildfires are common in the dry season in Brazil but are also deliberately set by farmers illegally deforesting land for cattle ranching.

According to him, the results of the recently held by-election had reflected the situation that the NC was yet to be strong.
Stating that the NC was actively and positively playing the role of opposition in the government, Koirala clarified that the NC wanted to move ahead by being on board with the incumbent government.
Arguing that conflict of interest would not benefit anyone, he asserted the NC had adopted the path of consensus. He also pressed on the need for unity among all political parties in the country to safeguard the constitution and federalism. He also made it clear that instead of batting for secularism, he subscribed to the ideology that religion should be free.
He slammed the incumbent government for not delivering in keeping with the two-thirds mandate that it had.

A site of historical significance, Kailali’s Garva Durbar lies in derelict condition owing to lack of necessary conservation efforts.
The palace based in Khairala in Chure Rural Municipality-4 was built more than a century ago by the then Rana rulers. The three-storey palace with 83 windows and 53 doors is said to have been built for the purpose of collecting taxes and settling cases from Kailali, Kanchanpur and Doti districts.
“Nobody has lived in the palace for long and its repair is also long due. This site of historical importance is slowly falling out of shape,” said local Kalika Basic School Principal Chandralal Dhungana, accusing the state of not doing the needful to conserve the historical site.
After the Ranas left the durbar, a post office and a village development committee office was set up in the site in the past. But ever since the estate was set ablaze during the decade-long Maoist insurgency, the building has been uninhabited.
By this date, most of the doors and windows of the palace have fallen out of shape. Though Sudurpashchim Province government had allocated budget for renovation of the palace last fiscal, the budget simply froze after nothing in the way of renovation or repair could happen. Though budget has been allocated for renovation this year as well, no work has been done so far.
Locals have stressed the need of renovation of the palace, or construction of a new palace in the fashion of the old one if renovation is not possible.

Out of 19 seats that will be elected this time, one shall be appointed by President Bidhya Devi Bhandari and the rest shall be elected on the basis of majority by an electoral college consisting of provincial assembly members and chairpersons and deputy chairpersons  of the local levels.
Of the 18 NA seats to be elected, seven women, two Dalits, one from minority and differently- abled group and two from ‘other’ group will be elected by the Provincial Assembly members and chairs and deputy chairs of local levels whose votes will carry different weightage in the NA election.
Spokesperson for the EC Raj Kumar Shrestha said the EC needed at least 120 days to conduct any election, but since the poll body had less than three months now to hold election, it wanted the government to declare the poll date as soon as possible. “We hope the government will announce the poll date in a day or two.”
The EC held a meeting with representatives of political parties today and told them that it wanted to hold NA election before January 24. EC Spokesperson Shrestha said representatives of the political parties told the EC that they were ready to cooperate with the EC to help it hold the NA election in time.
Shrestha said if the dates of the NA election was announced soon, the EC could give more time to the political parties to register them with EC and for carrying out their election campaigns. Parliament Secretariat has asked the EC to conduct

Agitating locals had also closed Arughat bazaar, located on the banks of the Budhigandaki River, indefinitely to press for their demands.
Yesterday’s all party meeting also decided to submit an application to the home ministry for a review of the compensation.
“As per the meeting’s decision, an application will be filed for a review of the compensation rate. Similarly, the meeting has also decided to seek the release of land if the demands are not addressed within 15 days,” said the concern committee Gorkha Chairperson Jagannath Khanal.
Meanwhile, the project affected locals have also formed a committee to hold talks with the energy minister to resolve the issue.
The government has fixed compensation for land in the project affected area by dividing the land to be acquired into seven categories.

Normalcy has been restored in Kohalpur of Banke, where tension had flared up following an accident yesterday.
Yesterday, a 11-year-old schoolgirl Prakriti Chand of Tribhuvan Namuna Secondary School was critically injured after a truck knocked her down in front of her school in Kohalpur-10 in the morning.

The incident had sparked a demonstration during which irate locals torched the vehicle involved in the accident. There were also clashes with police that injured over three dozen persons, including both demonstrators and security personnel.
Amidst the tense situation, the local administration in Kohalpur had stepped up security and issued a prohibitory-zone declaration in Kohalpur area from 3:00pm yesterday. The prohibitory order stands still. With the tension subsiding, vehicles have begun plying and life has become normal.
Schools, however, remained closed owing to a decision of Kohalpur Private School Association Banke, PABSON Banke and N-PABSON Banke.
The victim of the incident has lost both of her legs and is now undergoing treatment at Lalitpur-based B&B Hospital.
In the wake of the accident, while an all-party meeting appealed for restraint saying the accident-related issue should be resolved through dialogue, a harmony rally was taken out here at the initiative of Kohalpur Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The rally had the participation of Chief District Officer Kumar Bahadur Khadka and chiefs of security agencies of the district and local bodies, among others.
On their part, local youths carried out a clean-up campaign to remove the mess, such as brickbats, stones and shards of vehicle windows, caused by the vandalism and demonstration yesterday. A clean-up drive was carried out in front of the school, the Kohalpur-based police office and New Road area.
Regarding the violence yesterday, student unions have blamed the same on infiltration of elements with wrong intention, and sought a fair investigation and action against the culprits.

Speaking at a programme organised to mark International Anti-corruption Day in Hetauda, Chief Minister Poudel argued that the anti-graft body would not have to stall development for investigating complaints that had been registered. “CIAA’s terror has spread across the country,” Poudel said, adding, “Development work has come to a standstill due to fear of the anti-graft body.”
CM Poudel urged the CIAA to clarify the reasons for halting works before investigating the complaints. “It is not good for the CIAA to torment any local level and people’s representatives without probing the complaint,” he added.
CM Poudel appealed the CIAA to end the practice of halting development works with the registration of a complaint. “All have got pretext to halt work by filing complaints,” he stated.
Poudel said it was the responsibility of all and sundry to help build a corruption-free society. He stressed the need to adopt good character in their lives. Poudel said his government had adopted zero tolerance against corruption and support from all was necessary to check corruption. Poudel said people in public posts have to translate zero tolerance towards graft into their lives to help make a corruption-free society.
“Corruption will come to an end only if public position holders carry out their duty sincerely. Not fulfilling one’s duty with honesty is also a form of corruption,” he added.

A meeting of the central secretariat of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) today amended the party statute including a provision whereby the party would pursue the goal of communism.
The amendment will come into force after endorsement by the party’s standing and central committees.
According to the amendment proposal read out by NCP Spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha after the secretariat meeting, the party’s strategic goal and fundamental programme is scientific socialism. “The party’s immediate programme is socialism-oriented people’s democracy. The party will create a base for socialism and establish socialism by implementing socialism-oriented people’s democracy on an immediate basis. But ultimately, the party will head towards the direction of communism,” added Shrestha.
The provision of ‘pursuing communism’ is new as the existing statute does not have such a provision, at least two senior NCP leaders confirmed. One of the two leaders was actively involved in drafting the existing statute.
The Himalayan Times could not independently verify whether the existing statute had such a provision as the party has not uploaded its statute on its website and a printed version was not available immediately.
One of the two leaders said the document was not uploaded on the website and was made available only in the printed version because of differences among party leaders over the statute dropping the provision of ‘communism’, among other things. The second leader, who was involved in statute drafting, said the provision was omitted from the existing statute due to a ‘technical glitch while printing’.
The party had drawn criticism, both from within and outside, that it had ‘relegated’ itself to becoming a ‘democratic socialist’ party by dropping the idea of communism. Following the criticism, the party had even formed a taskforce to make recommendations on the matter. The taskforce had recommended that the provision be included.
Political analysts say the amendment is meant to appease the traditional communist constituency who believe communism should be the ultimate goal of a communist party.
According to political analyst Jhalak Subedi, there are many dedicated communist voters and party workers who believe in communism and who might lean towards other communist parties just because their stated goal is communism. “So the political goal of the latest amendment is to minimise influence of other communist parties and establish the NCP as the mainstream communist party,” Subedi told THT. “There’s nothing more to it because the NCP is a party that has been practising capitalism.”

The 17-year-old, who is the first Nepali swimmer to win individual section medal, left the sporting fraternity stunned when she finished first in 100m freestyle event with a timing of 58.13 seconds to win her fourth gold medal in the ongoing meet. Indian duo Shivangi Sarma (58.15 s) and Annie Jain (59.04 s) came second and third, respectively.

Gaurika then teamed up with Duana Lama, Tisa Shakya and Anushiya Tandukar to bag bronze medal in 400m medley relay to end the campaign with a total of nine medals — four gold, two silver and three bronze.
Gaurika became the first athlete to win four gold medals in the same South Asian Games and equalled the overall record of Deepak Bista, who had bagged four golds from as many SAF Games.
With her nine medals in the 13th edition of the regional sporting extravaganza, Gaurika took her individual tally to 13 medals.
She was lost for words when THT spoke to her. “I am speechless and have not been able to describe the feeling,” said Singh.
“South Asian Games turned out to be very special, as I was not sure of winning. The fourth gold medal is the best as it came after stiff competition. And it’s more special as (social worker) Anuradha Koirala was among the audience,” said Gaurika.
She hoped that someone else would break her record. “I want someone to break my records at the earliest,” said Gaurika, adding that she would now focus on qualifying for Olympics, “as only nine months remained for the meet”.

The five-year project aims to benefit 100,000 youths, of which around 60 per cent are women. Of the fund that the Washington, DC-based multilateral lender has agreed to provide, more than half, or around $67 million, is going towards a component called ‘improving labour market outcomes for the vulnerable’. Under this component, the WB is supporting the controversial Prime Minister Employment Programme, which drew widespread criticism last fiscal as the money was haphazardly distributed among supporters of the ruling party. Rupak D Sharma of The Himalayan Times met Faris Hadad-Zervos, the World Bank country manager for Nepal, to discuss whether the YETI Project would actually help create productive job opportunities for Nepalis or support the government’s distributive and populist programme.

An interview with Faris Hadad-Zervos, the World Bank’s Country Manager for Nepal in Kathmandu, on December 6, 2019. Photo: Balkrishna Thapa Chhetri/THT
What is the Youth Employment Transformation Initiative (YETI) Project all about?
Growth, shared prosperity and poverty reduction are prerequisites for sustained development of Nepal. Nepal has set a vision of ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalis’, which can only be realised if the country has an ecosystem that can create sustainable job opportunities. So, Nepal needs to have sustainable demand for jobs and sustainable supply of labour. If you look at the WB’s work in Nepal, our focus is on infrastructure and investment climate. One key part of this narrative is having a cadre of well-trained and productive workers, especially young men and women, who can contribute productively to the economy. This is why the YETI Project is very important as it focuses on improving employment services and labour market outcomes. The project also aims to ease Nepal’s transition to the federal system. The project will empower and equip 753 local levels with the ability to identify job opportunities, raise youths’ access to jobs, find out those who need the training, create database on labour market and monitor the progress. Some of the components of the project will help strengthen 753 employment service centres at the local level, which will not only provide job seekers with pathways to employment but find sustainable ways to build capacity so that those youths can self-employ themselves. The project will also build a robust and sustainable employment information system that will continuously track challenges of the labour market, identify solutions, assess progress and manage employment data. So, the whole programme is about building systems and architecture and ensuring transparency.
YETI Project is particularly focusing on strengthening employment service centres in 753 local levels. In a country where jobs are in short supply, how will these centres, which work as a matchmaker between employers and employees, work effectively?
Nepal’s sustainable development storyline requires not just one intervention but a series of interventions. To address current employment challenges, Nepal needs to provide a predictable investment ecosystem for the private sector to thrive. Nepal also needs to build a system that enables the private sector to easily hire well-trained and productive workers. That system should also help workers to easily find jobs based on quality information about employment opportunities and required skills. So, on the demand side of labour, Nepal needs to have a proper investment ecosystem. Nepal needs to quadruple its investment in infrastructure to achieve the middle-income country status and meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. For that, Nepal needs to have a system that not only relies on public finance and financing from the WB, the Asian Development Bank and other development partners, but the private sector as well. However, focus should not be entirely on big infrastructure investment. Nepal needs to attract smaller investments of, say, $300,000 to $500,000, to promote SME (small and medium enterprises) culture. This will also encourage Nepalis, who have gone abroad, to return to the country with a start-up idea. These Nepalis will only return if there is friendly environment in the country. So, this is crucial. Eventually, if interventions made on the demand side of labour produce positive results, Nepal will still need adequate supply of labour to cater to the needs of employers. This is where YETI Project comes in, as it will help bring in more people into the labour market.
How transparent would this system be in terms of providing employment opportunities, as corrupt practices, such as patronage and use of influence to secure jobs, are embedded in Nepali society?
The YETI Project is fundamentally a project about systems, transparency and rigour in identification and selection of jobs, maintaining database of the labour market, monitoring progress and placement of youths. So, the whole project is basically a systems project. That’s why the bulk of the project is focused on creating an employment information system and building capacity of 753 employment service centres. These service centres will bring the project closer to the community, which will help identify people who needs jobs, life skills and on-the-job training. So, the whole idea here is about transparency and sustainability.
But the YETI Project document itself says fiduciary risk would be ‘substantial’ while implementing this programme. How is the WB planning to minimise this risk?
All World Bank projects must adhere to international good practices, in terms of fiduciary aspects and safeguards. That to us is a heavy line drawn in the sand. We are very conservative on this and we cannot compromise on it. The YETI Project is being executed by 753 local governments, which are very nascent and where execution mechanisms still do not exist. Furthermore, this is the first time Nepal is implementing a programme aimed at creating pathways to sustainable employment. Also, the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, the main project implementing agency, is working with WB procurement procedures for the first time. So, naturally, risks are expected to be substantial. But the project will strengthen fiduciary management capacity both at central and local levels by training procurement and financial management staff, and hiring skilled personnel.
The project also aims to support the controversial Prime Minister Employment Programme, which grossly misused taxpayers’ money last fiscal year. Is the WB in support of that distributive programme?
I want to be very clear on this. We are supporting new process, systems and methodologies to ensure there is adequate rigour and transparency in identification and selection of beneficiaries so that the programme can be sustainable. This project will make sure beneficiaries’ selection process is transparent and data-driven. It will also ensure that the beneficiaries are provided with adequate training and life skills so that they can sustainably gain access to employment opportunities. So, this project is all about institution building and new systems. The hope is that these new systems and these new processes will also benefit the Prime Minister Employment Programme.
Are you saying fund transfers under the PM Employment Programme will not be made through the World Bank’s loan?
Under the YETI Project, the temporary employment programme (the PM Employment Programme) would be wrapped around new systems, new setups and new institutions at the local level. So, the temporary employment programme will follow the new methodologies of the YETI.
Will the wages that beneficiaries of the PM Employment Programme receive go through the funding pool made available to the YETI Project?
Yes, they will go through this project. The project, being executed by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, contains a series of procedures on identification and selection of beneficiaries, training, capacity building and sustainability, which have been agreed upon by the WB, the Nepal government and the MoLESS, and they are consistent with global good practices. We are grateful to the Nepal government because it has asked us to set up these new systems that ensure transparency, which, we expect, moving forward, would also be used by the PM Employment Programme.
In February, the World Bank had said it would not provide unemployment cash benefits to beneficiaries of the PM Employment Programme. Why the change in strategy?
This is not a change in strategy. The objective of this is to set up a new architecture, which builds on transparency, sustainability and reliance on local governments. This is a new architecture. Anything financed under the YETI, including the temporary employment programme, must go through this system.
Does this mean the PM’sEmployment Programme would undergo radical reforms this year?
It is up to the government to take a decision on this matter. What I can tell you is that the current government had asked us to help create a new system. We are hopeful this new system will be very beneficial in the future for the Prime Minister Employment Programme as well.
Is the World Bank supporting the distributive employment programme to please the government with which it needs to work very closely? If that is the case, aren’t development partners such as the WB helping the government become unnecessarily strong or powerful?
YETI Project is separate from the Prime Minister Employment Programme. So it is important not to conflate these two programmes. I’d like to make a very bold claim here. Yes, we are here to please someone and that is the people of Nepal. Our main clients are, and have always been, 30 million Nepali citizens and the governments that they duly elect.
Lastly, YETI Project seems to have overlooked the problem of labour productivity in Nepal, which is one of the lowest in South Asia. Labour productivity is a big issue and it cannot be addressed by a single project. What is your take on this?
Labour productivity is actually a human capital issue. And human capital is all about quality health, education and nutrition. Our studies show that one additional year of quality schooling in Nepal can raise an individual’s earnings by eight to 10 per cent. Undernutrition in Nepal, on the other hand, reduces learning potential and productivity, and can reduce GDP by as much as 11 per cent. Also, investing in psychosocial stimulation during a child’s early years — ideally the first three years — can raise his or her adult income by up to 25 per cent. Nepal needs to look into these human capital issues as early as possible. We’ve seen that many Nepalis reach less than half of their productivity potential when they become adults because of quality health, education and nutrition issues. So, Nepal should not wait to address these issues when someone becomes employable or a young adult, but at an earlier stage to raise the productivity of future generations. But what is also important for Nepal is to focus on investment climate. YETI Project won’t be successful in the absence of demand for labour. And demand for labour can only come from an ecosystem that is investor-friendly, including for foreign investors. The flow of foreign direct investment may have been increasing in Nepal. But Nepal should not only look at the amount of money that is coming in. It should also look at payback period of these investments. If investors are looking at 20- or 30-year payback period, then they will think of picking and training their staff in such a way to build their productive capacity. But the conditions for long-term investments are predictability of regulations and rules, their effective enforcement and implementation, and a very positive ecosystem.

Locals have been agitating for the past one week demanding transparency in the rural municipality’s financial matters.  They accused the rural municipality chair and administration chief of financial anomalies.
More than a dozen locals, including policemen, were injured in a clash. Agitators damaged windowpanes and doors. Police had to fire five rounds of tear gas shells to control the situation after demonstrators tried to attack elected representatives inside the office premises.
Police have brought the situation under control and efforts are under way to resolve the dispute through an all-party meet.

Banke District Administration Office today issued an indefinite prohibitory order in Kohalpur area as the situation took an ugly turn this afternoon after a schoolgirl was critically injured in an accident.
Seventh grader Prakriti Chand of Tribhuvan Secondary School was critically injured when a truck hit her in front of her school in Kohalpur Municipality this morning. As the demonstration over the incident took a violent turn, the DAO issued an indefinite prohibitory order, banning people from staging protests. Police can open fire on people if they defy the order. Locals, however, can move around with permission of the authorities concerned.
Banke Acting Chief District Officer Krishna Chandra Upadhyay said the prohibitory order would be effective on the Nepalgunj-Kohalpur road passing through Pipari Chowk and Naubasta Chowk in the north, Rohini khola in the east and Kiran khola to the west.
Irate students and locals set the truck involved in the accident on fire. They vandalised hundreds of vehicles on Nepalgunj-Kohalpur road. Police had to resort to baton charge to bring the situation under control. As many as 24 persons, including Deputy Superintendent of Police Hem Bahadur Shahi and eight other cops, were injured in the incident.
All the injured are being treated in Nepalgunj Medical College. The condition of three is said to be critical.
Police had to fire two dozen tear gas shells and some rubber bullets to contain the situation. The tension that started off from Tribhuvan Secondary School reached Kohalpur bazaar chowk, where locals, parents and students pelted police with stones and brickbats. Kohalpur bazaar was shut due to the agitation and reinforcements were deployed from Nepalgunj to bring the situation under control.
Nepal Police and Armed Police Force have brought the situation in Kohalpur under control. “DAO has issued a prohibitory order to stop further damage,” said Acting CDO Upadhyay.
The truck, en route to Kohalpur from Nepalgunj, hit Prakriti while she was crossing the road to enter her school. Both her legs have received serious injuries. After she could not be treated in Nepalgunj Medical College, Prakriti was airlifted in a Nepali Army chopper to Lalitpur’s B&B Hospital, police said.

One of the locals, Prem Bahadur Gurung, urges that the durbar should be reconstructed completely as the structure is dilapidated and is beyond repair and renovation. He also claimed that the reconstruction will increase tourists inflow in the area.

Locals believe that the Department of Archeology should undertake the responsibility of reconstructing the ancient durbar built in 1984 Bikram Sambat (1927 AD) by the then Rana ruler Khadak Bahadur Shumsher. The foundation-stone of the durbar was laid on 1979 BS (1922 AD) and had taken five years to construct.
It was previously known as Shree Bahadur Shumsher Durbar under the name of the Lieutenant-General Bahadur Shumsher who received the durbar after the partition of property, however, the name was later changed to Garvaa after the name of the place.
Sudur-paschim provincial government had allocated a budget of Rs 5,000,000 for the renovation activities in the current fiscal year. However, no activities have yet been done. The budget allocated last year for the same purpose was unused and was frozen.

Locals have formed a pressure committee expressing concern about the inordinate delay in the construction of Ramraja Prasad Singh Academy of Health Sciences in Rajbiraj of Saptari.
At a public gathering organised in Biraul of Rajbiraj, a 121-member public pressure committee, to be led by social activist Sukharan Yadav, was formed.
“It would be great to have the proposed facility built here, but work regarding the same hasn’t started, which is unfortunate,” said then Dighawa VDC chairperson Bhupendra Yadav, calling on all and sundry to rise above partisan interest to help materialise the proposed facility.
Pressure committee coordinator Yadav pledged support for the project and sought cooperation from all.
The process of construction of Ramraja Prasad Singh Academy of Health Sciences had started after Rajbiraj Municipality decided to provide 61 bigha land in Biraul of Ward Number 10. Following the decision of the municipality, a seven-member committee formed by the government inspected the proposed site and submitted a report to the government in April this year.
An office for the construction project was also set up in Rajbiraj in July, which had started its work.But, the construction process came to a halt after Rajbiraj Municipality decided to give away part of the land pledged for the proposed facility to Global Multiple Cooperative, to set up an agriculture market there.
At today’s meeting, chairperson of the cooperatives and the pressure committee coordinator Yadav, however, clarified that the decision to set up a market for local agriculture products at the proposed site had by no means thwarted the government project.
“If we’re the reason why the construction of Ramraja Prasad Singh Academy of Health Sciences has been stranded, let me declare it from here today itself that our cooperative won’t come in the way of the government project,” Yadav said.

The identity of the deceased who appears to be in her mid-thirties is yet to be established.
According to police, the bus (Ga 1 Kha 5799), en route from Beshisahar of Lamjung to Gorkha, was stationed in a neutral position when it slipped and fell some 100 metres below the road onto Paundi Rive, at around 7:40 am, injuring eight passengers.

The injured were rushed to Sundarbazaar-based Karmada Hospital where the unidentified woman was declared dead upon arrival by the hospital doctors, informed Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Rabindra Man Gurung at District Police Office, Lamjung.
Among the injured, one is receiving treatment at the Karmada Hospital while four have been referred to health facilities in Chitwan for further treatment. According to police, two passengers who had sustained minor injuries have been discharged from the hospital.
There were 12 passengers on the bus at the time of the incident, informed the police.
After the preliminary investigation, police suspect that the incident occurred when the driver and driver’s assistant left the bus on to search for passengers.
Nepal police with the help of Armed Police Force(APF), Nepali Army and locals carried out the rescue operation.

Senior citizens in Dhankuta and other hilly districts have been deprived of facility of seat quota and 50 per cent discount in bus fare.
In a gesture of respect for senior citizens, the government had made the policy of reservation of two seats in each public bus and 50 per cent discount in fare for those above 60 years. Though the provision is implemented in Kathmandu and Tarai districts, senior citizens traveling along the Koshi Highway have been deprived of the facilities.
Senior Citizen Dhankuta Town Committee Chairperson Tika Prasad Ghimire warned of an agitation if the facilities they are entitled to were not given.
“Vehicles hardly stop for elderly people. Even if they take them on board, they are misbehavedwith, aren’t provided the seats they are entitled to or are forced to get off ahead of their destination, which is not fair,” he said.
Lately, after senior citizens reached out to the district administration office with written complaints, the administration is said to have been seriously working to ensure that senior citizens got the facilities.
Dhankuta Chief District Officer Krishna Bahadur Ghimire admitted that senior citizens were being deprived the facilities. “It’s true that elderly citizens are being neglected and not provided the facilities they are entitled to. We can end such practice by stepping up monitoring of the vehicles plying along the Koshi Highway,” he said. Transportation entrepreneurs have pointed out complexities in implementing the facilities for senior citizens.
“We’re ready to oblige senior citizens with the facilities they if they show us their identity cards. We can’t simply judge someone by their faces,” said Purbeli Yatayat Vyabasayi Company representative Gyan Bahadur Katuwal.

276,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-chapter-of-accidents/,"Heavy penalties are a must to strictly enforce the traffic rules for the safety of both passengers and pedestrians
Vehicular accidents are routine in Nepal, almost an everyday incident, and they fail to raise much concern except when a mishap involves many deaths or when the locals’ reaction to it spirals out of control, as in the case of Kohalpur on Sunday. Locals resorted to vandalism after a truck knocked down a girl while trying to cross the road to enter her school. The girl, a seventh grader, had to be flown in to Kathmandu after both her legs suffered severe injury and could not be treated in nearby Nepalgunj. After the demonstrations took a nasty turn, police forces had to be trucked in to quell the agitation and bring the situation under control. An indefinite prohibitory order has been put in place after irate students and locals set the truck involved in the accident on fire and vandalised hundreds of other vehicles on the Kohalpur-Nepalgunj road. At least 24 persons, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police and eight cops, were injured in clashes, three of them critically.
There are many reasons why accidents take place in Nepal. It’s all too easy to blame the mountain roads that are usually in tatters. Not only highways, even the streets of the capital are in need of major repairs. Even by the government’s account, it needs about Rs 88 billion to repair the country’s roads annually. But it has earmarked only one-tenth that amount for this fiscal. Add to the bad condition of the roads the poorly-maintained vehicles, overloading and drivers with poor driving skills, and you have a perfect recipe for a disaster. With vehicular accidents said to kill about 2,000 people annually in the country, the government must have a plan of action to rein in on the growing number of accidents in the country. With the increase in the number of vehicles year after year, the number of accidents as well as that of deaths and injuries will only increase if the concerned authorities do not act now.
Can something be done? The government could begin by making license issuance stricter. It is common knowledge that licenses can be bought in Nepal. Only recently, senior officials of the licensing department and traffic police officers were arrested by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority for having distributed 1200 licenses to those who had failed the trial or had not even appeared for it within a period of three months in 2012. Imagine the number of people who are driving vehicles in Nepal without deserving a license. The number of accidents would come down drastically if only everyone – both drivers and pedestrians – were to follow the traffic rules earnestly. Everyone is witness to public buses and micro-vans cramming as many passengers as possible to make some extra money for the driver and the helper. And one can see them speeding in the cities or on the highways to be the first to collect passengers. This greed to make a fast buck at the expense of the commuters is making travel unsafe for everyone.  The one thing drivers fear is heavy penalties. This will have to be strictly enforced to implement the traffic rules for the safety of both passengers and pedestrians.

Act prudently
Nepal’s constitution, which paved the way for the transition from a unitary to the federal system of government, has clearly laid out the framework for fiscal federalism. This framework allows provincial and local governments to prepare annual income and expenditure plans, providing sub-national governments the mandate to pursue development works. But local governments have lately been misusing their authority by getting involved in irregularities, according to a report prepared by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). The corruption watchdog’s report said local governments released payments to contractors prior to completion of the work and prepared project completion reports before completing the projects. The local governments also colluded with consumer committee members to haphazardly award contracts. These practices must stop.
Local governments are nascent. But that does not give them the leeway to engage in corruption. The CIAA has already asked them to refer to the Public Procurement Act before awarding contracts and releasing payments. It has also directed them to immediately terminate the contracts that were illegally awarded and start a fresh bidding process. Local governments should heed these calls, act prudently from now onwards and follow good governance practices.

The country’s oldest educational institution, Tri-Chandra Campus (TC), recently witnessed a strange event. Students physically assaulted the campus chief, Professor Pradeep Neupane. The incident happened when a mob, led by the ANNSFU (All Nepal National Free Students’ Union) that was protesting against the 100% fee hike in the Science and Humanities faculties, got enraged. ANNSFU is the student wing of the ruling party.
According to eye-witnesses and staff of Tri-Chandra Campus, the mob pulled Prof Neupane out of the building and on to the street, assaulting him several times on the way. As seen on the CCTV footages, Prof Neupane was thrown on to the floor, kicked and also walked over. At present, Prof Neupane’s office is padlocked, he is in a hospital bed, and nobody knows what is upcoming.
The government, human rights activists and Tribhuvan University (TU), the parent institution of TC, all are silent, but why? Will Prof Neupane be able to safely return to his workplace? Furthermore, will the ruling party take responsibility for the incident? These questions remain unanswered.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
TC has been growing as a hub of some ill-minded people in the name of student politics since the past couple of years. Students indulging in narcotics and drunkenness can be seen on the shabby side of TC. This is a threat to the genuine students.
This college is the first choice of students representing all social classes because of its nominal tuition fees and prime location. Because students coming from a higher social status have made it a transit point for abroad studies, the drop-out rate at TC is quite alarming.
It is more than 60% between the first and fourth year at the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.).
Professor Neupane has initiated some improvements at TC. Laboratories have been renovated with funds received from the University Grants Commission. The college, even though the oldest centre for higher education in Nepal, has been profoundly lacking in scientific equipment, requiring instruments worth more than Rs 10 billion.
Sadly enough, the student leaders seldom speak about the condition of the college, and what they have ever said about the state of the college is nothing but porkies. Nevertheless, the main problem is student politics at Tri-Chandra.
Constituent campuses of TU have the right to set up their own tuition fees after taking approval from the university. Prithvi Narayan Campus, Pokhara has set the annual fees at Rs 11,000 for General B.Sc. and Rs 24, 000 for B.Sc in Microbiology, whereas for B.Sc in Geology, one has to pay about Rs 33,000.
Another constituent campus of TU, Birendra Multiple Campus, Chitwan charges Rs 24,000 for B.Sc in Microbiology and Rs 36,000 for B.Sc in Geology, or B.Sc. in Meteorology. Private and community colleges, on the other hand, charge annual tuition fees of more than Rs 50,000, even for regular B.Sc General Science.
At Tri-Chandra, for the bachelor’s programme in Science, students had been paying Rs 7,000.
However, the fee has been raised to Rs 14,000 with the 100% hike mentioned earlier. This increment in fees is well-founded as the operational costs of the science programmes are incomparable to other disciplines.
Besides, the increment in fees does not affect the current students; it is only applicable for the next batch of first years.
Currently, there are more than 14,000 students studying at Tri-Chandra Campus, making it the largest campus in terms of enrollment.
Last year, this campus suffered a deficit of Rs 17 million because fees had not been adjusted for a long time. Most of the fees collected are spent on the payment of contract-based as well as part-time teachers, who unlike permanent faculties, are paid by TC itself rather than by TU.
As noticed by everyone, part-time faculties are a severe burden on the college, as they number very high. In physics, there are 46 part-timers; in microbiology, 36 part-timers; and in chemistry, 60 part-timers. The condition is quite similar in other departments as well.
Tribhuvan University has set a quota of 2,500 students for the B.Sc. programme, but TC is incapable of hosting such a mass. The campus has launched 18 different science combination programmes at the undergraduate level, which is probably the highest in all of South Asia.
No one has paid attention to addressing the shortage of classrooms on the campus. According to the students, some teachers do not attend practical classes. The college library severely lacks books. Such issues are not correctly handled by the college administration due to political polarisation and other reasons.
Currently, 40 per cent of the students enrolled in the Science and Technology programmes under the banner of TU have taken admission in TC. TU has five constituent campuses in the Kathmandu Valley, but students prefer to join TC, but this is not to be understood that education in TC is good. In reality TC is not able to deliver quality education.
This year, 343 students have given entrance examinations to join Amrit Campus, 62 to join Padmakanya Campus, 36 to join Bhaktapur, 118 to join Patan and 2,704 to join TC.
Because of the overflow of students, about 200 students attend the basic science laboratories, such as physics and chemistry, but their capacity is less than 40. Tribhuvan University has neither diverted the students to another college, nor has it managed the problems of TC.

Love has many colours and contours. And once I was also enveloped with the amorous version of love for one of my classmates in the university. It was otherwise a usual insipid day in the class, although our erudite professor was in his intellectual trance and was raining on us his blitzkrieg of unheard English words. A gentle knock on the door instantly drew my intention as I was sitting on the first desk quite close to the door.
A maiden bestowed with divine beauty and peerless grace elegantly sought the permission of the professor to come in. It was her first day in the class as she told me after the professor stopped droning on. Nidhi was somewhat late in taking admission, and thus she sought my assistance in managing with her backlog.
Over the months, we both became the best of friends and while studying together we would grab all the fun by bunking classes and watching the recently released movies. Now a close friendship was on the brink of blossoming into love. When we both were exactly on the same mantle wave length, I rolled out my feelings to her. In no time my love was reciprocated.
Cupid had now blessed me with my Muse. Like most of the lovers we also began to meet furtively outside the university and thereon decided to get spliced with each other for the life time.
But the much needed consent of her family could only translate our amorous dream into reality.
One day my Muse mustered up her courage and introduced me to her parents. But our destinies had different designs for us.
Her parents sternly disapproved our would-be love marriage, and tied her nuptial knot with someone else against her wishes. I was back to my home town with the degree of MA but without my Muse.
Twenty years have rolled by since I saw my love for the last time. After parting with her, I could not gel with any other girl. Having no malice against his Muse, this 46-years-old confirmed bachelor has now a vast treasure of memories of that elevating love.

279,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-cut-smoke-and-dust/,"The introduction of new technologies in Nepal could save both the ecology and economy while reducing the health hazards
Runaway urbanisation in the Kathmandu Valley has fueled a demand for construction materials, and bricks are the primary building material in the capital as they are in other parts of the country. One has only to take a stroll on the outskirts of the city, and you see dozens of brick kilns belching out thick stacks of smoke into the atmosphere. The pollutants not only impact the air quality and visibility of the surroundings, but also adversely affect the health of the workers and the local population. Brick kiln workers, who are directly exposed to dust and smoke day in, day out, are particularly prone to a host of respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, pneumonia, chronic cough, bronchitis and wheezing. However, a recent research done on 20 brick kilns of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur shows that majority of the brick kiln workers are unaware about the impact of dust and smoke on their health. Resource Centre for Primary Health Care had conducted the study to learn about the health status of the brick kiln workers and also about the occupational safety at the work place. The serious health risks posed to the brick kiln workers should be of concern to the government as well as the owners, and efforts must be made to reduce their exposure to smoke and dust.
The government has tried to ban the Fixed Bull Trench Kiln that is in vogue as it uses old and inefficient technology, which requires large quantities of coal to fire the bricks. The method is inefficient and poses a big threat to health and the environment as it releases large amounts of particulate matter, black carbon, sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Asthma and bronchitis apart, long-term exposure to such particles and smoke makes brick kiln workers susceptible to hypertension, cardiac problems and cancer. The brick kiln workers make up mostly migrants, who come to work for just six months, from December to June. The industry is largely unregulated, with the workers having no links to the local government or community organisations. This perhaps explains why the plight of the workers has gone largely unnoticed, except for occasional studies on health and pollution carried out by non-governmental organisations.
The emission of particulate matters and smoke could be drastically cut down by the use of improved technology in brick making. New technologies such as the Vertical Shift Brick Kiln (VSBK), Tunnel Kiln and Hybrid Hoffman Kiln are substantially cleaner than the Fixed Bull Trench Kilns. The brick sector is one of the most energy-intensive industrial sectors in Nepal. In the Fixed Bull Trench Kilns, energy cost is almost 32 per cent of product value whereas in a Vertical Shift Brick Kiln, it is 14 per cent. The introduction of new technologies in Nepal could save both the ecology and economy while reducing the health hazards. In February last year, the Ministry of Population and Environment issued standards for brick kiln emission and chimney height in a bid to limit air pollutants emitted by the brick factories. It is the government’s duty to follow up on them and see to it that the brick kilns abide by the rules so that everyone can enjoy the right to a clean environment.

‘Occupy Tundikhel’
Occupy Tundikhel campaign has entered its fifth week. During the campaign, scores of social activists have been organising various programmes daily to exert pressure on the government to stop the illegal encroachment at Tundikhel. According to historians, before 1950, Tundikhel covered the area from the Dashrath Stadium to the south to Rani Pokhari to the north. At present, its area has shrunk to the Nepal Army’s Pavilion adjoining Khula Manch, which is not open for the public. More than two-thirds of the area is occupied by construction materials meant for different construction projects around the Tundikhel area. The remaining area is used as a bus park, leaving no space for the public.
Tundikhel holds cultural significance and is part of the identity of Kathmandu. Tundikhel is an important community space that needs to be protected. Elsewhere, uncontrolled and unguided urbanisation has taken a toll of fertile lands that are inappropriate for construction. Government and community land has also been encroached and sold. The various guthi ponds in the Valley have been destroyed by the construction of shopping malls. A systematic and strictly enforced land use planning is essential for Nepal.

The inflow of remittances is an old topic in the study of migration, but one that has stimulated renewed policy focus in recent years. As global remittances are taking an upward trend to a degree that is on par with global development assistance and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the developing world, it is not surprising that this subject is of interest to policymakers.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Many reasons have been cited as to why migrants send money home. These include explanations of remittance behavior, such as ‘altruism’, which indicates that remittances go up when the economic requirements of families back home rise; the notion of ‘exchange’ which suggests that migrants are effectively repaying family and relatives for investments in the education or travel of the migrant; and the notion of ‘co-insurance’ where both migrants and family provide monetary and in-kind transfers to safeguard the other against short-lived shocks. It is generally agreed that remittances are likely to be higher in conditions where the migrant leaves the country due to economic rather than social or political factors, where they have temporary rather than permanent resident status, and where they have a family left behind.
The 2019 United Nations Report on the world’s progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) divulges that personal inflows of remittances from migrant workers are the largest source of external financing for low and middle-income countries (LMICs). According to the World Bank’s latest Migration and Development Brief, remittance flows to LMICs grew by 9.6 per cent in 2018 (up from the 8.8 percent rise in 2017), to reach a record $529 billion. They represent more than three times the size of official development assistance. Moreover, as FDI has been taking a downward trend in recent years, remittances stood close to the level of FDI flows in 2018. Further, in 2018, remittances represented more than 30 per cent of GDP in countries such as Tonga (35.2 %), Kyrgyz Republic (33.6 %), Tajikistan (31.0 %), and Haiti (30.7 %).
Remittance flows have a direct impact on recipient households by lowering poverty and inequality and increasing consumption and social well-being. They also have a positive impact on financial sector developments, such as increasing the access and use of financial intermediaries. They support in improving credit ratings of countries and help raise external financing.
Although remittances have a host of advantages, the remittance market, to a large extent, has not been exploited for prospective financial services. Furthermore, remittances are often not directed into productive investments  due to a) dearth of investment knowledge of the remittance clients, b) inconsistency in remittance transactions, and c) inappropriate investment-friendly climate. Again, remittances can produce currency appreciation, causing export prices to surge and import prices to be cheaper. Thus, there is a drop in export levels, and rise in import levels, which can impact the production markets by reducing employment.
An important disadvantage is that it can also encourage more migration of labour as family members obtaining remittances realise that they would be better off moving to other destinations and earn more money rather than staying back in their home country. Another drawback is that the country’s dependence on remittances increases. And, this could be alarming as an abrupt stop in these financial inflows could lead to a financial debacle.
In Nepal’s case, migrant remittances from abroad are a crucial source of income for the economy. They represented 2 per cent of GDP in FY2000, 22 per cent in 2010 and 28 per cent in FY2018. Though remittances have been generally used to finance consumption in the country rather than being channeled to raise productive capacity, spending remittances on consumption has, to some degree, led to improved private and public welfare.
However, there are also detrimental outcomes of being over-dependent on remittances. Too much dependence opens up Nepal to exposure to external shocks linked to remittance-sending countries. Likewise, remittance inflows have had a knock-on effect on imports. With exports dwindling, trade deficit has expanded.
Still, the overall impact of remittances in comparison to other types of international financial transfers has been encouraging and should be fortified more with appropriate policies without creating a dependency syndrome.
Remittances to Nepal have been generally observed as an important tool to reduce poverty and inequality, to impart social benefits, to act as buffers against economic shocks, and to produce other positive impacts. Still, their full developmental potential has not been realised so far.
The successful mobilisation of remittances for productive purposes basically hinges on the capacity of the government to build a ‘development-centred’ macroeconomic environment along with supporting the establishment of a viable and inclusive financial sector. Likewise, joint and intensive efforts must be aimed at establishing and improving the mechanisms through which the principal actors, especially the individual remittance senders and recipients, can leverage these flows for developmental purposes.

281,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/an-unusual-samaritan/,"On October 31 this year, I was travelling to Trivandrum, India, to participate in the Counseling course conducted by Don Bosco, Trivandrum. I boarded Nepal Airlines at Tribhuvan International Airport at 2.30 p.m. I took my allotted seat, and to my left were seated two young ladies. They were Nepalis and going to Bangalore. They were engrossed in their mobiles
while I sat reading a book “Treasure of Life” on the topic “Happiness”.
Being an extrovert, I wanted to talk to the lady sitting right next to me. But I was hesitant to talk to her, because I was a stranger to her as she was to me on the plane. Finally, I gathered enough courage and asked, “Bahini (sister) where do you stay?”
“I live in Kathmandu and am going for IT training in Bangalore,” she replied. I told her about myself that I was from St. Xavier’s School, Jawalakhel. She then said, “My brother went to St. Xavier’s School, Jawalakhel.”
As the flight was about to land at Bangalore, I wished her, “All the best for your training.”
We parted while deboarding the plane. From Bangalore, I was to take the flight on Indigo Airlines to Trivandrum at 8.20 that evening according to the booked ticket time. But the scheduled time had been brought forward to 6.25 p.m., and so at Bangalore Airport, I missed the flight to Trivandrum.
There were no flights to Trivandrum that evening. At the counter, I was told that there would be a flight to Trivandrum at 5.05 in the morning the following day, that is, November 1. But I did not have enough money to buy the air ticket to Trivandrum. I really was in a difficult situation.
Sitting close to me was a gentleman, who  was going to Hyderabad, India. His flight was scheduled for 10 p.m. I expressed my difficult and helpless situation to him. He then said to me, “Don’t worry, I will buy a ticket for you.”  To hear him say so, I was greatly relieved of my distress.  I thanked him for his great kind heart in trying to help me. I took his email address and phone number.
I asked him how much he had paid for the air ticket. He did not tell me. In the mean time, it was 10 p.m. and time for him to proceed towards the boarding gate.
As we parted from each other, I said, “Thank you very much, Pramod.” It was a miracle for me to come across such a kind-hearted man at the right time to help me.

282,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-vexed-expats/,"The government must take up the issue of visas for expats’ spouses seriously and try to resolve it in double quick time
An investment-friendly environment, apart from guarantee of returns on investments, is a must to lure foreign investment. And on the eve of the Nepal Investment Summit held earlier this year on March 29-30, the government went all out to introduce the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act (FITTA) in a bid to woo the maximum number of investors to Nepal. However, the act, introduced in haste without holding broad consultations with the stakeholders, has certain ambiguities that tend to vex expatriates living in Nepal. One such vexation has to do with the difficulty of bringing their spouses to Nepal. Officials at the Department of Industry acknowledge that quite few expats have already lodged complaints demanding simplification of the procedures that would allow their spouses to get visas easily. The existing provision could discourage skilled workers from coming to Nepal while also hindering the flow of foreign capital into the country. Despite the complaints, it seems there is little the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Section at the Department of Industry can do as it requires an amendment to the act itself, which will have to wait until the House of Representatives sits for the winter session.
FITTA repealed the Foreign Investment and Transfer of Technology Act 1992 to bring reform in the foreign investment regime in Nepal. FITTA was passed together with the Public Private Partnership Investment Act 2019, with the former designed for the safe repatriation of profits, and the latter for facilitation of investments in the country. The government had also introduced or amended a number of other laws aimed at attracting foreign investment in the country. They included the Industrial Enterprises Act and Special Economic Zone Act, among others. One of the features of FITTA is that it has provisioned a One-Stop Service Mechanism, which came into operation just weeks after the Nepal Investment Summit 2019, where the government had guaranteed “world class treatment, facilitation and service to investors”. What the one-stop service means to the investors, both Nepali and foreign, is that they will no longer have to visit different government agencies located at different places for registration, approval and other administration clearances to set up a business in the country. The centre has brought altogether 14 different government agencies involved in approving investments at one place. Their offices represent immigration, customs, labour, the central bank, environment ministry and industry ministry.
The government cannot, however, sit back in a complacent manner thinking it has done enough by introducing or amending laws to attract FDI. True, Nepal Investment Summit 2019 was a grand success, with both Nepali and foreign investors committing almost US$ 17.5 billion in various projects. However, how much of that pledge will be realised will depend on the working environment in Nepal. Even a small irritant could impede the flow of capital to this country. The government must take up the issue related to visas for expats’ spouses seriously and try to resolve it in double quick time.

Act swiftly
Banke district is facing a severe shortage of construction materials, such as stones, boulders and sand, leading to delay in construction of infrastructure projects. One of the major projects affected by lack of riverbed materials is Sikta Irrigation, a national pride project. This is not the first time construction of projects, considered crucial to stimulate economic growth, has been hit by a shortage of river-based resources. Earlier, the developer of Gautam Buddha International Airport faced the same problem, leading to months of delay in project construction. If this problem continues to recur, Nepal can never bridge the huge infrastructure gap required to put the economy on a higher growth trajectory.
It is, therefore, high time the federal government coordinated with the provincial and local governments to address this issue. Local governments must take the lead to resolve this problem, as they are the authorised body to provide permits to extract riverbed materials. Banke is facing a shortage of river-based resources because of delay made by Raptisonari Rural Municipality to award the contract. As a result, river-borne materials are being illegally excavated. This can cause serious harm to the environment. Local governments should take note of these repercussions and act swiftly.

So there are calls for integrating these laws into an umbrella Act to simplify the process
Nepal has made big strides in constitutional, electoral and legal reforms in the past several years. Following the promulgation of the new constitution in 2015, Nepal held a series of elections for all three tiers of governments – central, provincial and local level. Nepal follows a mixed model of election system, including First-Past-The-Post, Proportional Representation as well as Single Transferable Voting System. The country is currently experiencing transition to a federal democratic republic and is in the process of formulating hundreds of new laws in line with the new constitution.
At the centre of debate is reform in the electoral laws. Nepal presently has a set of 11 different Acts, 29 different Rules and over 80 Directives related to election.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
As such, there are over 100 laws that govern elections. The huge number of laws has meant that the process of election becomes difficult, tedious and confusing from the legal standpoint. Naturally, there are calls for integrating or codifying these laws into an umbrella Act to simplify the process.
In practical terms, the current system in Nepal has also led to several problems that often impede the holding of free, fair and independent elections. Political dominance in the appointment of the Election Commissioners, financial control by the executive, control of human resources by the executive and the power of declaring the election date in the executive have meant that the Election Commission of Nepal (ECN) is not as fully autonomous as is envisaged by the constitution.
Therefore, it is imperative for Nepal to undertake a series of reforms in electoral governance. After the series of elections in 2017, there is a stable government at the centre as well as in the provinces and the local levels.
Before the next round of elections in 2022, there is ample time to discuss and decide upon the new set of reforms. Nepal Law Society (NLS) has been supporting constitutional development, rule of law, an independent judiciary and electoral reforms since the last four decades.
In the past, the NLS was engaged in the observation of 11 elections, including parliamentary as well as local elections.
Against the backdrop of those observations, the NLS and other stakeholders have long felt the need to undertake reforms in election laws. In 2018, the NLS joined hands with the ECN and the IFES/USAID to explore the areas of reforms and identify the needs. The series of programs, interactions and studies have resulted in the following conclusions.
Widespread need has been felt by all the stakeholders – the government, ECN, Federal Parliament and civil society – about the need to reduce the number of election-related laws to make them better managed and simple to understand and execute with the ultimate aim of ensuring free and fair elections. In the elections held in 2017, there were several controversies and disputes regarding the application of election laws – such as in the registration of the electoral rolls, publication of ballot papers, vote counting procedure, delay in declaration of results as well as the implementation of the election code of conduct. In short, we have concluded that in order to overcome the aforementioned obstacles, Nepal should have just two major elections laws – an Act related to the ECN and an Integrated Act on Election.
To integrate the several election-related provisions into a codified law, a group of 10 election and drafting experts are currently working to give final shape to the two laws. The ECN is also closely involved in guiding the team of experts so that the laws are tailor-made.
The proposed reforms in the draft include reforms in all three phases – pre-election, during election and post-election. In the pre-election phase, the draft proposes that election programmes be announced at least three months in advance; that the power to declare the election date as well as administer election officials and control finances be given to the commission; stringent power to the ECN to enforce the code of conduct; and stringent provisions to regulate the political financing of the elections by making transactions through banks compulsory.
Likewise, it proposes reform to ensure that all voters who reach 18 years of age on the election date are included. It proposes reforms in the selection of polling centres and ensuring that they are gender- and disabled-friendly. The draft also proposes providing power to the ECN to strictly enforce the constitutional provision regarding the quotas for women and other minorities.
During election, the draft proposes easing transport and movement during the day; ensuring accessible polling centres; and power to the Returning Officer to declare the polling void in case of any undue activities. In the post-election period, the draft proposes laws allowing immediate vote-counting in the polling centres and declaration of results.
It also proposes the practice of allowing No Vote or None of the Above (NOTA). It also allows for laws permitting voting by eligible Nepalis living overseas. The new proposed reforms
can bring about massive changes in the practice of holding free and fair elections in Nepal, as well as in the whole of the South Asian region, in the coming days.

284,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/contextual-learning/,"“Can education be obtained only in school?” This was a question I had put to the seventh graders. They said that they could also gain knowledge from friends, their mistakes and difficult situations. They got me exactly right. I have always believed that learning could happen anywhere. My one and only purpose to go to school as a child was to read and write. My sources of learning were the different situations, people and their behaviour, environment and friends.
In the rapidly changing world, the roles of schools and teachers are extended. Parents’ expectations have also doubled. But also, if anyone thinks that lessons can be only learnt in school, they are wrong. As a mother or father, you are the first teacher for them.
Last month, I was going to Putalisadak from Pepsicola in a taxi with my nine-year-old son. As soon as it picked up speed, the driver started a casual conversation. When we reached Tinkune, he told us about the overnight makeover of the place. Since it was a day before Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit, the place was being spruced up. The sight of different types of vehicles for cleaning tickled my son’s fancy. The driver was willingly explaining about them to my son. It was
at Baneswor that my son inquired about a torn flex hoarding along the roadside. “Why do people destroy public property instead of maintaining it?” he enquired, sounding like a very aware citizen.
In the mean time, the driver was also talking about how China had developed. From Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin, he had good knowledge about world politics, but seemed to
be annoyed by the country’s political situation. When we reached Maitighar, we saw people busy placing flower pots around the Mandala. Seeing this, he expressed his disapproval of the government making haste at the eleventh hour.
After we got off, we met my mother and sister. It was then that I realised how inspiring that travel had been for my son. No sooner had he met his aunt than he started sharing all that he had learnt from the taxi driver. For a moment, my sister was surprised to see how knowledgeable he was.
What he learnt was contextual learning. Thanks to that person who became a teacher for a moment. I am pretty sure the lesson will remain in his
memory throughout life. In life anyone can teach you lessons, regardless of one’s profession. Learning can take place anywhere.

285,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-for-greater-activism/,"The local school is a good place for intervention, where an appropriate curriculum could help create awareness among the students
The Supreme Court may have made chhaupadi illegal as early as 2006, but that has not prevented the death of more than a dozen women and girls in two districts of Sudurpaschim Province alone in the past one decade. The chhaupadi is a tradition that banishes women to a chhau, or menstruation shed, outside the home during the period. The most recent one to die was Parbati Budha Rawat, 21, in Safebagar Municipality in Achham district of far-west Nepal on Monday. As many as 14 women are said to have died in Achham district in the last 10 years while a mother and her two young sons died of suffocation in nearby Bajura. These are cases that have been reported in the media, and the actual number of women who have died in a chhau shed could be much, much higher, according to women rights activists.
It is inhumane to leave a menstruating woman alone in a shed, where there are chances of her dying of suffocation, snake bite, animal attacks and fires. Those forcing women and girls to live in a chhau face a three-month jail term and fine, but this has not deterred households from keeping the chhaupadi alive. Its belief is so ingrained in society that even legislation and campaigns by both governmental and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have failed to make people see reason. The chhaupadi tradition is not pervasive across Nepal, and is found only in a few districts of mid-west and far-west Nepal. But doing away with the chhaupadi is proving more difficult than envisaged earlier, even though women rights activists have been at it for more than two decades now.
Greater activism by the government, NGOs and society will be needed to put an end to the harsh tradition. At the forefront of this activism should be placed the ward offices, with their elected representatives and government officials, as they are in constant contact with the local people. The local
governments have been empowered with 22 rights, and it is only right they be allowed to take the initiative to tackle the chhaupadi also. Addressing the cause of the problem, namely the ingrained psyche of the people, should help in abolishing the chhaupadi. The local school is a good place for intervention, where an appropriate curriculum could be
introduced to create awareness among the students. The message would automatically reach a wider
audience through them. For this, the teachers, a by-product of the society, would need to change first, and this could be done through an orientation. The FM radio is another powerful tool in disseminating information. Unlike in the past, FM radio stations are widely distributed across the country today and could be used to bring change in the perception of the local people. A visible campaign in the form of banners and flex boards at places and stickers on vehicles should be just as effective in raising the consciousness of the society. If we want concrete results, the activism should not be limited to a few pocket areas, as has been the modus operandi of the NGOs. A holistic approach targeting all the affected districts should reap rich dividends sooner than later.

Education for all
Margeshwori Primary School in Dhankuta has long been facing problems in running classes for children with disabilities due to lack of adequate classrooms and expert teachers. Making a bad situation worse, Dhankuta Municipality has not released funds to the school yet though eight months have passed since the academic session started. The school management has also been demanding a special training session for the teachers. Neither the municipal authority nor the District Education Office seems serious in addressing the genuine concerns of the school management in time. While children with disabilities have very low rates of initial enrolment, they are more likely to drop out and leave school early without transitioning to secondary or higher secondary level because of exclusion or segregation.
The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRCPD) requires states to provide reasonable accommodation for individual students to enable them to access an inclusive education. As a signatory to the UNCRPD, Nepal must put such a system in the local levels, respecting the right to education of children with disabilities. Our education system must be equally accessible to every student regardless of their physical or mental abilities.

The provision of good public transport could also help bring down wear and tear significantly due to lesser number of vehicles on the streets
A fleeting glance through the roads of Nepal invariably reveals a maze of potholes, which have been something of an eyesore for all alike. At one time, the Pathlaiya-Birgunj road was so damaged that it appeared more like a field than a road, and people even planted rice to attract the attention of the government but to no avail. The prime ministers time and again in the past have issued directives to cover them up at different times. Prime Minister Oli has again drawn the attention of his concerned ministry towards them after the cabinet reshuffle, giving four months to cover them up.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
The history of the roads goes back to times immemorial in this part of the world. Ramayan speaks of very beautiful roads in the erstwhile Ravana-reigned golden Lanka. In Buddha’s times, around 7th century BC, two roads — Uttara Pantha, or north bound, and Daxina Pantha, or south bound, existed in India. The north-bound road linked Nepal with the rest of the Indian subcontinent. It passed through Punjab, Rajasthan, Malawa, Mathura, then Panchal and Bideha and Magadh. This road is said to be 1,156 kilometres long, and it had a milestone every kilometre. The Vedic cities primarily consisted of three north-south and three east-west roads. Their echoes, however faint, can still be seen in several cities in the Kathmandu Valley and glaringly in Patan:  the north-south bound roads being the Thapathali-Jawalakhel, Sankhamul-Lagankhel and Balkumari-Lagankhel roads and the east-west roads being the Pulchowk-Gwarko, Lagankhel-Sukuldhoka and Patan Dhoka-Balkumari roads.
Despite having such a long tradition of road buildings dating back to the mythical era, our highways are more of a hole-ways in view of the alcoves existing on their surface. An Unidentified Flying Object, with a moon landing campaign, mistakenly stepping in Nepal like Columbus landing in America in the quest of doing so in India may chant eureka as did Archimedes after solving the problem given by King Hiero II in view of the crater-like ditches on Nepali roads.
The condition of the roads has been dismal in other countries as well, but they were more so in the past than in the present. Chicago roads in 1910 lacked signage, stoplights, or crosswalks. Custom regulated the flow of traffic, not signage, and the most basic rule—keep to the right—often went unheeded. Pedestrians stood in the middle of the roadways to wait for arriving streetcars, crossing wherever they saw fit. Horse-drawn vehicles slowed the movement of streetcars, and drivers loaded and unloaded cargo wherever convenient. Horses also died on the streets—about 5,000 died in 1909 alone—which would cause delays until the Bureau of Streets removed the carcasses. But that was a century ago.
A Road Board was established in 2002 to provide sustainable funds for planned maintenance of roads with the objective of keeping the roads in serviceable condition. But scarce resources and the involvement of too many agencies in what is known as too many cooks spoiling the broth have been the twin problems. The annual budget required for the maintenance of roads in Nepal is Rs 85 billion, but it received only Rs 8 billion from the government in the year 2016/17. This budget has defied the laws of change by remaining unchanged this financial year even after four years when the total budget almost doubled to Rs 1,532 billion from Rs 819 billion in 2016/17. The annual extension of the road length by around 6.5 per cent further aggravates this funding problem. The Road Board works with different road agencies, one of which is the Roads Department. Its main responsibility is to look after strategic road networks. Besides, the Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Rural Roads, under the Ministry of Local Development, looks after the urban, district and local roads by coordinating with the District Development Committees and municipalities. For this, it has to work hand in glove with the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works.
Even though the budget allocated to the Road Boards is miniscule in size, the provision of Rs 163 billion for road infrastructure in the current year’s budget is quite significant as it comes to 10 per cent of the total budget of 1,532 billion. India in 2018 allocated Indian Rs 74,000 crores for the Ministry of Roads, which comes to only 2.5per cent of the total budget of 2,920,484 crores. It is then clear that the road users will have to pay in order to enjoy good road services. This can be done through the medium of toll roads. The other way can be the provision of good public transport, which will bring down wear and tear significantly due to lesser number of vehicles plying on the streets.
The Federal government should act as a facilitator, the provincial government as an implementer and the local government as an operator in this regard as we see in neighbouring India. But the actors forming the trinity appear to be involved in the blame game and at times even at daggers drawn to each other than coordinating properly. This has put the newly adopted Federal System in a crisis as the provincial government, though an important player, appears to be in the back bench more than in the field. This is also one of the main reasons for the inability to spend the developmental budget. If this continues, the potholes will only widen further.

287,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/joyrides-with-grandpa/,"Sitting in a lavish car with your eyes glued to the mobile screen does not give you the same pleasure as of riding on the back of your grandfather does. When his head covers the best part of your chest and you see through the silver hair – the world with its varied hues. The aerial view sends frequent chills down the spine as you hover around the passers-by and automobiles. The chit chat remains the only constant with the continuously changing scene around.
I still vividly remember such adventurous rides with my grandfather, especially during the festive season. He would make me mount his shoulders and take me to the market to buy groceries. While he meticulously chose the household items, I would drool over the sumptuous candies and chocolates on the glass shelves. At the billing counter, the shop owner would pinch me on my cheek and offer a mango candy, and I would reciprocate with a hearty smile. From there we would go to buy vegetables. The scene at the vegetable market had a peculiar fascination for me. The vendors splashing water on the showcased vegetables to keep them fresh gave me immense joy. After a great deal of negotiation with the vendors and filling our cotton carry bags, we would retire to our home.
Out of all these, my all-time favourite was the shopping for Diwali. Grandpa used to buy me sugary toys, sweets and clothes. On the way, he would stop by the sugarcane juice shop for a refreshing drink.
There was so much of emotion and belongingness in these rides. The chatter while plodding the road was no less than life changing philosophical lessons, capable of stirring lives. I was exposed to a variety of disciplines, which included History, Literature, Philosophy and, most importantly, Ethics. Courtesy to these shoulder rides, I got to know so much about our ancestral family’s forced migration from Pakistan to India, Lord Rama’s victory over Ravana, basic tenets of life and the role of moral values in one’s life. Had I not been privileged to enjoy the Augustus company of my grandparents, I would not have developed this insight and my intellect would certainly have been dormant.
I owe a great deal to my grandpa for acquainting me with the life outside. And on the contrary, I feel pity for the millennial for being deprived of the joy rides we used to have. They may have more luxuries at their disposal but they indubitably miss out on the innocence and originality of life.

288,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/transitional-justice-truth-is-its-foundation/,"Transitional justice is a challenge by which we test ourselves, our vision of the future and the kind of society we want to build out of the rubble of the decade of conflict
They say that ‘you live and learn’. What does it take for a society to learn about the importance of truth? The whole foundation of transitional justice (TJ) is the truth. Based on that truth, we remember what actually happened here in our country. Based on that truth, we bring justice and reparations and remedy to those who have suffered, victims and survivors.  Based on that truth, we reform and improve our institutions and practices to reduce the chances of that kind of disaster happening to us once again.
I want to look at what happened on November 21, 2006 – when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed – through the prism of the truth and hope it can be a learning experience. I apologise in advance if I offend anyone, but clearly in Nepal today, the truth is inconvenient to some. But without the truth, we will be condemned to go around in circles like a dog or a bear on a short chain, which first gets angry and then goes mad.
Before I begin my diary of November 21, let me just make one thing clear; transitional justice is a great and inevitable opportunity for us to learn from the past to make a better future. It is not a gesture of revenge but a signpost of hope for all of us. It is not an obstacle on our path towards stability and prosperity; it is that path! TJ is a challenge by which we test ourselves, our vision of the future and the kind of society we want to build out of the rubble of the decade of conflict. Everyone, including our leaders and diplomatic friends, must understand this.
Remembrance is the least we can offer to honour our dead, tortured, all our victims. But only the victims and civil society chose to remember the 13th anniversary of our rediscovery of peace. If the victims hadn’t organised events and journalists marked the day, it would have passed in silence, buried like the 17,000 of our compatriots who will never see another anniversary.
We will never know what positions politicians took on TJ during the CPA negotiations in 2006 as it all took place in private, behind closed doors, without civil society’s participation, no women, just high-caste men drinking whiskey in smoky rooms. But from now, we can insist that there will be transparency and the truth.  They all now claim to have constantly defended the truth process even if the experience of the 13 years could make us doubt this from all of them.
Our peace process is a great event in our history, and we must cherish it and keep it alive.  But we must examine it with the truth. Let us not forget that in April last year, at the request of our political leaders, an embassy in Kathmandu brought a secret political mission from Colombia in the hope of finding a magic solution to the issue of TJ, that is, how to make it go away with no political damage, with no custodial sentences. But the Colombians who were brought, in wisdom and honesty, told our leaders that there is no secret to their negotiations. In disgust, our leaders sent them back to South America.

Since 2014, the Supreme Court had clearly said what changes needed to be made to the TJ Act to make it conform to our laws. The UN did the same with regard to international law. Our politicians have had five years to bring an amendment, but nothing has happened.  The previous commissions failed in part due to lack of supporting legislation. Now our leaders say ‘trust us’, this time the commissions will work.  But we have been saying for years that we need the amendment before the appointments, and then participation of civil society in the selections, as per international standards. ‘Trust us,’ they said when they set up a selection committee and then prevented it from doing its work until the decision had been fixed by the leaders in private meetings. Why should we trust any new commissions when it is clear we cannot even trust the selection committee?
Here are my truths: transitional justice is unavoidable, but it cannot happen until the civil society and, in particular, the victims have trust in the process. That trust can only come with transparency on the part of the leaders and genuine participation in the process for victims and human rights groups. The arguments our leaders put forward on November 21 might have worked in 2006, but after 13 years of disappointments and deception, they no longer hold in 2019.
One thing our leaders agree on is that they do not want Universal Jurisdiction, international justice, but they forget that this only ever happens when national measures have failed or there is no political will amongst the politicians and the judiciary.  It is the same with the TJ.  Thus we have only two alternatives: Set up a people’s truth process, to allow an agreed version of what happened to come out through victims’ testimonies. Second, call for international help, which basically means UN expertise. Victims are tired of being lied to, and our leaders risk paying the price due to loss of credibility.
The eyes of the world are on Nepal, and most people want us to succeed. The longer the TJ process remains stuck in the mud, the more we will look like a nation which doesn’t know what it wants, what direction we are seeking. Not just the international human rights community, but potential investors will not be encouraged if we do not show clear determination to tell the truth about the past and learn lessons that allow us to strengthen the rule of law.

289,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/intellects-block/,"Like the writer’s block, today I faced an intellect’s block. I found myself being so attached to past events that I couldn’t think of the present or the future. Thus I couldn’t move forward.
As a writer needs creativity so an intellect needs power and true knowledge to move on. It needs answers to the questions of why, what and how.  As I was figuring out the answer to why, suddenly I felt like why not share this state of blocked intellect with others! The moment I got this thought, my blocked intellect got unblocked.
I looked back to the past and found myself stuck and passing through the tunnel of darkness of the intellect. What helped me to come out of it?  The only answer I got was – creation of a new topic for a column. So far, whatever I have imbibed needs to be shared with others. There might be lot of people who are going through this block. Well, the true natural nature of the soul is giving, sharing the treasure of experience and knowledge.
Nowadays I find a wave of advertising and marketing through sharing of experiences to promote business. Whether it is public speaking, sales or art, they are attracting lots of customers online. Ninety minutes of webinar followed by heavy discounts, including the best take away experiences to expand the business.
Giving means growing. But what is growth?  Spiritually, whatever the intellect has learnt needs to come out in the form of action. If the action is pure, it inspires others to follow it. Pure action ignites the spark of the soul by activating a particular specialty. Suddenly there is a powerful and determined thought backed by zeal and enthusiasm to make it happen. I remember once my colleague took notes in Urdu.  It was so beautiful that I was determined to learn the script in one month. That moment was one of the wow moments of my life.  Impossible became possible and easy.  I found myself easily reading short stories in Urdu.
Intellects’ block is nothing but a sign to look into other areas to explore and experiment.  It’s a call to broaden your intellect with new learnings and experiences. Like we need variety in food, the same way intellect needs variety in the form of knowledge to imbibe and churn.  The more the intellect churns and digests new things, the more activated, creative and innovative it becomes.
The next time when faced with intellects’ block, understand it as a call for change of food for the intellect.

290,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/accessibility-for-inclusion-for-those-living-with-disabilities/,"The universal design concept asserts that anything and everything should be designed in order to be accessible not only to people with diverse disabilities, but more generally to the broadest possible spectrum of humanity
Each year, on December 3, the world marks International Day of People with Disabilities (IDPD) It is a day on which we promote public awareness about the challenges faced by people with disabilities, and the role communities and societies can play in eradicating the barriers to social inclusion. The theme for this year’s IDPD is “Promoting the participation of persons with disabilities and their leadership: taking action on the 2030 Development Agenda” while the national theme is “The Future is Accessible”, which means we all look towards a future without barriers.

More than one billion people live with some form of disability worldwide. In the years ahead, disability will be an even greater concern due to ageing population and the higher risk of disability in older people as well as the global increase in chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders. Understandably, people with disabilities have poorer health outcomes, lower education feats, less economic contribution and higher rates of poverty than people without them.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) came into force in 2008 and strengthened the understanding of disability as a human rights and development priority.
A person’s environment has a huge impact on the magnitude of disability. Inaccessible environments create disability by creating hurdles to participation and inclusion. Examples of the possible negative impact of the environment are a deaf person without a sign language interpreter, a wheelchair user in a building without an accessible toilet and a blind person using a computer lacking screen-reading software. The environment could be changed to improve health conditions, prevent impairments, and improve outcomes for people with disabilities. Such changes can be fetched by legisla¬tion, policy changes, capacity building, or tech¬nological developments.
Article 9 of the UNCRPD cherishes “accessibility” as one of the treaty’s eight general principles. In the preamble of the Convention, we learn that accessibility is closely tied to the evolving definition of disability. The universal design concept asserts that anything and everything should be designed in order to be accessible not only to people with diverse disabilities, but more generally to the broadest possible spectrum of humanity. For example, public buildings designed with ramps at entranceways allow for the easy movement of persons with mobility disabilities, along with pregnant women; parents with a baby carriage; people with injuries; and older persons. In the same way, for information accessibility, television programmes with subtitles and voice over ensure accessibility to people with hearing impairment as well as those watching in a noisy setting.
The Sustainable Development Goals have a strong and explicit focus on disability, promulgating a socially just and human rights-based approach where development efforts include all people, even those at the very margin of the society. The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs are both evidently inclusive of people with disabilities. They can be used as an advocacy tool to draw the attention of decision-makers for the creation of disability-inclusive policies and programmes.
Following Nepal’s ratification of the CRPD in 2010, the country has made notable progress in the disability sector. In 2015, Nepal adopted a democratic and an inclusive constitution, which assured a comprehensive set of rights for people with disabilities, with special provisions to ensure their access to health care, education, social justice and proportionate representation in the local bodies.
The Disability Rights Act 2017, which swapped the Disabled Persons Welfare Act 1982, made a vital departure from the welfare-based approach to the rights-based approach to disability. The Act acknowledges the principles on which the CRPD was established, and amplifies the definition of persons with disabilities in line with the Convention, eliminating and banning offensive narratives.
Why is there a need for disability awareness? Simply, disability is not mainstreamed and is often overlooked. Only a few people with disabilities know their rights, and deeply rooted stereotypes towards people with disabilities still exist. Civil servants must make policies to ensure there is more than just nominal representation of people with disabilities in politics.
Within the legal and policy frameworks, governments should engage the civil society and private entities in implementing initiatives to tackle inequalities of accessibility. Engaging people with disabilities throughout all stages of design, development and deployment safeguards access to products and services. This, in turn, can reduce costs and serve wider markets.
The CRPD calls on States Parties to take measures on accessibility not only for government-owned facilities and services, but also in the private sector. In the federal structure, the measures should be designed in consultation with people with disabilities, disabled people’s organisations and their networks, such as the National Federation of the Disabled, Nepal. This will help to break the brutal barriers and open up better opportunities for disability-inclusive development.

291,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-time-for-goods-delivery/,"With the by-elections over, the government must now concentrate its efforts on goods and service delivery to the people
The results of the by-elections held on November 30 send a clear message that the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and the Nepali Congress are the predominant forces at all levels in Nepal, and the smaller parties or independents have little chance of shaking them. Kaski Constituency 2 was the focus of the by-elections, where Bidhya Bhattarai of the NCP, the wife of late Rabindra Adhikari, won the polls with a huge margin of votes against her rival from the Nepali Congress. The seat had fallen vacant after Adhikari, who was the tourism minister, was killed in a chopper crash in Taplejung in east Nepal in February this year. Although some smaller parties, such as the Samajbadi Party Nepal and Sajha Party, managed to win some votes in the election held on Saturday, they were few and trailing far behind the big parties. What is particularly embarrassing is that 19 candidates failed to garner even a single vote, most of whom were contesting the polls as independents. A candidate from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (United) also failed to win a single vote for the chair of ward No. 10 of Kapilvastu. What this points to is that the principles and programmes of these smaller parties do not resonate well with the voters, requiring a total change of tactics in future elections.
The by-elections on Saturday were held in 37 districts for 52 vacant posts. They were held to elect one member of the House of Representatives, three provincial assembly members from Bhaktapur, Baglung and Dang, one mayor in Dharan, three chairpersons, one vice-chair and 43 ward chairs. Altogether 11 parties had fielded candidates for the lone parliamentary seat, 15 parties for the provincial assembly seats and 20 parties for the local levels. Of the 337 candidates contesting the by-elections, 253 represented various political parties while 84 were independents. The polls, despite some sporadic incidents of bomb blasts, were largely peaceful, with 65.43 per cent voter turnout, although the Election Commission was expecting about 70 per cent.
With the victory of Bidhya Bhattarai in the by-election, the NCP retains the same number of seats in the parliament as before. The Nepali Congress, however, managed to wrest the Bhaktapur seat in the provincial assembly from the NCP and won the mayoral seat in Dharan, considered a NCP stronghold. But elections are unpredictable, and they throw up surprises even with the best of predictions. With the elections over, the government is relieved of a major task, especially when there are inimical forces trying to sabotage any democratic exercise in the country. The government must now concentrate its efforts on goods and service delivery to the people. Regardless of any election, the reason why people vote is that they want the government to deliver the goods. And it can only do this when it can spend its capital expenditure in time. Unfortunately, the central government’s capital expenditure in the first quarter of the current fiscal year hovers at around just 6 per cent. The government has the onus to build the infrastructure for creating millions of jobs for our youths, who leave the country by the horde every day to do menial jobs in some foreign land. Let those who were elected in the past or in the by-elections on Saturday not disappoint their voters.

Cancer risks
It’s already unfortunate to be infected with HIV. Now there is more bad news for people living with HIV – they are at risk of cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma, which sees the growth of abnormal tissue in the skin, mouth, nose and throat. People with HIV are also susceptible to lung cancer, cervical cancer and lymphoma, a cancer that starts in the cells of the body’s immune system. According to doctors, HIV weakens the immune system, reducing the body’s ability to fight viral infections, which could lead to cancer.
There is a need to create awareness about HIV/AIDS among the people, especially in the rural areas, to prevent infection as well as diseases as a result of it. Nepal is said to have about 31,000 persons living with HIV, and this gives room for worry as HIV infection could spread fast through multiple means. Most of those suffering from HIV/AIDS are injecting drug users, commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men and transgender people. Also a lot of migrant male workers are known to buy sex when outside, which raises the possibility of infecting their wives upon their return. Working with these groups of people should help contain HIV to some degree.

292,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/my-feathered-friends/,"Early morning after a brief workout I was lying flat on my back, trying to practise a little mindful awareness. Just then I heard a soft sound like stealthy footsteps in my smallish room. It was not exactly dark. Moreover, there’s nothing in my room except books. Just then the sound repeated itself. And what did I see? The trespasser was a beautiful baby bird. In a flash it flew past me, out of the balcony door, into the blue beyond.
On certain holidays, when I’m late waking up, this sound—a clatter of wings followed by a distant cooing – brings me into awareness. I don’t initially see anything except, occasionally, a flash of white, a streak of feathers, but I know it’s a pigeon. My wife then gets to the roof with a packet of wheat. Watching them eat in a group makes me forget my own gnawing entrails.
A couple of years ago, I went to visit the Bengal Dooars. Early morning that day as I emerged out of the hotel room at Jaldapara Inn and stood on the gravel path, I heard the dawn chorus. The car was getting ready to take us to the Jaldapara Reserve forest entry point. Just then, a call I never heard before, sonorous yet melancholic sounded very close to where I was standing. The moment it stopped I felt a pang within. When I got into the car and left the hotel, I was wondering whether I could hear this birdcall again.
I heard the call again after a few hours at South Khayerbari, a Royal Bengal Tiger and Leopard Reserve Centre, about 15 km from Jaldapara. I went on a birdcall recording spree: of the mesmerising four-note call (Bo-Ko-Ta-Ko) of the Bou-Katha-kau (Bride, please speak), the Indian Cuckoo, not to be confused with the Common-Hawk cuckoo, the guide there told me.
Our next destination was Murti. Here you find vast stretches of land, most of which lies fallow, framed by mist-laden hills beyond. And in this open, silent place, how this birdcall, known as ‘the soul of dead shepherd’ calling for its lost sheep, sounded. A brainfever bird (Common Hawk-Cuckoo) hovered continuously over the scape peeping and tweeting in a wailing tone. It must have been looking for its lost mate.
The Indian Cuckoo (Cuculus Micropterus) is a lone bird, whose call is usually not returned by another of its kind. It is very shy and solitary, perches itself at the crown of leafy trees, and hides from the casual gazers. There are other trills, that of a nightingale, or of a lark, which lift the human mood instantly.

293,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/tia-immigration-and-vny-2020-making-services-swifter/,"Our diplomatic missions have a role in disseminating information about the visa procedures at our airport to prevent unexpected hassles. Unfortunately, tourists cannot make online payment for the visa fee at the airport
Nepal is gearing up to celebrate Visit Nepal Year 2020 (VNY 2020) and hopes to welcome the targetted two million tourists during the year. Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) is the only major gateway for tourists and has the obligatory mandate to provide quick and competent service so that a newcomer enters Nepal with positive vibes and excitement. All of us know that our only international airport is the first impression of our country, which a tourist first sets deep in his or her mind. The immigration office is never unaware of this fact.
However, some tourists complain about the hectic procedure, congestion and unexpected hassles at the TIA immigration. No doubt, sometimes problems may arise due to lack of our effective system or management. But many tourists find themselves in trouble due to their own carelessness, lack of precautions and proper information. Most of the complications tourists face at the immigration revolve around application or payment procedure. When a tourist lands and enters the immigration, s/he must first apply for a visa with the help of a kiosk machine. The second step is to pay the visa fee at the collection counter. During the peak season, s/he may have to go through a long queue, once to apply, then to pay the visa fee and finally while proceeding towards the desk of the immigration officer to get the visa. The problem worsens when some machines abruptly stop working or when the visitor does not carry cash and tries to pay with a credit card, but it does not work in the machines available at the bank counter. Some tourists coming via India have to grasp the nettle when they have no currency other than Indian. Finally, with the limited number of desks open, it is a long way to the immigration desk. These could be problems with some tourists during the peak seasons.

The airport immigration has been suffering from a shortage of officers, and due to this perennial problem, some desks remain closed. An immigration officer can do no more than enhance the work pace only by a little.
Furthermore, the officer cannot overlook the risk posed by suspicious passengers and fraudulent documents while trying to work fast. We don’t have eGates or a biometric system to screen and clear the passengers confidently and on a massive scale.
One thing that prevents us from being efficient is associated with the technology available. The terribly slow network/internet and unreliable power back-up system, even in a sensitive office like immigration, are not new problems. Abrupt interruption even for a minute, for instance, when big jets land within short intervals of time, could send crowds of passengers in the immigration area, which itself is choking with congestion.
We don’t have and don’t expect to have as consistent and reliable technology or system devoid of any flaws as the developed countries. The immigration office alone cannot be better than the condition and level of development of a country, although work at the TIA immigration office these days is far better than in previous times. The airport immigration is undergoing reform in its hardware as well as its software system. We are hoping for dramatic reforms, as our department is working day and night, keeping in mind Visit Nepal Year 2020. And with the operation of another international airport from the third month of 2020, as assured by the minister of the Tourism Ministry, most of the problems, including the one of congestion, might get resolved. Apart from these, some minor precautions on the part of the tourists and some small initiatives by the government could help tourists get easy entrance through the TIA immigration.
First, to make VNY 2020 a success, the government has to make optimum use of diplomatic missions and representatives abroad. Most of the tourists visit as organised groups, facilitated by an international tour company or travel agency. The diplomatic missions and representatives abroad can coordinate, facilitate and share ideas with such companies or agents to escape the hassle at the TIA immigration.  Tourists have the choice of getting their visa from the diplomatic missions abroad before visiting Nepal. Getting the entry permit in the visa already issued is always cozier and swifter than getting a visa on arrival. Nonetheless, if they need to get a visa on arrival, they can at least apply online through online.nepalimmigration.gov.np before leaving for Nepal. The ones who land with an application can directly proceed towards the bank counter of the immigration area.
The diplomatic missions and representatives have a major role in disseminating such information about the visa procedures at our airport and share the best ideas to avoid the unexpected hassles. Unfortunately, tourists do not have the option of making online payment for the visa fee at the airport. In this regard, I urge the higher authority to introduce an online payment system sooner than later.
Finally, the government has to think seriously about supplying uninterruptible, high speed, reliable networking and power back-up system at the immigration. Furthermore, the immigration officials should be given some sort of incentive plans so as to retain as well as to motivate them to work even in adverse conditions and have all counters operate in a full-fledged manner.

294,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-dont-delay-nia/,"Nijgadh is the most suitable place for a full-fledged international airport, and there is no point in delaying it any further
Nepal’s only international airport – Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) – must count itself lucky that two airports, at Bhairahawa and Pokhara, will be ready soon to cater to international flights involving big jets. With just one runway for both take off and landing and limited parking lots, TIA is congested beyond measure, and is badly in need of a big airport to ease the overcrowding of planes. Soon after multi-party democracy was ushered into the country in 1990, plans had been floated for the construction of a second international airport at Nijgadh, in Simra to the south of Kathmandu. But more than two decades have passed in preparing the detailed project report (DPR) and talking about how to save the environment. Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai had given assurances that the foundation stone of the Nijgadh International Airport (NIA) would be laid in mid-December this year, with the firm belief that begun is half done. But a quarterly report of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) has revealed that quite a few preparations require completing before its construction can begin in earnest.
The most important condition for the airport’s construction is site clearance. Although the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has prepared the framework for site clearance, it has yet to receive a nod from the Ministry of Forests and Environment to cut down the trees. To be built in the midst of a dense jungle, the airport would require cutting massive number of trees – said to be anywhere between 200,000 and 760,000 – which has created quite a furore among environmentalists. The government has also not decided on the construction modality. There are three options, namely, G2G (government to government), PPP (public, private partnership) and BOOT (build, own, operate and transfer). Compensation to those households that have been affected by the airport’s construction is yet to be sorted out, although it is said to be in its final stage. And then there is the task of resettling those squatters who inhabit the construction area.
Twenty-five years is a lot of time to take for planning, and it is not good to keep the airport’s construction lingering under one pretext or the other. Nijgadh has shown to be the most suitable place for a full-fledged international airport, and there is no point in delaying it any further as it will invite more problems and cost over-runs. The airport to occupy 8,000 hectares of land is to be developed in three phases as an international hub – an air transit for 22 neighbouring countries – capable of handling 15 million air passengers per year. This will make Nijgadh International Airport one of the largest in south Asia. Imagine what this entails for the future of the Nepali economy .  At the recent investment summit in Kathmandu, a few countries had shown interest in constructing the airport, which will cost about half a billion dollars in the first phase, and a total of US$ 6.5 billion when it is fully completed. But before any firm can come and start work, Nepal must do the basic work of clearing the site and deciding on the construction modality.

Take action
Government offices are known for their lethargic pace of work, with the employees having no fear of being taken to task for it. Absenteeism without leave is routine, which delays work in government offices. The secure job that the government employees enjoy perhaps explains their often unruly behaviour. During a surprise monitoring and inspection carried out by the National Vigilance Centre (NVC) from November 17 to 22, as many as 150 employees were found absent from various government offices and municipalities while 108 had not donned the prescribed uniform during office hours. The number would be many times more if the NVC were able to carry out such monitoring in all the offices.
It is the duty of every government office to keep tab of its employees during office hours and see to it that they do not go astray. The civil servants are also bound by the regulations to wear the prescribed uniform so that they can be identified by the service-seekers, and they receive money annually from the government to buy new uniform. The indiscipline seen in the government offices is largely an offshoot of the union politics that influences the overall environment there. It would be good to bring its sway under control sooner than later.

295,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/first-trip-to-a-dance-bar/,"It was my first trip to Bombay, now Mumbai, in the mid-1990s. I imagined that it would be as glam and flashy as in the movies. It was far from it. Our Durbar Marg then was more classy, sophisticated and sublime than any streets in Mumbai. No wonder, while on their holidays to Kathmandu, affluent Indian tourists would leave their gilded cages – five-star hotels – to stroll in the dust-free, crisp Durbar Marg in the evening. Sadly, Durbar Marg today has lost the old-world charm and could be any garish street in the corners of Mumbai.
One thing good about Indians is they are friendly. A few days in Mumbai, and I already had a large group of friends. Dinner invitations started flowing in, and we would invariably dine at  Nariman Point, Cuffee Parade, Pedder Road or Gateway of India.
One day, one of my friends asked: “Have you been to a dance bar yet?” I told him I did not fancy dance bars much as I had been to go-go bars in Bangkok many times. He said: “You should see it once. “ So one evening, off we went to a dance bar. Nothing remarkable about the place. It was seedier than sleazy. I was expecting the dance bar to be something like in the movies and dancers to be like yesteryear’s heartthrob: Helen. The girls were all dressed up in saris and salwar-kameez. Growing up watching Helen dance in the movies, I imagined the bar to be all glam and flash. It was far from it.
As we sat down, my host handed me a packet of 10-rupee notes. I looked at him askance. He told me I should give away money to the girls when they come to the table. The girls would step out from their floor and go to the table that they like to pull out the money from between the customers ‘ fingers or lips. Some customers would tease them playfully before letting the money go. Many of them were throwing money all over. One man went closer to the dance floor and started emptying his bagful of money before he went out happily.
Meanwhile, a customer tried to create a ruckus by insisting on joining the girls on the dance floor. The staff asked him politely to step back and not disturb the girls at work.
But after some time he ran into the floor. The girls were dancing nonchalantly. The staff cautioned him against trying the stunt again. Some people cannot control their excitement at such places. Years later, dance bar sprouted in Kathmandu like wild weeds.

296,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/democratic-decision-making-learning-from-honeybee-democracy/,"Honeybees make decisions without the queen telling them what to do. However, in our political system, the leaders are expected to take all the decisions, and are criticised if they fail to do so
Democratic decision-making is an appealing idea being advocated by all the major political parties and other actors in Nepal. In the preamble of Nepal’s constitution, it is stated that we are committed to socialism based on democratic norms and values, including the people’s competitive multi-party democratic system of governance. It is, however, quite common that decisions are often made without participation and due consultation with the concerned stakeholders.

Honeybees are referred in a number of political discourses, such as ‘busy as a honeybee’ and ‘defend as bees do with wasps’. This article highlights how honeybees take decisions and whether their organisational system and decision- making process can help us bring positive changes in our decision-making.
Honeybees are known to us as social insects, as they work together and store honey in their combs, much more than they actually need to survive. And, humans have prized these small creatures since ancient times. Honeybees have a clear division of tasks (cleaning of hive, brood caring, defending, nectar and pollen collection, processing and storage) based on age, caste (worker, drone and queen) and need. The Nobel Laureate, Karl von Frisch, elucidated the ways honeybees communicate information to each other about the source of honey and distance to reach there. Scientists have always been fascinated about this evidently programmed complicated mode of communication.
In recent years, Thomas D Seeley, Professor at Cornell University, revealed that bees have something to teach us about the power of democratic decision-making. Based on his decades of research, he shows that the inner operation of a honeybee colony is not governed by a queen; instead the work of a colony is governed collectively by the workers themselves.
In his book ‘Honeybee Democracy’, Professor Seeley vividly explains how a colony achieves near-perfect accuracy when it selects its home, and how tens of thousands of worker bees, through enlightened self-interest, cooperate to serve a colony’s common goal. He suggested following five lessons that we could learn from bees about making better group decisions. They are: Compose a decision-making group of individuals with shared interests; minimise the role of the leader; seek diverse solutions; debate, debate, debate; and use quorum for an accurate and speedy decision.
While selecting a home to build a nest, honeybees form a group of ‘scout’ bees consisting of old and experienced worker bees. Based on information provided by the scout bees on different locations, the worker bees collectively decide which site to choose. The 2nd Constituent Assembly should have been an opportunity for the members to form a small team to come up with the draft constitution, to be shared, discussed and endorsed by all. Honeybees make decisions without a leader. The queen sits on the sidelines, and the group makes decisions without a leader telling them what to do.
However, in our political system the leaders are expected to take all the decisions, and are criticised if they fail to do so. Generally speaking, the leaders function as the boss, conducting meetings in a directive way and expressing displeasure if there are disagreements or if the discussion is not going in the set direction. Though they have created some kind of mechanism for taking collective decisions with broader participation and summed knowledge, in practice, however, decisions are made as per the wishes of leaders and organisational heads.
On the other hand, honeybees look for diverse options before taking any decision. For instance, before a honeybee colony decides to swarm and find a new home for building a nest, the bees will explore miles of territory and up to 20 possible places to live. Debate is a part and parcel of the decision-making process in a honeybee colony. Before a decision is made on the best site, there is often disagreement among the honeybees about which nest is the best candidate – the roomiest, sunniest and highest off the ground. People, too, should engage in a spirited and civil exchange of views. In short, there should be open and public competition of ideas, but, like the bees, each person should make a private and personal evaluation of the ideas.
Using a quorum for accurate and speedy decisions is also an important lesson we can learn from the honeybees. Unanimity is not always the answer when it comes to effective group decisions. The bees, therefore, use quorum sensing to make a speedy, yet accurate decision. Humans, too, can employ this tactic by periodically polling a group to see how close it is to agreement. If far from unanimity, then more debate is needed, but if only a small minority remains in support of a position, then further debate may be pointless, and it is better to switch to the majority and achieve consensus. In the name of unanimity, we should not be wasting a lot of time.
Another important lesson we could learn from the honeybees is that the leader should refrain from advocating any solutions he or she would like to see adopted and instead should exhibit an open- minded desire for fresh ideas. The leaders should acknowledge the fact that there could be diverse solutions for a single problem, and the more they use group intelligence, the better decision options they can provide.

297,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-give-sports-its-due/,"Sports has never been a priority in Nepal, and this, perhaps, explains why the infrastructure existing in this field is so poor
Like religion, sports has the potential to bring people together for a common cause. It is a great generator of nationalism, promoting unity even in countries where ethnic strife has destroyed the harmony and bonhomie among the people, and a perennial cycle of conflict and instability is the order of the day. Unfortunately, many a Third World country thinks that sports is a luxury that it can ill afford, and Nepal is no exception. Sports has never been a priority in this country, and it, perhaps, explains the poor infrastructure existing in this field and the inability to harvest medals in international meets. Nepal plays host to the 13th South Asian Games (SAG), which formally opens on Sunday. Yet, the venue of the opening ceremony and many of the sports events, the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu, just so managed to be ready for the Games, depriving our athletes and other sportsmen from practising there even when the SAG is taking place on their home ground. And indifference on the part of the National Sports Council (NSC) to the pleas and demands of sportspersons for training and quality gear could take another toll on the medal tally this time.
Of the many sports events that will be played during the SAG, Nepal holds good promise in individual martial arts games, such as taekwondo, wushu, judo and the like. Yet it has come to light that sanshou players are training with makeshift equipment even though the Nepal Wushu Federation had submitted a list of equipment needed for its players four months ago to the NSC. How do you expect good results when sanshou players are training on hard karate mats with boxing gloves and taekwondo pads and guards? A wushu mat is softer than a karate mat as the players must jump high and balance themselves, and not get injured when they land on it. So when the players appear in the real arena, it could have telling effect on their performance.
The sorry state of sports in Nepal requires a major haul as it is marred by corruption and mismanagement. Like any other sector in Nepal, sports is also highly politicised, where the different sports bodies are no more than extended forms of the youth wings of the political parties. It is not a paucity of funds that is keeping our sports sector weak, it is gross misuse of the available resources. A country need not be big and rich to promote sports. Small and poor countries like North Korea, Cuba and Mongolia have harvested gold medals in the Olympics without fail throughout the decades or have qualified for the World Cup, which makes one wonder what is wrong with South Asian countries that are home to 1.5 billion people. Unless there are officials in the sports bodies who are committed to the promotion of sports, little is going to change. It is also high time the private sector chipped in to promote and polish sports in the country. Nepal today has big companies that could provide funds as part of their corporate social responsibility to enhance the sector, as it can no longer rely on government largesse alone.

Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) is all set to launch the profiles of 476 peaks under the guidance of the Department of Tourism (DoT) targeting the Visit Nepal Year 2020. The DoT had assigned the NMA to prepare the profiles with detailed information of the peaks, including the route, itinerary, picture and height of each of the peaks, district, area, social condition of the area and budget details for climbing the peaks three years ago. Most of them are virgin, and they can be climbed in the spring season. Once the profiles of the peaks are launched, the government will have their scientific database.
Although the project had started some five years ago, the NMA could finalise it only this year after the government released the required budget of Rs 5 million for the project in two installments. Of the 476 peaks above 5,800 metres suitable for climbing, the government has so far opened 414 mountains for climbing. It is good that the NMA has been able to prepare the profiles of most of the snow-clad mountains. But opening more peaks for climbing is not enough. We also need to add basic facilities, such as hotels, lodges, reliable communications and a sound rescue operation system in times of emergency there.

298,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/language-barriers/,"It was report card day at school. I, as the principal, was standing at a corner and observing the interaction between the teachers and guardians. The lady teacher was explaining the results of a child to his parent, mostly in English. The old man kept nodding his head as if he fully understood her.
On seeing me, the man approached me with the grade sheet that was in English and asked me to elaborate. I explained it to him in Nepali. The old man nodded, and his face showed that he understood better than the lady teacher. He said he never had the opportunity to learn English. He told me he could do everything in Nepali, but faced difficulties these days due to the over use of the English language everywhere.
“Thank you for explaining the academic progress of my kid. By the way, would it be possible to publish these grade sheets in Nepali so that I can read and analyse them myself?” he queried.
That day changed my way of thinking. There are countries like Japan, Germany, Korea, Russia, where the national language is used in everyday life. Even without learning the English language, these people have made great progress. But why in Nepal is everybody after the English language?
A language has many characteristics. Some of the real meanings of a language cannot be translated into another language without destroying the original essence. Why are we creating such English language-related ambiguities for the common people?
Most of the signboards are in English in major cities. Why not in Nepali or both the languages? Thousands of people go
to the Arab world to work carrying their passport, but they cannot read it. Why not a passport in both the languages? I have seen foreign passports in both languages.
Do we want to destroy our national language? Even a road’s name is in English only.  Doesn’t a Nepali need a direction in Kathmandu? Even government notices are at times in English only!
It’s too late to start correcting the issue. But then, emphasis should be on both the languages – English and Nepali. Otherwise our children will never learn the special things or meanings of our national language. So, the government needs to take immediate action to make the correction.  Schools should be ready to publish the grade sheets in Nepali. Banks should provide statements in Nepali. Business houses must print their receipts in Nepali.

299,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/dont-ban-ride-hailing-it-is-part-of-the-gig-economy/,"Without the ride hailers’ effort, the platform will not generate a single penny. The sweat, time and effort of the rider are the base of the business of the platform economy. This the government must understand
The IT-enabled ride-hailing services have been in discussion and in question for the past few months. The Department of Transport Management says it’s illegal as per the prevailing law of the land. But, is the ban a solution? Shouldn’t the government open a dialogue to be heard by all the stakeholders? Shouldn’t the government understand the aspiration of innovative forces? We must understand that ride-hailing has emerged in Nepal not solely because of the irregularities seen in the conventional taxis, such as overcharges or refusal to give a ride, but is the process of globalization, which is inevitable.

Ride-hailing is not a patent idea of Nepali developers. It originated somewhere else and is already widely practised. In terms of economy, the ride-sharing market is booming, and despite the recent roadblocks, shows no signs of slowing down. JWT Intelligence claims that the global ride-sharing market could be worth more than $170 billion by 2025, from $43 billion in 2017. This growth is making room for new players in ride-hailing around the world, challenging market leaders and expanding the original ride-hailing model into a nimble, omni-channel suite of services.
Tootle or Pathao in Nepal might be a novel digital platform for mobility, but outside the country these IT-enabled services are not new. It is just a technological innovation that fulfills the need gap between the service provider and the customer. To borrow the definition by author Nick Skillicorn, the innovation is “turning an idea into a solution that adds value from a customer’s perspective”. I am pretty sure we definitely will witness many more innovations in the near future.
The purpose of my write-up is to ensure social security for the gig economy, or the platform economy workers, in terms of ride-hailing, which is representing non-standard employment.
Nepal has introduced social security through contributions based on the Social Security Act-2017, which is now in action. Private enterprises have been made to register as employers, and under them, the workers are registered with a social security number. It is a new scheme, and the first of its kind in South Asia as well, which covers the private sector employees in Nepal. The Social Security Fund (SSF) claims that about 30,000 employers are registered in the Social Security Fund as employers while about 110,000 workers are registered.
In the eye of Labour Law-2017 of Nepal, there are no informal workers because the workers are categorised into five employment forms, such as Regular Employment, Work-Based Employment, Time-bound Employment, Casual Employment and Part-time Employment. The law doesn’t recognise another form of employment in this respect. Now the question is, how do we define the ride-hailers? Aren’t they workers? Should we define them as self-employed? In this case, most of the international practices have different approaches to defining and understanding it according to their own context and legal systems. But the main feature is that without the ride hailers’ effort, the platform will not generate a single penny. Therefore, the sweat, time and effort of the rider are the base of the business of the platform economy. The government must understand this hidden fact in the gig economy. The gig economy, which is also called platform economy, refers to the availability of crowd workers. This will equally apply to other IT-enabled services, including e-commerce, online shopping, web/app based goods and service providers.
Hence, the platform economy owner (the platform provider) must be made to register them as employers with the Social Security Fund, then only should they be able to operate their business activities, whether IT-enabled or non-IT-enabled. Once the service providers (the platform owners) are registered as employers with the fund, the riders will automatically be registered in the system. According to an estimate, there could be more than 50,000 registered riders in the ride-hailing platform in Nepal, especially under Pathao and Tootle. This must be recognised as a new form of employment under the gig economy. Anything that is linked to economic activities and is operating in the country without any legal system is obviously dangerous and arouses suspicion. So we need a system to regulate the ride-sharing services in the gig economy.
With the ride-sharing industry to grow at a rate of more than 20% during 2019-2025 worldwide, I am optimistic that sooner or later the current issue of the legality of private-vehicle use in the ride-sharing platform, that is, Tootle and Pathao in Nepal, will be resolved, and they will be recognised with some prerequisites and conditions to fulfill. As stated above, there is no doubt that the platform economy is creating jobs for the new generation in Nepal, which is also a focus and prime concern of the government. Out of the many concerns in this scenario, the government’s prime concern must be to include the ride-hailers under the contributory social security of Nepal, which provides monetary assistance to the contributor (worker) with inadequate or no income during the course of employment or at the stage of no employment. The government should be a referee and allow fair play in this new form of future work.

300,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-worrying-scenario/,"Most of the projects are delayed for years due to political patronage given to contractors and poor monitoring system in the bureaucracy
After reshuffling his cabinet for the first time in nearly two years on November 19, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli instructed his cabinet members to take legal action against those contractors, project officials and consultants not completing the development projects within the deadline set at the time of awarding the contracts. He also expressed deep concern over low capital spending – around 6.92 per cent in the first quarter of the fiscal – which has brought the national economy to a standstill. Failure to spend the capital expenditure will mean failure to create job opportunities within the country, which will ultimately force the youths to migrate abroad for employment. The most worrying scenario is that even the national pride projects have been delayed or stalled or extended for years – some of which have been extended as many as nine times without any reasons. Such delay in completing the projects has put the state’s money injected into them at risk. The contractors have been found bagging as many projects as possible taking legal advantage of the loopholes in the Public Procurement Act (PPA) that states the lowest bidder should be awarded the government projects, regardless of whether the contractor has the institutional capacity to carry out the work on time or not.
Against this backdrop, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has initiated detailed probe into the 100 worst performing projects, their contractors and consultants with a view to helping the government ensure that the long-stalled projects are completed without any delay. The anti-graft constitutional body has found that most of the worst performing projects are related to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation, Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, Ministry of Health and Population and Ministry of Urban Development, among others. The CIAA found that more than Rs 24 billion has been disbursed to the contractors as mobilization fund for 1,800 projects whose progress is dismal. This amount of money has been stuck in the pockets of the contractors, some of whom have not even started their works. The CIAA had earlier carried out detailed studies of 1,700 projects, with recommendations to the government to take legal action against the erring contractors. But the government took no action.
The main reasons behind the unfinished projects can be attributed to the flawed provision in the PPA that requires a project to be awarded to the lowest bidder. This law must change if a project is to be completed on time with quality assurance. Other factors contributing to the delay of a project is the political patronage to the contractors, who quite often defy the legal provision; poor monitoring mechanism from the top layer of the bureaucracy; lack of a centralised system of keeping track record of the contractors’ past performance; and lack of coordination between and among the concerned ministries in removing the legal and other practical hurdles in the field. The government will not be able to spend the Rs 408 billion capital budget in a time-bound manner unless it makes drastic reforms in these areas.

Know your onions
There has been no let up in the price of onions this seasons, with the vegetable fetching a record high of Rs 230 a kilo in the domestic market on Tuesday, a 318 per cent surge in three months. Its price started going up in October after India put a ban on its export due to shortages in the country itself. Nepal imports onions worth billions annually from India. Nepal is not the only country in south Asia reeling under high onion prices, consumers in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are also going through the same ordeal.
There are two solutions to the shortage of onions in Nepal. One is to stop eating them as the vegetable is not something you cannot do without in the Nepali kitchen. This will also save a lot of foreign exchange that is flowing out on its import. Secondly, see the acute shortage as an opportunity to grow onions in the country itself. With onions fetching as much as Rs 200 in the wholesale market itself, even a small patch of land will bring handsome returns to the farmer. The government should divert its attention to bringing uncultivated land across the country to grow food, such as onions, to cut imports and also retain the youths here.

301,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/of-human-folly/,"I  see this world differently and have a different perception about it. I observed this world very closely with all the oppression taking place under the sky. I saw the tears of the oppressed who had no one to comfort them. Power lay with their oppressors, and they realised that the dead were happier than those living. But luckier than both of them is the one who
has not been born yet, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.
I found many fools boasting of the verity of Earth’s greatness. But the day of death is better than the day of birth. I thought in my heart, what can possibly be there on earth to appreciate? In the place of judgement, I found wickedness; in the place of honesty, treachery; and in the place of righteousness, transgression.
To my surprise, I have seen another evil under the sky, and it weighs heavily on man. God gives man property, possessions, power, prosperity, personality, position and honour, so that he lacks nothing that his heart desires. But God doesn’t enable him to enjoy them, and a stranger enjoys them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil.
A man may have many children and live many years. Yet no matter how he lives, if he can’t enjoy his prosperity and doesn’t receive a decent funeral, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.
It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded. Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than man.
All efforts of man are for feeding the mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied. What advantage has a wise man over a fool? What does a poor man gain by knowing how to conduct himself before others?
For who knows what is good for a person in life, during the few and meaningless days he passes through like a shadow? I with assurance will say that all share a common destiny – the righteous and wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean. As it is with the good man so it is with the sinner, as it is with those who take the oath so it is with those who are afraid of it.
Finally, I haven’t found any difference between the fate of animals and human beings. For what happens to humans also happens to animals: as one dies so does the other. All go to one place. So I learnt that there is nothing better for man than to enjoy his work. For no one can help him see what will happen after him.

302,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/land-use-act-can-local-governments-make-use-of-it/,"The underlying concern now is how well the local levels will tread through this virgin territory for the realisation of the Act. Overwhelmed by day-to-day operations, they suffer from inadequate financial, human and infrastructural resources
After several months under consideration and a few debates in the Parliament, the nation’s first ever Land Use Act has come into effect. The term ‘land use’ at first glance may seem like a stand-alone denotation, dealing with use of land. Land use, however, encompasses a much wider interpretation and application. It is an interdisciplinary field, subsuming social, economic, legal, administrative, political, environmental, technological and physical spheres of planning and governance.
The Land Use Act, 2019 has assigned rights, responsibilities and duties to the federal, provincial and local governments. In theory and as practised globally, being the front line representative of the government, local governments assume micro level roles in the execution of all land use activities, while the federal and provincial governments only assume macro level regulatory roles, with some exceptions.

As such, the Act and provisions under it for the local governments should be seen with special care. It is also worth exploring if the local governments are equipped with what it takes to successfully implement the Act.
Some of the key provisions under the Act for local governments include: formation of municipal land use bodies, acquisition of land use maps from the federal government, development of land use plans, and carrying out zoning process, land use change, land title update, land valuation and taxation.The local land use council and local land use implementation committee are the two bodies mandated by the Act.
The municipal council is bestowed an additional role as the land use council. In order to support the land use council, a land use implementation committee will also be in place.
The two bodies will have to execute all land use planning works, like plan and policy formulation, enforcement, monitoring, penalising planning offences, conservation of significant areas and other general activities.
Acquisition of land use maps from the federal government involves receiving all kinds of land use maps, raw data and reports produced by the ongoing National Land Use Project. Local governments will then have to amend such maps, making it more appropriate to the local context. Using such maps and local data, municipal land use plan, ward level land use plans and, if necessary, separate rural and urban land use plans are also to be developed.
Similarly, the zoning process involves making changes to land zones assigned by the federal government if required, and creating a local zoning ordinance. Land use change is also permissible if a local government deems any land unsuitable for settlement or human activity. Updating land titles as per the land zones, valuation of land, and administration of land taxes also come as local responsibility.
The underlying concern now is how well the local governments will tread through this virgin territory for the realisation of the Act. Overwhelmed by day-to-day operations, formulation of laws, fiscal planning and development activities, local governments suffer from inadequate financial, human and infrastructural resources. A specialised field as such calls for specialist manpower and departments.
The Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration had even published elaborate municipal organograms and staffing requirements last year. However, most local governments are yet to set up a fully manned and functional town planning, infrastructure development and environmental management wing.
Operation so far is being handled by a handful of engineers and surveyors, often preoccupied with building approvals, monitoring and local development projects.
A state of reliance on other governmental actors looms over local governments. The Land Use Act, 2019, and Local Government Operation Act, 2017 are precise in emphasising federal and provincial control over local governments in land use planning activities. Due to this, local governments now await provincial land use laws, and whether they can move ahead without such provincial laws remains largely unclear.
Likewise, activities such as development of land use plans, zoning, land title update, land valuation and taxation require use of land and revenue data traditionally collected, managed and owned by the Land Revenue (malpot) and Survey (napi) offices.
Although the Local Government Operation Act has passed down majority of the malpot and napi functions to the local governments, implying a merger between these two (or at least all of their functions) and local governments, resistance from the former is high. This puts acquisition and use of malpot, napi data by local governments for land use planning at stake.
The Land Use Act is a gateway to amalgamate sectoral interests and better land use practices. Most of the functions provisioned to the local governments are specialised in nature, requiring collaborative partnerships, sound legal base, and linkage between traditional methods and modern technologies, all backed by strong political and bureaucratic will.
How, and to what extent local governments and planners make use of the Act will now determine the course of correction of the historically flawed land use planning system.

303,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-deplorable-conduct/,"The unruly conduct of the student unions has its genesis in the upbringing by the parties that use them for disruptive activities
The assault on the principal of Tri Chandra College on Monday by members of the student wing affiliated to the ruling Nepal Communist Party must be censured by all as it manifests the state of anarchy prevalent in government educational institutions. The principal, Pradeep Bahadur Neupane, was beaten up so badly that he suffered injury on his right shoulder and had to be rushed to the National Trauma Centre for treatment. Neupane was attacked in his office Monday morning for having raised the Bachelor level fees in the science and humanities streams without first taking the consent of the student wing, the All Nepal National Free Students’ Union (ANNFSU) – a ground that defies any rationale or justification. The college has raised the fee for Bachelor of Science to Rs 14,020 a year from Rs 6,815. The annual fee for Bachelor of Arts is Rs 12,050, up from Rs 6,590. The student union had been warning the college administration not to hike the fees without first consulting them. But the college management committee had gone ahead with it on Friday.
Apparently, the college couldn’t have raised the fees arbitrarily. Tribhuvan University has given the affiliate college a mandate to revise the fees every year, but it had not been able to do so for ten years due to intimidation by the student unions. The college administration had no option other than to raise the fees as the subsidy provided by the university couldn’t even meet the daily expenses, let alone enhance the physical infrastructure, library and laboratory equipment. An education in a government facility costs only a fraction of what it does in a private institute, and without the subsidy provided by the government, public colleges would collapse overnight. It is a fact that national colleges are constantly short of money, and the only way to raise the needed funds is by raising fees, if only they were allowed to by the unions. Fees in public college are usually rational, and hiking it should be the prerogative of the college, without having to be dictated by the unions. The unions have no business interfering in the working of the college administration.
The unruly conduct of the student unions has its genesis in the upbringing by the political parties that use them for disruptive activities such as strikes, demonstrations, protests and bandhs. The student unions would not have dared to act so wilfully if they did not have the protection of the political parties. The road to power begins with student politics in government colleges, and this has helped nearly all politicians reach the highest executive posts, including that of the prime minister. This perhaps explains why quality education is of no concern to both the student leaders and those who make it to the corridors of power. It is indeed a pity that college students, who are the future of this country, should be behaving like mindless vandals. It is time all the parties distanced themselves from their student unions or even agreed to dissolve them altogether. The assault on Neupane cannot be treated lightly, and it remains to be seen how the ruling Nepal Communist Party will deal with it.

A cruel act
An elderly couple was ostracised on charges of practising witchcraft in Bigu village of Bigu Municipality, Dolakha. The elderly couple were ostracised from their village by a Tole Reform Committee, chaired by committee chairman Ratna Narayan Shrestha. The hapless couple were meted out torture from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm on November 17. Nine other persons were also involved in torturing the couple. They were forced to sign a document calling them ‘witches’ and were also banned from attending weddings and other feasts in the village. However, all of the culprits were arrested after an FIR was filed against them by their son at the District Police Office.
It is against the law to allege someone of being a witch, a superstitious belief still prevalent in the society. It is especially shameful to see the Tole Reform Committee, which is supposed to bring reforms in society, formally taking action against an elderly couple on an unfounded allegation. The culprits who indulged in the cruel act deserve maximum punishment as allowed by the law. We get to hear of such ill treatment meted out to people in many parts of the country even though all know that a witch hunt is nothing but a superstitious belief.

304,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/feminism-advocacy-of-womens-rights/,"There is a famous saying by G.D Anderson: Feminism isn’t about making a woman strong. Women are already strong. It’s about changing the way the world perceives that strength. So, if there is no feminism, the world would be cruel to all the women. There would be no women’s rights, no justice and nothing at all.
Being a girl child, I’ve had the opportunity to witness change that has been made in gender discrimination over the years. But still gender inequality is very much there.
Born and raised in a poor country, I see widespread gender-based violence. It knows no social, economic or national boundaries. Worldwide, an estimated one in three women will experience physical or sexual abuse in her lifetime, which gets even higher in south Asian countries like Nepal.
There are many women activists who are trying to bridge the gap between a boy and girl child in terms of gender discrimination. Feminism has been playing a vital role in addressing the issue. Still many women live in miserable conditions. So at times I ponder, where are all the women’s rights activists?
Certainly, rational feminists exist, and are doing good work. But that is not the face of the movement today.
Right now, we have feminists talking about the gender pay gap, or how we should have a female president, or how companies should require a certain number of women on their executive boards, as if these are the gender issues of our time. Shouldn’t they be worrying about the rights of female victims?
There’s poor implementation of rules and regulations against gender-based violence. Women will whine about feminism and talk about equality, but there hasn’t been any change in people’s attitude. She’s still judged by the dress she wears. Who do you think should be blamed for early pregnancy – the negligent parents, the government, the feminist legislators, the permissive society? Or perhaps, all of them?
I still notice how strict our parents are towards the girl child, how the society shuns an early boy-girl relationship and how women are made to be refined and reserved.
Every day, we get to hear of violence against women and girls – rape, murder, harassment, acid attacks or simply burnt alive over dowry. Feminism is supposed to be about equal rights, helping both men and women to overcome the gender stigma.

Tune in to some other channel you find a bevy of girls attired in the bare minimal, exhibiting their otherwise must coverable limbs. “Viewing conspiracies, family feuds and backbiting lends my BP a sudden upward swing.” I halted, caught my breath and went on with my diatribe against the fool’s box.
My mother heaved a sigh of relief as I disconnected the phone. “Yours is a mobile phone, why don’t you walk and talk in the lobby or elsewhere?”

306,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/holidays-bring-phishing-scam-surge-aimed-at-small-business/,"NEW YORK: The email looked legitimate, so Danielle Radin clicked on the link it contained, expecting to have her products included in a holiday gift guide.
“I instantly regretted it,” says Radin, owner of Mantra Magnets, a website that sells wellness products. “It took me to some random website that looked like those pop-ups telling you that you’ve won the lottery.”
Within days of that click three weeks ago, Radin began getting notifications that people in Ecuador, China and elsewhere were trying to access her email account. She wasn’t surprised; she knew her San Diego-based small business had been the target of a phishing scam.
While cybercriminals strike at any time of the year, they’re particularly active during the holiday and income tax filing seasons when computer users expect to see more emails — and scammers are increasingly targeting individual small businesses with phishing scams, sending messages that look legitimate but do harm instead. An unsuspecting owner or employee clicks on a link or attachment and like Radin finds that malicious software has invaded their PCs.
Cybersecurity experts find that criminals who used to blanket thousands of computer users in hopes of fooling a handful have refined their methods. Scammers find small businesses through websites, social media sites and by combing email address books. They also mine personal data from breaches at retailers and other large companies. Then, using a process called social engineering, they construct emails that increasingly look realistic, as if they truly come from a boss, colleague, friend, potential client or vendor, a bank and even the IRS.
“In the last year or two they’ve been running more professional campaigns,” says Perry Toone, owner of Thexyz, an email service provider based in Toronto. “It can take a couple of minutes for me to determine that they’re phishing scams. That tells me they’re doing a very good job.”
Radin believes the scammers found her through her website or a blog. Like many small businesses, she has an email address on her site, and the scammers figured out that she might be interested in selling via a holiday gift guide. But finding a target is one thing; the scam won’t work unless it tricks an email recipient into clicking. Even those who are tech savvy can sometimes let their guard down. Radin was duped even though she’s the author of “Everyone’s Been Hacked,” a book sold online.
Often a scam succeeds because there’s just a shred of doubt in a computer user — the email is realistic enough that an owner or employee feels they need to read it. Sometimes a staffer clicks out of fear or a sense of responsibility, says Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College.
“It might not sound very personal, but you have an idea that you should go ahead — you feel like the email is coming from the boss,” he says.
Computer users may not be looking as closely as they should at an email — there can be subtle signs that a message is trouble. Terry Cole, owner of Cole Informatics, a company whose work includes cybersecurity, recalls getting an email that truly seemed to be from a colleague. He was one of several people in the industry to receive it.
“It said that this colleague had sent me a secure private message that was ready for me to read and included a link to click. This was absolutely consistent with my normal experiences communicating with him,” says Cole, whose company is located in Parsons, Tennessee.
Cole didn’t do in that instance what he usually does and advises everyone to do: check the email address to be sure it’s completely correct. When he clicked on the link, it took him to a bogus website claiming to be connected with Microsoft and asking him for his ID and password. He went no further and suffered no damage to his PC.
The holidays provide scammers with extra opportunities: emailed greeting cards, package shipment notices, offers of discounts — all of them false. Cybercriminals also seek personal information from owners and employees under the guise of needing them to create a W-2 or 1099 tax form; at this time of year, business owners’ thoughts are turning to taxes.
“Something that claims to know you, your name, where you work and wants you to take some action is harder to spot,” says Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company based in Sunnyvale, California.
A common scam at holiday time is an email purportedly from the boss telling a staffer to go buy gift cards and email the numbers back, DeGrippo says.
“When it appears to come from a boss or CEO, I think there is that tendency among employees to follow those directions. They’re playing on their emotions,” she says.
Often, a scam succeeds in getting an employee to click on a personal email while on a company PC — many workers check their personal email while at work. Even though the email came through on a personal message, it’s the company’s machine that can be infected.
Companies can protect themselves in part by restricting employees’ access to personal email sites, Telang says. He also suggests seminars to help staffers understand the risks that even legitimate-looking emails can present.
Some of the scams aim at monitoring a user’s keystrokes. So anyone accessing a company or personal account of any sort can be giving a criminal access to their money or sensitive personal data. One tool to prevent a bank account from being emptied or a credit card maxed out is to have accounts with multifactor authentication; that requires a password and a separate code sent to a different device and that is different for each login.

307,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-co-founders-step-aside-as-pichai-takes-helm-of-parent-alphabet/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google co–founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping aside as leaders of the Internet behemoth they founded 21 years ago, ending an extraordinary run that saw them build one of the world’s most valuable and influential companies.
Trusted lieutenant Sundar Pichai, who has run the core Google search business since 2015, will immediately take the reins as CEO of parent Alphabet Inc.
“While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it’s time to assume the role of proud parents — offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!” Page and Brin wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.
Page, Brin and Pichai have shared an emphasis on developing artificial intelligence software to make web searching faster and more personalised, while expanding the range of information and services available from a simple text query.
But their vision faces unprecedented scrutiny, with governments on five continents demanding better safeguards, an end to what many view as anticompetitive conduct, and more taxes from the world’s largest online advertising company. Thousands of employees have protested, and some have even resigned, over ongoing concern that Google‘s famous “don’t be evil” mantra – once embraced by Page and Brin – may be cracking.
Streamlining Alphabet‘s unorthodox management structure could help the company better respond to the challenges and focus on growing profits, investors said.
“This signals a shift away from the more fringy efforts … and more towards a company focused on technology that makes money,” said Kim Caughey Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
Alphabet, which owns more than a dozen companies including self-driving car business Waymo and health care software company Verily, was created in 2015 as part of a restructuring. The Google unit retained control of major businesses including video giant YouTube, the Android smartphone software and hardware operations, and cloud computing.
Page had wanted to focus on developing the newer businesses, which collectively lose money. He left Google, by far the biggest and most profitable part of Alphabet, to Pichai, who in turn delegates a lot of authority to deputies who manage the various product lines. Brin had stayed on as Alphabet‘s president, spending time on robotics, health ventures and other research projects.
But Page and Brin, once regular sights at public events and at Google headquarters, had become much less visible in recent years. Page’s retreat into the background drew increasing criticism from employees and US lawmakers, who demanded answers from him rather than Pichai about controversial projects such as an experimental search app for Chinese users.
Page and Brin, both 46, remain directors of the parent company but will cede their respective CEO and president titles immediately, Alphabet said. The president role will not be filled, it said, describing the changes as long discussed.
Page’s voice has been impaired for years because of a chronic condition, but his health did not play a role in the decision to step aside, Alphabet said.
“With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it’s the natural time to simplify our management structure,” the co–founders said. “We are deeply committed to Google and Alphabet for the long term.”
The co–founders still control the company through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26.1% of Alphabet‘s total voting power, Brin 25.25% and Pichai less than 1%. Alphabet shares rose 0.56% following the after-hours announcement to $1,302.
‘MOONSHOTS’ AND REGULATORS
Page and Brin developed the core Google search technology while they were still graduate students at Stanford, and it quickly proved far superior to competing search engines of the early Internet era.
By the time it went public in 2004, Google dominated Web search and was on its way to becoming a household name and the most powerful force in the global advertising business. The young co–founders also nurtured a free-wheeling, engineering-driven culture that became a model in Silicon Valley, which is littered with startups launched by Google veterans.
Pichai, 47, who has spent 15 years at Google, rose to prominence while leading the development of Google‘s Chrome browser. He later led product development and engineering across all of Google‘s services for a year before gaining the CEO title.
Page and Brin are active in a range of non-Google ventures. Page funded a company attempting to develop flying cars, and Brin at a conference last year discussed a budding interest in cryptocurrency. The Alphabet structure was designed in part to let them pursue new “moonshot” projects.
Investors and regulators, however, were never completely sold.
Alphabet had used the separation between Page’s and Pichai‘s roles to defend its limited financial disclosures about YouTube and other large Google businesses when the practice was questioned by US securities regulators in 2017.
It contended that publicly reported financial results were in line with what Page reviewed as Alphabet CEO. Regulators did not take further action, but the company’s stance has frustrated investors trying to evaluate its performance.
Alphabet declined to comment on whether public financial reporting would change with Pichai assuming both CEO positions.

308,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/for-babies-born-with-hiv-start-treatment-right-away-study/,"WASHINGTON: When babies are born with HIV, starting treatment within hours to days is better than waiting even the few weeks to months that’s the norm in many countries, researchers reported Wednesday.
The findings, from a small but unique study in Botswana, could influence care in Africa and other regions hit hard by the virus. They also might offer a clue in scientists’ quest for a cure.
The Harvard-led team found super early treatment limits how HIV takes root in a newborn’s body, shrinking the “reservoir” of virus that hides out, ready to rebound if those youngsters ever stop their medications.
“We don’t think the current intervention is itself curative, but it sets the stage” for future attempts, said Dr Daniel Kuritzkes of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who co-authored the study.
Giving pregnant women a cocktail of anti-HIV drugs can prevent them from spreading the virus to their unborn children, a step that has dramatically reduced the number of babies born with the virus worldwide. Still, some 300 to 500 infants are estimated to be infected every day in sub-Saharan Africa.
Doctors have long known that treating babies in the first weeks to months of life is important, because their developing immune systems are especially vulnerable to HIV. But an infant dubbed the “Mississippi baby” raised a critical question: Should treatment start even earlier? The girl received a three-drug combination within 30 hours of her birth in July 2010, highly unusual for the time. Her family quit treatment when she was a toddler — yet her HIV remained in remission for a remarkable 27 months before she relapsed and restarted therapy.
The Botswana study was one of several funded by the US National Institutes of Health after doctors learned of the Mississippi baby, to further explore very early treatment.
The findings are encouraging, said Dr Deborah Persaud, a pediatric HIV specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the Botswana study but helped evaluate the Mississippi baby.
“The study showed what we hypothesized happened in the Mississippi baby, that very early treatment really prevents establishment of these long-lived reservoir cells that currently are the barrier to HIV eradication,” Persaud said.
She cautioned: “Very early treatment is important, but prevention should still be our top priority.”
In Botswana, researchers tested at-risk newborns, enrolling 40 born with HIV, treating them within hours to a few days, and tracking them for two years. On Wednesday, they reported results from the first 10 patients, comparing them with 10 infants getting regular care — treatment beginning when they were a few months old.
Medication brought HIV under control in both groups. But the children treated earliest had a much smaller reservoir of HIV in their blood, starting about six months into treatment, the researchers reported in Science Translational Medicine.
The earliest-treated children also got another benefit: more normal functioning of some key parts of the immune system.
One big question: Did the HIV reservoir shrink enough to make a long-term difference? To find out, next year the researchers will give these children experimental antibodies designed to help keep HIV in check, and test how they fare with a temporary stop to their anti-HIV drugs.
In the US, Europe and South Africa, it’s becoming common to test at-risk infants at birth. But in most lower-income countries, babies aren’t tested until they’re 4 to 6 weeks old, said study co-author Dr. Roger Shapiro, a Harvard infectious disease specialist.

309,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/web-inventor-has-an-ambitious-plan-to-take-back-the-net/,"World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee released an ambitious rule book for online governance — a bill of rights and obligations for the internet — designed to counteract the growing prevalence of such anti-democratic poisons as misinformation, mass surveillance and censorship.
The product of a year’s work by the World Wide Web Foundation where Berners-Lee is a founding director, the “ Contract for the Web ” seeks commitments from governments and industry to make and keep knowledge freely available — a digital policy agenda true to the design vision of the 30-year-old web.
The contract is non-binding, however. And funders and partners in the endeavour include Google and Facebook, whose data-collecting business models and sensation-rewarding algorithms have been blamed for exacerbating online toxicity.
“We haven’t had a fairly complex, fairly complete plan of action for the web going forward,” Berners-Lee said in an interview. “This is the first time we’ve had a rule book in which responsibility is being shared.”
For instance, the contract proposes a framework for protecting online privacy and personal data with clearly defined national laws that give individuals greater control over the data collected about them. Independent, well-resourced regulators would offer the public effective means for redress. Current laws and institutions don’t measure up to that standard.
Amnesty International just released a report charging that Google and Facebook’s business models are predicated on the abuse of human rights.
Berners-Lee nevertheless says that “having them in the room is really important.” He said both companies had approached the foundation seeking participation.
“We feel that companies and governments deserve equal seats at the table and understanding where they’re coming from is equally valuable,” he said. “To have this conversation around a table without the tech companies, it just wouldn’t have the clout and we wouldn’t have ended up with the insights.”
The nonprofit foundation’s top donors include the Swedish, Canadian and US governments and the Ford and Omidyar foundations.
One of its biggest challenges is the growing balkanization of the internet, with national governments led by China, Russia and Iran exerting increasing technical control over their domestic networks, tightening censorship and surveillance.
“The trend for balkanization is really worrying and it’s extreme at the moment in Iran,” said Berners-Lee. A strong government exhibits tolerance, the computer scientist added, for “other voices, opposition voices, foreign voices to be heard by its citizens.”
So how to prevent governments from restricting internet access at their borders?
One approach, said Berners-Lee, could be financial pressure. Multinational lenders could condition lower interest rates, for example, on a nation’s willingness to let information flow freely on its domestic network.

310,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-reins-in-political-advertising/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google is making it harder for political advertisers to target specific types of people.
The company said that as of January, advertisers will only be able to target US political ads based on broad categories such as gender, age and postal code. Currently, ads can be tailored for more specific groups — for instance, using information gleaned from public voter logs, such as political affiliation.
The change will take effect in the UK in the next week, before the general election, and in the European Union before the end of 2019. It will apply everywhere else in early January.
Google reiterated that ads making false claims are prohibited, adding that so-called deepfakes — realistic but false video clips — are not allowed. Neither are “demonstrably false” claims that could affect voter trust in an election.
But in a blog post announcing the news, Google Ads vice president Scott Spencer noted that political dialogue is important and “no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim and insinuation.”
“So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited — but we will continue to do so for clear violations,” he wrote.
Like all Google ads, political advertisers can also use the broader practice of “contextual targeting,” which involves placing ads about, say, climate change on articles about the environment.
The company is also requiring advertiser verification for a broader range of political messages. Previously, only ads mentioning candidates or officeholders for federal positions required verification. Now that will also include ads touching on state officials and candidates as well as ballot measures.
The move follows Twitter’s ban on political ads, which goes into effect on Friday.
Twitter also placed restrictions on ads related to social causes such as climate change or abortion.
In these instances, advertisers won’t be able to target those ads down to a user’s ZIP code or use political categories such as “conservative” or “liberal.” Rather, targeting must be kept broad, based on a user’s state or province, for instance.
Facebook has not made sweeping changes to any of its ads policies, but thrust the issue into public discussion this fall when it confirmed it would not remove false or misleading ads by politicians.
Critics have harshly condemned Facebook’s decision. Twitter also faced a backlash from those who found its ban too far-reaching.
Google has taken a more middling stance, but it’s unlikely to please everyone. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s campaign staff took issue with reports that Facebook might consider limiting its targeting practices.
“Facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020,” the campaign tweeted from its official account. “Tools that help us reach more great Americans & lift voices the media & big tech choose to ignore!”
Even Google’s limited targeting could receive backlash.
Critics and civil rights groups have said targeting specific zip codes or other small geographic zones can allow advertisers to discriminate or sway elections.
The expansion to Google’s verification process will take effect December 3.

311,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/amazon-says-its-considered-face-scanning-in-ring-doorbells/,"Amazon has considered adding facial recognition technology to its Ring doorbell cameras, according to a letter to a US senator defending its video-sharing partnerships with police.
The company told Senator Ed Markey that facial recognition is a “contemplated, but unreleased feature” of its home security cameras but that there are no plans to coordinate that feature with its law enforcement partnerships.
Markey wrote to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in September raising privacy and civil liberty concerns about Ring’s video-sharing agreements with police departments across the country. The company encourages police to tap into Ring’s Neighbors app, a forum for residents to share videos of suspicious activity captured by their home security cameras.

The Massachusetts Democrat also expressed alarm that Ring may be pursuing face-scanning technology after a patent application showed the company is exploring a system that could flag certain people as suspicious and automatically alert police.
Markey released Amazon’s responses Tuesday.
Amazon’s initial response to Markey said Ring doesn’t currently offer facial recognition. Then Markey sent another letter to Bezos asking why it’s mentioned in Ring’s privacy policy. In a Nov. 1 follow-up, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, Brian Huseman, said that the company frequently innovates based on customer demand and that facial recognition is an increasingly common feature in cameras made by competitors such as Google’s Nest division.
“If our customers want these features in Ring security cameras, we will only release these features with thoughtful design including privacy, security, and user control,” Huseman wrote.
Markey’s questions about facial recognition were part of broader concerns that some lawmakers and civil liberties advocates have about Ring and its police partnerships. Amazon sought to address those concerns in its letters to Markey, emphasizing that camera owners have a choice about whether to share videos. The company noted that police aren’t allowed to seek recordings that are longer than 12 hours in duration or that cover a geographical area that is too specific or broad.
But Amazon also said it doesn’t require law enforcement to delete a user’s video footage after a certain period. Nor would it entertain Markey’s request that it commit to never selling users’ biometric information, saying only that it doesn’t do so now.
Markey said Tuesday that Amazon is not doing enough to ensure that its products don’t run afoul of civil liberties.
“Connected doorbells are well on their way to becoming a mainstay of American households, and the lack of privacy and civil rights protections for innocent residents is nothing short of chilling,” he said in a statement.
“If you’re an adult walking your dog or a child playing on the sidewalk, you shouldn’t have to worry that Ring’s products are amassing footage of you and that law enforcement may hold that footage indefinitely or share that footage with any third parties,” he added.
More than 600 police departments have signed up to Ring’s network since last year and many say it is becoming a useful crime-fighting tool. Among them is the police chief of Markey’s hometown of Malden, Massachusetts. Chief Kevin Molis said he is Markey’s neighbor and has known him since the 1970s but disagrees with him about Ring.
“We consider it a valuable tool for public safety,” Molis said in an interview. “Is it a bad thing that private citizens, in order to make their streets safer, are investing their own money in a product that’s allowing crimes to be solved and crimes to be prevented?”
But staff attorney Mohammad Tajsar of the ACLU of Southern California said Amazon’s responses to Markey raise grave privacy concerns. Amazon told Markey it has no way of knowing if its cameras are collecting personal data from children or positioned in such a way that they’re intruding on a neighbor’s privacy.
“Even if you don’t sell data, or provide data to law enforcement, you’re creating a mechanism whereby people can express latent biases and racism and classism in a portal that encourages it,” Tajsar said.

312,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/china-tests-mars-lander-in-international-cooperation-push/,"HUAILAI: China invited international observers to a Thursday test of its Mars lander as it pushes for inclusion in more global space projects.
The demonstration of hovering, obstacle avoidance and deceleration capabilities was conducted at a site outside Beijing simulating conditions on the Red Planet, where the pull of gravity is about one-third that of Earth.
China plans to launch a lander and rover to Mars next year to explore parts of the planet in detail.
China’s burgeoning space program achieved a lunar milestone earlier this year by landing a probe on the mysterious far side of the moon.

It has developed rapidly, especially since it conducted its first crewed mission in 2003 and has sought cooperation with space agencies from Europe and elsewhere.
The US, however, has banned most space cooperation with China out of national security concerns, keeping China from participating in the International Space Station.
Despite that, China’s ambitions continue to grow as it seeks to rival the US, Russia and Europe in space and cement its position as a regional and global power.
Guests at Thursday’s event came from 19 countries and included the ambassadors of Brazil, France and Italy.
“This event is the first public appearance of China’s Mars exploration mission, also an important measure for China to pragmatically carry out space international exchanges and cooperation,” the China National Space Administration said in a news release.

313,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/should-people-be-paid-for-sharing-their-personal-data-online/,"
LONDON: From tagging photos on Facebook to driving with Google Maps, people should join forces in “data unions” to demand payment for letting online tools collect their data, according to an economist advocating for radical reforms to improve society.
Glen Weyl, a principal researcher at the research arm of US tech giant Microsoft, said people have been “fooled” into handing over data that is then used in artificial intelligence (AI) to copy human behaviour and possibly eliminate some jobs.
“Humans are doing all this work and then we are being told that we are doing nothing, that we play no role, and that these systems are just going to automate us away. This is profoundly dishonest,” Weyl told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“We need to respect the fact that those data are actually being created by the very people who these companies are claiming are no longer relevant. And we need to acknowledge that by compensating them.”
While getting paid for tagging photos on Instagram or uploading to YouTube might sound way off, the idea has been gaining some traction in the United States as tech giants from Google, to Facebook and Twitter, face increased scrutiny over the way they handle personal information.
Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang has said people should receive a share of the economic value generated from their data, while the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, recently proposed companies should pay a “data dividend”.
Weyl said the amount people would get is a matter of debate but it would, in general, depend on the size of the economy that becomes automated, with people getting more money the more jobs are taken over by artificial intelligence thanks to their data.
Estimates vary from $500 a year in a present-day scenario, to $20,000 some 15 years down the line, when some projections say a third of all jobs will be done by computers, he said.
Yet, single users are unlikely to get a penny unless they organise in “data unions” similarly to what workers did during the industrial revolution, said Weyl, a speaker at the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s annual Trust Conference on Thursday.
“People get paid for completing surveys, or putting television boxes in their home that monitor how they watch television,” he said.
“The problem is that the ability of people to receive reasonable and fair compensation for what they do online is undermined by the fact that all these other people are consenting to do it for free.”
Unions could bring together users with specific sets of data, like on travel or shopping habits, and bargain a better price for it, said Weyl, who co-authored the 2018 book “Radical Markets” with legal scholar Eric Posner.
They could also help address privacy concerns by restricting what information is collected and how it is used, he added.
Some early versions of data unions already exist.
US start-up Datacoup offers users a platform to monetise their data, while Dutch group ‘Datavakbond’, or “data labour union”, was set up in 2018 with the aim of negotiating directly with Facebook and Google over data use.
But Weyl said more people needed to get involved or become vocal about the need for a more equitable system otherwise things could slide in the opposite direction, with a few powerful companies and central states controlling most data.
“We can build alternatives to the worst scenarios but those alternatives are not going to come unless we do it together,” he said.

NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew past the snowman-shaped Arrokoth on New Year’s Day, 3 ½ years after exploring Pluto. At the time, this small icy world 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometres) beyond Pluto was nicknamed Ultima Thule given its vast distance from us.
“The name ‘Arrokoth’ reflects the inspiration of looking to the skies,” lead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said in a statement, “and wondering about the stars and worlds beyond our own.”
The name was picked because of the Powhatan’s ties to the Chesapeake Bay region.
New Horizons is operated from Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland. The Hubble Space Telescope — which discovered Arrokoth in 2014 — has its science operations in Baltimore.
The New Horizons team got consent for the name from Powhatan Tribal elders and representatives, according to NASA. The International Astronomical Union and its Minor Planet Center approved the choice.
Arrokoth is among countless objects in the so-called Kuiper Belt, or vast Twilight Zone beyond the orbit of Neptune. New Horizons will observe some of these objects from afar as it makes it’s way deeper into space.

Mercury is the solar system’s smallest, innermost planet. The next transit isn’t until 2032, and North America won’t get another shot until 2049.
In Maryland, clouds prevented NASA solar astrophysicist Alex Young from getting a clear peek. Live coverage was provided by observatories including NASA’s orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory.

317,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/one-big-step-google-buys-fitbit-for-2-1-billion/,"Google, the company that helped make it fun to just sit around surfing the web, is jumping into the fitness-tracker business with both feet, buying Fitbit for about $2.1 billion.
The deal could put Google in direct competition with Apple and Samsung in the highly competitive market for smartwatches and other wearable electronics. But it also raises questions about privacy and Google’s dominance in the tech industry.

The company’s announcement Friday came with a promise that it won’t sell ads using the intimate health data that Fitbit devices collect.
Fitbit is a pioneer in wearable fitness technology, making a range of devices that have become pop-culture accessories, from basic trackers that count how many steps you take each day to smartwatches that display messages and notifications from phones.
They can track activities such as running, cycling and swimming and record heart rates and sleep patterns. Fitbit typically asks for date of birth, gender, height and weight to help with such things as estimating calories burned. Some people use Fitbit’s app to record what they eat and how much water they drink. Women can track their periods.
Fitbit has 28 million active users worldwide and has sold more than 100 million devices.
Google, meanwhile, makes software for use in other manufacturers’ wearable devices, but those products haven’t gained much traction in the face of competition from Fitbit, Apple, Samsung and others. And Google doesn’t sell a device of its own.
The deal to buy Fitbit could give Google a needed boost.
“Google doesn’t want to be left out of the party,” said analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. “If you look at what Apple has done with wearables, it’s a missing piece of the puzzle for Google.”
Google’s pledge that it won’t sell ads using Fitbit health data is a continuation of promises previously made by Fitbit.
Privacy experts, though, were sceptical.
Consumer Reports health privacy expert Dena Mendelsohn said she is concerned that people enrolled in wellness programs through their employers that use Fitbit devices could lose control over their data.
“While a person may not have had concerns about Fitbit holding their data, they may have concerns over Google holding their data,” Mendelsohn said.
Google’s promise is also unlikely to stop it from gathering other information from Fitbit devices.
For example, Fitbit has GPS models that could track users’ locations. That could help Google know that a runner stopped at a coffee shop on the way home. Google could then display ads for rival coffee shops.
More important, having a Google device on the wrist could drive wearers to use Google services, even more, giving the company more ways to sell ads.
The deal is likely to face scrutiny from state and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust authorities, who are already investigating Google and other big tech companies over whether they have abused their market power.
“Why should Google be permitted to acquire even more companies while they’re under DOJ antitrust investigation?” Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, tweeted.
Still, analysts at equity research firm Cowen said they believe regulators are unlikely to block the deal because of Fitbit’s relatively small size and its focus on hardware.
While Fitbit all but created the field, it has been shredded by the competition. It was worth nearly $10 billion after it went public in 2015. But its value this week is well below $2 billion.
When rumours of a potential buyout by Google surfaced earlier this week, Fitbit stock soared almost 30%. It jumped nearly 16% more Friday.
Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet, will pay $7.35 per share. Alphabet stock gained about 1%.
“With Google’s resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone,” Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park said in a statement.
Fitbit has been expanding its partnerships with major health care companies such as Humana to encourage healthier living.
John Hancock announced incentives last year on its insurance policies for people willing to share data gathered by health-monitoring devices. It offers free Fitbits to participants.
Last year, Fitbit acquired a health coaching business that helps people manage conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.
Fitbit ranks fourth in global shipments of digital watches, fitness trackers and other wrist-worn devices, according to research firm IDC. Chinese companies Xiaomi and Huawei were No. 1 and No. 3, Apple was No. 2, and Samsung came in fifth.

Event organisers say their selection of Dubai as host reflects a vote of confidence that this oil-rich Emirati sheikhdom can be a global hub for innovation. They also expressed hope that bringing together tomorrow’s scientists and engineers will help develop technologies to solve the world’s most pressing issues, particularly those related to the environment.
Dean Kamen, founder of first Global Challenge, said the Middle East represents a part of the world where “the adults have not learned how to play nice with each other” and it was up to young people to fix humanity’s self-inflicted wounds.
“We are in an accelerating race toward catastrophe, whether it’s global warning, melting of the (polar ice) caps, bird flu, terrorism — you name it, we’re worried about it. The solution to most of the world’s grand challenges depends on better technologies than we have today,” he said.
“This globe of ours is on life support, so the thought is we get every kid in every country to focus on learning how to use technology, but focus on using it as a tool and not a weapon,” he explained.
The unofficial “Robotics Olympics” seeks to encourage young people to pursue subjects known as STEM — science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Teams of four to five students, aged 14-18, each received a kit of rods, wheels, wires and other raw materials with which to assemble their roving robots. Their task: Collect orange balls of various sizes from a playing field, which represented human-created pollutants in the ocean. Some devised robots for scooping, while others snatched up and fired the balls through the air into the receptacles.
The teams then formed “alliances,” each with up of four nations, to battle their way to the final round. Overall, 1,500 students took part.
A team captained by Belarus, and including Syrian refugees, eventually won the gold medal, edging out a team captained by Israel in a dramatic final match. But organisers stressed a message of unity, not conflict.
“The kids get it. To them this isn’t a competition; this is a ‘coop-etition.’ This is a celebration of technology,” said Kamen.
Previous events tackled challenges related to clean water access and sustainable energy.
Robotics is a natural fit for Dubai, a city that’s already testing driverless cars and taxis. It’s become a magnet for international entrepreneurs, with an entire zone called “Internet City” that’s packed with high-tech startups. Next October, Dubai will host the Expo 2020, welcoming technological breakthroughs from around the world.
“If we are to become the city of the future, we need to have the right talent from around the world,” said Omar Al-Olama, the 29-year-old Emirati Minister of Artificial Intelligence, the world’s first such minister. “Artificial intelligence is based on data. Data is what drives all these new technologies. We have the holy grail of data. We have 200 nationalities represented in this country.”
FedEx recently announced Dubai would become the first city outside the US to test Roxo, an autonomous delivery device that can travel on sidewalks and even unpaved surfaces.
Roxo made its debut international appearance at this week’s robotics contest, drawing the interest of the tech-savvy teens hailing from places as diverse as Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. They mingled in Dubai’s Festival City, exchanging experiences and forming friendships while talking shop about their gadgets.
“We didn’t do so well in the matches because we had a lot of trouble with the control hub, but it doesn’t matter, we had a lot of fun,” said Stefan Sijbesma, 17, from the Netherlands. “For me, robotics is really important because it really helped me choose what I want to study and what I want to do with my life.”
The three-day tournament had a festival-like atmosphere to it, with announcers and commentators analysing the action in sports-broadcast style and fans waving flags and banners supporting their teams. The pavilion floor was filled with facts about the millions of tons of pollutants threatening the world’s oceans, and featured slogans such as “united by land, connected by oceans” and “together we turn the tide on pollution.”
As the nail-biting results were being announced, the Israelis huddled with their Ugandan teammates before embracing the winning team in a feel-good ending.
“I can’t believe it, it’s a miracle,” said Yamen Najjar, manager of Team Hope, which represents the Syrian refugees and was part of the winning alliance. “It was a very difficult competition for us, we faced a lot of problems, but we didn’t lose hope.”
Outgoing US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who’d made the original announcement that Dubai would host the event earlier this year in a surprise visit to the World Government Summit, was on hand. Perry said he’s followed the robotics tournaments since 2002 when, as governor of Texas, he attended one of the regional competitions in Houston and was “blown away” by the passions and abilities of the young contestants.
But he said he found their camaraderie even more impressive.
“It is stunning what these young people are doing,” Perry said. “Where the adults may have failed in the standpoint of international diplomacy, these young people may accomplish, and if that’s the case maybe that is the most important thing that comes out of this.”

The 25-year-old university dropout Boyan Slat founded The Ocean Cleanup to develop and deploy a system he invented when he was 18 that catches plastic waste floating in the ocean.
On Saturday he unveiled the next step in his fight: A floating solar-powered device that he calls the “Interceptor” that scoops plastic out of rivers as it drifts past.
“We need to close the tap, which means preventing more plastic from reaching the ocean in the first place,” he said, calling rivers “the arteries that carry the trash from land to sea.”
Slat’s organisation has in the past drawn criticism for focusing only on the plastic trash already floating in the world’s oceans. Experts say 9 million tons (8 million metric tons) of plastic waste, including plastic bottles, bags, toys and other items, flows annually into the ocean from beaches, rivers and creeks, endangering marine life in the oceans, including whales.
Three of the machines have already been deployed to Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam — and a fourth is heading to the Dominican Republic, he said.
Izham Hashim from the government of Selangor state in Malaysia was present at the launch and said he was happy with the machine.
“It has been used for 1 1/2 months in the river and it’s doing very well, collecting the plastic bottles and all the rubbish,” he said.
Slat said he believes 1,000 rivers are responsible for some 80% of plastic pouring into the world’s oceans and he wants to tackle them all in the next five years.
“This is not going to be easy, but imagine if we do get this done,” he told his audience of enthusiastic supporters, who whooped, clapped and cheered his announcements. “We could truly make our oceans clean again.”
Slat used his live-streamed unveiling to appeal for support from countries committing to clean up their rivers and businesses prepared to inject funding and help with the operation of the devices.
The vessel is designed to be moored in rivers and has a shaped nose to deflect away larger floating debris like tree trunks. The interceptors work by guiding plastic waste into an opening in its bow, a conveyor belt then carries the trash into the guts of the machine where it is dropped into dumpsters. The interceptor sends a text message to local operators that can come and empty it when it’s full.
Slat showed off how it worked by dumping hundreds of yellow rubber ducks into the water at the launch event in Rotterdam’s port. The interceptor caught nearly all of them.
The machines currently cost about 700,000 euros ($775,600), but Slat said the cost will likely drop as production increases.
Jan van Franeker of the Wageningen Marine Research Institute has been critical of The Ocean Cleanup in the past, but said the new device looks promising.
“I am really happy they finally moved toward the source of the litter,” he said in a telephone interview. “The design, from what I can see, looks pretty good.”
Slat argued that the economic impact of not picking plastic out of rivers is higher than the cost of buying and using the machines.
“Deploying interceptors is even cheaper than deploying nothing at all,” he said.

320,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-plans-to-send-water-hunting-robot-to-moon-surface-in-2022/,"WASHINGTON: NASA will send a golf cart-sized robot to the moon in 2022 to search for deposits of water below the surface, an effort to evaluate the vital resource ahead of a planned human return to the moon in 2024 to possibly use it for astronauts to drink and to make rocket fuel, the US space agency said on Friday.
The VIPER robot will drive for miles (km) on the dusty lunar surface to get a closer look at what NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine has touted for months: underground pockets of “hundreds of millions of tons of water ice” that could help turn the moon into a jumping-off point to Mars.
“VIPER is going to assess where the water ice is. We’re going to be able to characterize the water ice, and ultimately drill,” Bridenstine said on Friday at the International Astronautical Congress in Washington. “Why is this important? Because water ice represents something significant. Life support.”
VIPER stands for Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover.
The rover is expected to arrive on the moon‘s south polar region in December 2022, carrying four instruments to sample lunar soil for traces of hydrogen and oxygen – the basic components of water that can be separated and synthesized into fuel for a planned fleet of commercial lunar launch vehicles.
In development at NASA‘s Ames Research Center in California, the VIPER robot will log “about 100 days of data that will be used to inform the first global water resource maps of the moon,” NASA said in announcing the plans.
NASA is in the process of kickstarting its Artemis program, an accelerated mission to put people back on the moon for the first time since the 1970s to train and prove technologies that would later be sent on a Mars mission.
Scientists have eyed lunar water as a key resource for enabling long-duration astronaut missions on the moon, though its form and exact amount are unknown. VIPER will aim to find out.
NASA crashed a rocket onto the moon‘s south pole in 2009 to confirm traces of lunar water ice in the plume of dust kicked up upon impact.

321,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/facebook-launches-a-news-section/,"
Over the course of its 15 year history, Facebook has variously ignored news organisations while eating their advertising revenue, courted them for video projects it subsequently abandoned, and then largely cut their stories out of its newsfeeds.
Now it plans to pay them for news headlines — reportedly millions of dollars in some cases.
Enter the “News Tab,” a new section in the Facebook mobile app that will display headlines — and nothing else — from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, Business Insider, NBC, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times, among others. Local stories from several of the largest US cities will also make the grade; headlines from smaller towns are on their way, Facebook says.
Tapping on those headlines will take you directly to publisher websites or apps, if you have any installed. Which is more or less what publishers have been requesting from Facebook for years.
It’s potentially a big step for a platform that has long struggled with both stamping out misinformation and making nice with struggling purveyors of news. Though media watchers remain skeptical that Facebook is really committed to helping sustain the news industry.
Facebook declined to say who is getting paid and how much, saying only that it will be paying “a range of publishers for access to all of their content.” Just last year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wasn’t sure it “makes sense ” to pay news outlets for their material.
But now, as Zuckerberg told The Associated Press in an interview, “there’s an opportunity to set up new long term, stable financial relationships with publishers.”
News executives have long been unhappy about the extent to which digital giants like Facebook make use of their stories — mostly by displaying headlines and short summaries when users post news links. A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress this year would grant an antitrust exemption to news companies, letting them band together to negotiate payments from the big tech platforms.
“It’s a good direction that they’re willing for the first time to value and pay for news content,” said David Chavern, head of the News Media Alliance, a publisher trade group. “The trouble is that most publishers aren’t included.”
Zuckerberg said Facebook aims to set up partnerships with a “wide range” of publishers.
“We think that this is an opportunity to build something quite meaningful here,” he said. “We’re going to have journalists curating this, we are really focused on provenance and branding and where the stories come from.”
In a statement, the Los Angeles Times said it expects the Facebook effort will help expand its readership and digital subscribers.
Facebook killed its previous effort to curate news, the ill-fated Trending topics, in 2018. Conservatives complained about political bias, leading Facebook to fire its human editors and automate the section until it began recycling false stories, after which the social giant shut it down entirely.
But what happens when the sprawling social network plays news editor? An approach that sends people news based on what they’ve liked before could over time elevate stories with greater “emotional resonance” over news that “allows public discourse to take place,” said Edward Wasserman, dean of the graduate journalism program at the University of California-Berkeley.
“It deepens my concern that they’ll be applying Facebook logic to news judgment,” he added.
The social network has come under criticism for its news judgment recently. In September, it removed a fact-check from Science Feedback that called out an anti-abortion activist’s video for claiming that abortion is never medically necessary. Republican senators had complained about the fact check.
Facebook says a small team of “seasoned” journalists it employs will choose the headlines for the “Today’s Story” section of the tab, designed to “catch you up” on the day’s news. The rest of the news section will be populated with stories algorithmically based on users’ interests.
That sounds similar to the approach taken by Apple News , a free iPhone app. But Apple’s effort to contract with news organisations has been slow to take off. Apple News Plus, a $10-a-month paid version, remains primarily a hub for magazines; other news publishers have largely sat it out.
Apple’s service reportedly offered publishers only half the revenue it pulled in from subscriptions, divided according to how popular publishers were with readers.

322,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/fossil-trove-shows-lifes-fast-recovery-after-big-extinction/,"NEW YORK: A remarkable trove of fossils from Colorado has revealed details of how mammals grew larger and plants evolved after the cataclysm that killed the dinosaurs.
The thousands of specimens let scientists trace that history over a span of 1 million years, a mere eyeblink in Earth’s lifespan.
Sixty-six million years ago, a large meteorite smashed into what is now the Yucatan Peninsula of southeastern Mexico. It unleashed broiling waves of heat and filled the sky with aerosols that blotted out the sun for months, killing off plants and the animals that depended on them.
More than three-quarters of species on Earth died out.
But life came back, and land mammals began to expand from being small creatures into the wide array of forms we see today — including us.
So the new find taps into “the origin of the modern world,” said Tyler Lyson, an author of a paper reporting the fossil finds Thursday in the journal Science.
The fossils were recovered from an area of steep bluffs covering about 10 square miles (17 square kilometres) near Colorado Springs, starting three years ago.
Lyson, of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, found little in that area when he followed the standard practice of scanning for bits of bone. But that changed when he began looking instead for rocks that can form around bone. When the rocks were broken open, skulls and other fossils within were revealed.
Lyson said it’s not clear how wide a geographic region the fossils’ story of recovery applies to, but that he thinks they show what happened over North America.
“We just know so little about this everywhere on the globe,” he said. “At least now we have at one spot a fantastic record.”

Experts not connected to the study were enthusiastic.
It’s “an unparalleled documentary of how life on land recovered” after the asteroid impact, said P. David Polly of Indiana University in Bloomington. “The sheer number of fossil specimens and the quality of their preservation are exceptional” for this time period, he said.
The fossils’ story certainly represents what happened in central North America and perhaps more broadly, he wrote in an email.
Stephanie Smith of the Field Museum in Chicago said the study’s detailed focus on a single area can help scientists understand the complexity of recovery when combined with results from elsewhere.
Scientists have previously found little evidence about what happened in the aftermath of the meteorite crash, especially on land, said Jin Meng of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The new work, he said in an email, appears to provide “the best record on Earth to date.”
The study reports on hundreds of mammal fossils representing 16 species and more than 6,000 plant fossils. Researchers also analyzed thousands of pollen grains to see what plants were alive at various times. Analysis of leaves indicated several warming periods during the period.
Here’s the recovery story the fossils tell:
The area had been a forest before the meteorite hit, home to dinosaurs like T. rex and mammals no bigger than about 17 pounds (8 kilograms).
Soon after the disaster, the environment was blanketed with ferns and the biggest mammal around was about as heavy as a rat. The world was in a warming period, as documented in previous studies.
By about 100,000 years after the meteorite impact, the forest was dominated by palm trees and mammals had grown to the weight of raccoons, almost as big as before the meteorite crash. “That’s a pretty rapid recovery, or at least one aspect of recovery,” Lyson said.
By 300,000 years, the walnut tree family had diversified, and the biggest mammals were plant eaters about as heavy as a large beaver. Based on other studies of their diet, they may have evolved along with those trees, Lyson said.
By 700,000 years, the fossil record shows the first known appearance of legume plants, the family that includes peas and beans. And it reveals the two largest mammals found in the study, with the larger one weighing about 100 pounds (50 kilograms), roughly like a wolf. That is about 100 times heavier than the mammals that survived the extinction, “which I think is pretty fast” for growth, Lyson said.
What drove mammals to get bigger? The main factor was the disappearance of the dinosaurs, leaving an ecological niche to be filled, he said. But the quality and types of food on the landscape probably also played a role, he said. The simultaneous appearance of legume plants and bigger mammals suggests the plants may have provided a “protein bar moment,” Lyson said.
He said the mammals were creatures that evolved from animals that had survived extinction or those that immigrated from elsewhere.
Zhe-Xi Luo of the University of Chicago, who did not participate in the work, said the report is remarkable for tying together records for plants, mammals and temperature, giving a “holistic picture.”
Scientists expected mammals to recover after the dinosaur extinctions, he said, and the new work “is a huge step forward in getting a firm understanding about just how it happened.”

Able to crack random number problem in minutes
Breakthrough compared to first manned flight
IBM : Google hypes achievement, risks misleading public

BERLIN/SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Wednesday it had achieved a breakthrough in computing research by using a quantum computer to solve in minutes a complex problem that would take today’s most powerful supercomputer thousands of years to crack.

Google researchers expect that quantum computers within a few years will fuel advancements in fields such as artificial intelligence, materials science, and chemistry. The company is racing rivals including IBM Corp and Microsoft Corp to be the first to commercialize the technology and sell it through its cloud computing business.
“We’re hoping that when people start using this and looking at performance stability and cloud interface, they’ll get really excited about what we have to offer at Google,” John Martinis, the company’s chief scientist for quantum hardware, told reporters.
The breakthrough was described in a paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5#Sec4 published in science journal Nature. It followed weeks of controversy since a draft leaked over whether Google‘s claim of “quantum supremacy” was valid.
IBM said a supercomputer employing a different set-up could solve the same challenge in under three days, while chipmaker Intel said “quantum practicality” remained years away.
Google defended its position, but did not dispute rivals’ contentions. It has manufactured a handful of chips with 54 ‘qubits’, vastly more powerful than the standard 64-bit chip in many consumer devices. However, for the technology to be useful to customers it would need to make chips with thousands of qubits.
Martinis said Google sees “a pathway” to a computer with 1,000 qubits and expressed confidence that it had a reliable process to make its new chip, dubbed Sycamore.
The US and Chinese governments have led in the burgeoning quantum technology field, pledging billions of dollars in funding to corporate and state researchers to fast-track quantum development and mitigate possible issues, including the tech’s expected ability to break digital encryption.
Google has been among the beneficiaries of the American support. “The United States has taken a great leap forward in quantum computing,” said U.S. chief technology officer Michael Kratsios on Wednesday.

Long-held dream

For decades, computer scientists have sought to harness quantum physics, laws governing the behavior of particles that are smaller than atoms and can simultaneously exist in different states.
Quantum bits, or qubits, can be set to one and zero at the same time, unlike today’s computer bits that are either ones or zeros. This superposition property multiplies exponentially as qubits become entangled with each other, meaning the more qubits connected, the vastly more powerful a quantum computer becomes.
But there is a catch: Quantum researchers need to cool qubits to about absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius or -460 degrees Fahrenheit) to limit vibration – or “noise” – that causes errors in calculations. It is in this challenging task that Google, which has designed much of its own electronics and used liquid helium for cooling, has made significant progress.
CEO Sundar Pichai compared the achievement to building the first rocket to leave Earth’s atmosphere and touch the edge of space, an advance that brought interplanetary travel into the realm of the possible.
“For those of us working in science and technology, it’s the ‘hello world’ moment we’ve been waiting for – the most meaningful milestone to date in the quest to make quantum computing a reality,” Pichai wrote in a blog https://blog.google/perspectives/sundar-pichai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means.
Sycamore, measuring about 10 mm (0.39 inch) across, is made using aluminum and indium parts sandwiched between two silicon wafers. In their experiment this year, the researchers were able to get 53 of Sycamore’s qubits to interact in a quantum state.
They then had the quantum computer detect patterns in a series of seemingly random numbers, and it succeeded in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. They estimated that the same problem would take 10,000 years for a Summit supercomputer – the most powerful in the world today – to solve.

Hold on a qubit
While the peer-reviewed research has drawn plaudits, with MIT’s William D. Oliver comparing it to the Wright brothers’ first flights, skeptics say Google is over-selling its achievement.
IBM said a supercomputer with additional disk storage can solve the random number problem in at most 2-1/2 days and with greater accuracy. It also said Google risked misleading the public by implying the new-style computers would replace existing ones.
“Quantum computers will never reign ‘supreme’ over classical computers, but will rather work in concert with them, since each have their unique strengths,” Dario Gil, director of research at IBM, wrote in a blog https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy.
Torsten Siebert, manager of the quantum computing research program at Germany’s Fraunhofer Society, agreed that “progress was likely to be achieved through such hybrid combinations.”
Researchers also have expressed concern about quantum computers being used, for example, to unseal secure data and passwords or enable new forms of surveillance.
But before quantum computers can break codes, security experts have plenty of time to adapt, Martinis said.
“We’re pretty confident we’ll all stay safe and secure in the future,” he said.

324,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/is-the-stethoscope-dying-high-tech-rivals-pose-a-threat/,"
CHICAGO: Two centuries after its invention, the stethoscope — the very symbol of the medical profession — is facing an uncertain prognosis.

It is threatened by hand-held devices that are also pressed against the chest but rely on ultrasound technology, artificial intelligence and smartphone apps instead of doctors’ ears to help detect leaks, murmurs, abnormal rhythms and other problems in the heart, lungs and elsewhere. Some of these instruments can yield images of the beating heart or create electrocardiogram graphs.
Dr Eric Topol, a world-renowned cardiologist, considers the stethoscope obsolete, nothing more than a pair of “rubber tubes.”
It “was OK for 200 years,” Topol said. But “we need to go beyond that. We can do better.”
In a longstanding tradition, nearly every US medical school presents incoming students with a white coat and stethoscope to launch their careers. It’s more than symbolic — stethoscope skills are still taught, and proficiency is required for doctors to get their licenses.
Over the last decade, though, the tech industry has downsized ultrasound scanners into devices resembling TV remotes. It has also created digital stethoscopes that can be paired with smartphones to create moving pictures and readouts.

Proponents say these devices are nearly as easy to use as stethoscopes and allow doctors to watch the body in motion and actually see things such as leaky valves. “There’s no reason you would listen to sounds when you can see everything,” Topol said.
At many medical schools, it’s the newer devices that really get students’ hearts pumping.
“Wow!” ”Whoa!” ”This is awesome,” Indiana University medical students exclaimed in a recent class as they learned how to use a hand-held ultrasound device on a classmate, watching images of his lub-dubbing heart on a tablet screen.
The Butterfly iQ device, made by based by Guilford, Connecticut-based Butterfly Network Inc, went on the market last year. An update will include artificial intelligence to help users position the probe and interpret the images.
Students at the Indianapolis-based medical school, one of the nation’s largest, learn stethoscope skills but also get training in hand-held ultrasound in a programme launched there last year by Dr Paul Wallach, an executive associate dean. He created a similar programme five years ago at the Medical College of Georgia and predicts that within the next decade, hand-held ultrasound devices will become part of the routine physical exam, just like the reflex hammer.
The devices advance “our ability to take peek under the skin into the body,” he said. But Wallach added that, unlike some of his colleagues, he isn’t ready to declare the stethoscope dead. He envisions the next generation of physicians wearing “a stethoscope around the neck and an ultrasound in the pocket.”
Modern-day stethoscopes bear little resemblance to the first stethoscope, invented in the early 1800s by Frenchman Rene Laennec, but they work essentially the same way.
Laennec’s creation was a hollow tube of wood, almost a foot long, that made it easier to hear heart and lung sounds than pressing an ear against the chest. Rubber tubes, earpieces and the often cold metal attachment that is placed against the chest came later, helping to amplify the sounds.
When the stethoscope is pressed against the body, sound waves make the diaphragm — the flat metal disc part of the device — and the bell-shaped underside vibrate. That channels the sound waves up through the tubes to the ears. Conventional stethoscopes typically cost under $200, compared with at least a few thousand dollars for some of the high-tech devices.
But picking up and interpreting body sounds is subjective and requires a sensitive ear — and a trained one.
With medical advances and competing devices over the past few decades, “the old stethoscope is kind of falling on hard times in terms of rigorous training,” said Dr James Thomas, a cardiologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. “Some recent studies have shown that graduates in internal medicine and emergency medicine may miss as many of half of murmurs using a stethoscope.”
Northwestern is involved in testing new technology created by Eko, a Berkeley, California-based maker of smart stethoscopes. To improve detection of heart murmurs, Eko is developing artificial intelligence algorithms for its devices, using recordings of thousands of heartbeats. The devices produce a screen message telling the doctor whether the heart sounds are normal or if murmurs are present.
Dennis Callinan, a retired Chicago city employee with heart disease, is among the study participants. At age 70, he has had plenty of stethoscope exams but said he feels no nostalgia for the devices.
“If they can get a better reading using the new technology, great,” Callinan said.
Chicago paediatrician Dr Dave Drelicharz has been in practice for just over a decade and knows the allure of newer devices. But until the price comes down, the old stalwart “is still your best tool,” Drelicharz said. Once you learn to use the stethoscope, he said, it “becomes second nature.”
“During my work hours in my office, if I don’t have it around my shoulders,” he said, “it’s as though I was feeling almost naked.”

America’s first female spacewalker from 35 years ago, Kathy Sullivan, was delighted. She said it’s good to finally have enough women in the astronaut corps and trained for spacewalking for this to happen.
“We’ve got qualified women running the control, running space centres, commanding the station, commanding spaceships and doing spacewalks,” Sullivan told The Associated Press earlier this week. “And golly, gee whiz, every now and then there’s more than one woman in the same place.”
President Donald Trump put in a congratulatory call from the White House to mark “this historic event … truly historic.”
“What you do is incredible. You’re very brave people,” Trump told them as they wrapped up their spacewalk.
Replied Meir: “We don’t want to take too much credit because there have been many others — female spacewalkers — before us. This is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time … For us, this is really just us doing our job.”
NASA leaders, Girl Scouts and others also cheered Koch and Meir on. Parents also sent in messages of thanks and encouragement via social media. NASA included some in its TV coverage. “Go girls go,” two young sisters wrote on a sign in crayon. A group of middle schoolers held a long sign reading “The sky is not the limit!!”
At the same time, many expressed hope this will become routine in the future.
Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a three-time spacewalker who looked on from Mission Control in Houston, added: “Hopefully, this will now be considered normal.”
NASA originally wanted to conduct an all-female spacewalk last spring but did not have enough medium-size suits ready to go until summer. Koch and Meir were supposed to install more new batteries in a spacewalk next week but ventured out three days earlier to deal with an equipment failure that occurred over the weekend. It was the second such failure of a battery charger this year, puzzling engineers and putting a hold on future battery installations for the solar power system.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine watched the big event unfold from Washington headquarters.
“We have the right people doing the right job at the right time,” he said. “They are an inspiration to people all over the world including me. And we’re very excited to get this mission underway.”
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sent congratulations to Koch and Meir “for leaving their mark on history” and tweeted that they’re an inspiration to women and girls across America.
The spacewalkers’ main job was to replace the faulty 19-year-old old charge-regulating device — the size of a big, bulky box — for one of the three new batteries that were installed last week by Koch and Andrew Morgan. As the seven-hour spacewalk drew to a close, Mission Control declared success, informing the astronauts that the new charger seemed to be working and the space station was back to full power. The women dragged in the broken unit so it can be returned to Earth early next year for analysis.
“Jessica and Christina, we are so proud of you,” said Morgan, one of four astronauts inside. He called them his “astrosisters.”
Spacewalking is widely considered the most dangerous assignment in orbit. Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, who operated the station’s robot arm from inside during Friday’s spacewalk, almost drowned in 2013 when his helmet flooded with water from his suit’s cooling system.
“Everyone ought to be sending some positive vibes by way of airwaves to space for these two top-notch spacewalkers,” Dyson said early in the spacewalk.
Meir, a marine biologist making her spacewalking debut, became the 228th person in the world to conduct a spacewalk and the 15th woman. It was the fourth spacewalk for Koch, an electrical engineer who is seven months into an 11-month mission that will be the longest ever by a woman. Both are members of NASA’s Astronaut Class of 2013, the only one equally split between women and men.
Pairing up for a spacewalk was especially meaningful for Koch and Meir; they’re close friends. They’re also both former Girl Scouts.
It took two decades for women to catch up with men in the spacewalking arena.
The world’s first spacewalker on March 18, 1965, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, died last week. NASA astronaut Ed White became the first US spacewalker less than three months after Leonov’s feat. Women did not follow out the hatch until 1984. The first was Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya. Sullivan followed three months later.
Friday’s milestone spacewalk was the 421st for team Earth.

326,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/us-astronauts-embark-on-the-first-all-female-spacewalk/,"US astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir made history on Friday when they stepped outside the International Space Station (ISS) on the first all-female spacewalk.
The much-anticipated milestone for NASA was achieved during a relatively routine mission to swap faulty batteries on the station’s exterior.
Koch and Meir, clad in white spacesuits and tethered by cords to the station some 254 miles (408 km) above Earth, stepped into outer space at 7:38 am Eastern time (1138 GMT) to replace a faulty power unit designed to help condition energy stored from the station’s solar panels, NASA announced online as it showed live video of the action.
The mission, expected to last nearly five hours, follows a first attempt at an all-female spacewalk in March. It was called off because one of the astronaut’s medium-sized spacesuits was not configured and ready for the journey.
Astronauts on the space station, which became operational in 2000, have tallied 221 maintenance spacewalks, 43 of which included women astronauts, according to NASA.
Friday’s spacewalk, formally called extravehicular activities, is in line with the US space agency’s aim to ramp up inclusivity in space.
Koch is scheduled set to complete the longest single space flight by a woman by remaining in orbit aboard the station until February 2020. She said gender milestones such as the spacewalk are significant.
“There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories from people who look like them, and I think that it’s an important aspect of the story to tell,” she said at a NASA briefing in Houston this month.
Sandra Magnus, a former NASA astronaut who spent 136 days on the International Space Station, told Reuters she did not want events like Friday’s spacewalk to become gimmicks.
“We want them to happen because people have the skill sets and they’re available to do the job,” said Magnus.
“On the other hand, it’s important for young women to see women role models doing extraordinary things,” she said. “So there’s two sides of the coin. You want it to be normal but yet you want it to be special.”

327,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/facebook-ceo-defends-refusal-to-take-down-some-content/,"WASHINGTON: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday defended the social media platform’s refusal to take down content it considers newsworthy “even if it goes against our standards.” But while he promoted free expression, limitations were place on coverage of his remarks at Georgetown University.
Reporters were not allowed to ask questions — only students were given that chance, filtered by a moderator. Facebook and Georgetown barred news organizations from filming. Instead organizers provided a livestream on Georgetown’s social media site and made available video shot by Facebook.
“It’s quite ironic,” said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute and a former state prosecutor. More generally, she said of Facebook, “The key to free expression is to not have one company control the flow of speech to more than 2 billion people, using algorithms that amplify disinformation in order to maximize profits.”
Facebook, Google, Twitter and other companies are trying to oversee internet content while also avoiding infringing on First Amendment rights. The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence. The shift follows mass shootings in which the suspects have posted racist screeds online or otherwise expressed hateful views or streamed images of attacks.
Facebook also has come under criticism for not doing enough to filter out phoney political ads.
“Right now, we’re doing a very good job at getting everyone mad at us,” Zuckerberg told the packed hall at Georgetown.
He said serious threats to expression are coming from places such as China, where social media platforms used by protesters are censored, and from court decisions restricting the location of internet users’ data in certain countries.
“I’m here today because I believe that we must continue to stand for free expression,” he said. People of varied political beliefs are trying to define expansive speech as dangerous because it could bring results they don’t accept, Zuckerberg said. “I personally believe this is more dangerous to democracy in the long term than almost any speech.”
Taking note of mounting criticism of the market dominance of Facebook and other tech giants, Zuckerberg acknowledged the companies’ centralized power but said it’s also “decentralized by putting it directly into people’s hands. … Giving people a voice and broader inclusion go hand in hand.”
John Stanton, a former fellow at Georgetown who heads a group called the “Save Journalism Project,” called the CEO’s appearance “a joke.”
Zuckerberg “is the antithesis of free expression,” Stanton said in a statement. “He’s thrown free speech, public education and democracy to the wayside in his thirst for power and profit.”
The social media giant, with nearly 2.5 billion users around the globe, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of data privacy scandals, including lapses in opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump’s 2016 campaign.
Facebook and other social media platforms have drawn accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that their platforms are steeped in anti-conservative bias.
Zuckerberg recently fell into a tiff with Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, who ran a fake political ad on Facebook taking aim at the CEO. Warren has proposed breaking up big tech companies. With the phoney ad, she was protesting Facebook’s policy of not fact-checking politicians’ speech or ads in the same way it enlists outside parties to fact-check news stories and other posts.
“We think people should be able to see for themselves,” Zuckerberg responded Thursday on the fact-checking issue. “If content is newsworthy, we don’t take it down even if it goes against our standards.”
The social media network also rebuffed requests that it remove a misleading video ad from Trump’s re-election campaign targeting Democrat Joe Biden.
A spokesman for Biden said Zuckerberg’s speech was an effort “to cloak Facebook’s policy in a feigned concern for free expression.”
“Facebook has chosen to sell Americans’ personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans,” campaign spokesman Bill Russo said in a statement.
Several of the students’ questions to Zuckerberg at Georgetown pointed up the conflict. One asked, if Facebook supports free speech, “why is conservative content disproportionately censored?” But another asserted that the policy of not fact-checking political ads is pro-conservative.
“I think it would be hard to be biased against both sides,” Zuckerberg replied, smiling.
Asked about the handling of questions, Facebook spokeswoman Ruchika Budhjara said, “They were submitted by students as they walked into the room. And they’re being picked at random by Georgetown.”

328,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-unveils-new-spacesuit-prototypes-for-missions/,"
WASHINGTON: NASA on Tuesday showed off two new spacesuits tailored for future moonwalking astronauts, signalling the development of a crucial component to the space agency’s accelerated drive to return to the moon by 2024.
Two NASA engineers strutted on a stage inside the agency’s Washington, DC headquarters, donning the new spacesuits, modelling and doing squats and crunches in front of a crowd of students and reporters to reveal what the first zero-gravity space-wear under NASA’s Artemis moon program would look like.

“This is the first suit we’ve designed in about 40 years,” Chris Hansen, a manager at NASA’s spacesuit design office, said.
“What you saw today was a prototype of the pressure garment. The life support system is back in a lab in Houston,” he said. “We want systems that allow our astronauts to be scientists on the surface of the moon”
The Trump administration in March directed NASA to land humans on the moon by 2024, accelerating a goal to colonize the moon as a staging ground for eventual missions to Mars.
One suit of orange fabric will be worn by astronauts when inside the spacecraft. Astronauts will wear a much bigger mostly white suit on the lunar surface.
The new suits make it much easier to walk, bend and squat when walking on the lunar surface, Amy Ross, NASA’s lead spacesuit engineer, said.
“Basically, my job is to take a basketball, shape it like a human, keep them alive in a harsh environment, and give them the mobility to do their job,” she said.
The new suits come as a much-needed upgrade to NASA’s astronaut wardrobe. Astronauts Christina Koch and Anne McClain were slated in March to conduct the first-ever all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station, but the mission was called off because there weren’t enough spacesuits available on the station for both of them.
Another attempt for the first all-female spacewalk, a roughly six-hour crawl on the exterior of the space station to install new batteries, is back on for Thursday, NASA said in a news release on Tuesday.

329,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/despite-defections-facebook-officially-launches-libra/,"NEW YORK: Facebook officially moved forward with its plans Monday to create a new digital currency called Libra, despite several high-profile defections from the project and intense criticism from US regulators and politicians.
The Libra Association, the nonprofit that will govern the currency, officially signed on 21 charter members on Monday at the organization’s inaugural meeting in Geneva. Originally the Libra Association had 27 potential members, but several companies dropped out in recent days, including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal.
Most of the remaining members of the Libra Association consist of venture capital firms, who often have an eye on emerging technologies and align with Facebook’s interests, as well as nonprofits. But some larger companies who are now members of the association include Uber, Lyft, Spotify and European telecommunications company Vodafone. The association said in a statement that an unnamed additional 180 entities have expressed interest and have met the initial requirements to join.
Facebook has faced criticism since the summer when it unveiled plans to create a separate, private currency system to allow users to make cross-border payments more easily. Politicians have said they believe Facebook’s struggles with protecting users’ privacy would spill over into Libra, despite it being a separate organization.
The Menlo Park, California-based company tried to answer those criticisms by creating Libra as a legally separate entity through the Libra Association, and by not owning Libra itself. But Facebook is still involved, even at an arm’s length. The association elected David Marcus, a Facebook executive and co-creator of Libra, as one of the association’s five directors. Katie Haun with Andreessen Horowitz, one of the VC firms that invested in Facebook before it went public, was elected to the board as well.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear in front of the House Financial Services Committee later this month to discuss Libra. That committee is chaired by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, who has been an ardent critic of Libra from its onset.
Facebook and the Libra Association have said they would not start trading or accepting deposits for Libra until they satisfy US regulators concerns. Dante Disparte, Libra’s head of policy and communications, said that the association is now in active talks with regulators to get approval. Facebook has also hired several Washington lobbyists to help alieve regulator and political concerns over Libra.
The other three directors elected to the association’s board were Matthew Davie of Kiva Microfunds, Patrick Ellis with PayU and Wences Casares of Xapo Holdings Ltd.

330,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-launches-satellite-to-explore-where-air-meets-space/,"CAPE CANAVERAL: NASA launched a satellite on Thursday night to explore the mysterious, dynamic region where air meets space.
The satellite — called Icon, short for Ionospheric Connection Explorer — rocketed into orbit following a two-year delay. It was dropped from a plane flying over the Atlantic off the Florida coast.
Five seconds after the satellite’s release, the attached Pegasus rocket ignited, sending Icon on its way.
The ionosphere is the charged part of the upper atmosphere extending several hundred miles (kilometres) up. It’s in constant flux as space weather bombards it from above and Earth weather from below, sometimes disrupting radio communications.
“This protected layer, it’s the top of our atmosphere. It’s our frontier with space,” said NASA’s heliophysics division director, Nicola Fox.
Fox said there’s too much going on in this region to be caused by just the sun. Hurricanes, tornadoes and other extreme weather conditions on Earth are also adding energy, she noted.
The more scientists know, the better spacecraft and astronauts can be protected in orbit through improved forecasting.
The refrigerator-size Icon satellite will study the airglow formed from gases in the ionosphere and also measure the charged environment right around the 360-mile-high (580-kilometre-high) spacecraft.
“It’s a remarkable physics laboratory,” said principal scientist Thomas Immel of the University of California, Berkeley, which is overseeing the two-year mission. He added: “Icon goes where the action is.”
A NASA satellite launched last year, Gold, is also studying the upper atmosphere, but from much higher up. More missions are planned in coming years to study the ionosphere, including from the International Space Station.
Icon should have soared in 2017, but problems with Northrop Grumman’s air-launched Pegasus rocket interfered. Despite the long delay, NASA said the $252 million mission did not exceed its price cap. Northrop Grumman also built the satellite.
During a news conference earlier this week, NASA launch director Omar Baez apologized for the delay.
“We wanted to get things right on this rocket,” Baez said. “We have no second chances on these type of missions.”
He called the launch “an awesome and great one; this one’s been a long time in coming.”
Baez said in the end, everything went well. “This is about as good as it gets,” he said.

331,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nobel-prize-honours-breakthroughs-on-lithium-ion-batteries/,"STOCKHOLM: If you’re reading this on a cell phone or laptop computer, you might thank the three winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on lithium-ion batteries.
The batteries power cell phones, laptops, electric cars and countless other devices of modern life, and could become the foundation for a greener future. Batteries that economically store energy from renewable sources like the wind and sun open up new possibilities to curb global warming.

“This is a highly charged story of tremendous potential,” quipped Olof Ramstrom of the Nobel committee for chemistry.
The prize announced Wednesday went to John B. Goodenough, 97, an engineering professor at the University of Texas; M. Stanley Whittingham, 77, a chemistry professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton; and Akira Yoshino, 71, of chemical company Asahi Kasei Corp. and Meijo University in Japan.
“The heart of the phone is the rechargeable battery. The heart of the electric vehicle is the rechargeable battery. The success and failure of so many new technologies depend on the batteries,” said Alexej Jerschow, a chemist at New York University, whose research focuses on the lithium-ion battery.
Goodenough, who is considered an intellectual giant of solid state chemistry and physics, is the oldest person to ever win a Nobel Prize — edging out Arthur Ashkin, who was 96 when he was awarded the Nobel for physics last year.
Goodenough said he is grateful he was not forced to retire at age 65.
“So I’ve had an extra 33 years to keep working,” he told reporters in London, where he was to accept another prize.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Whittingham said he had no inkling that his work decades ago would have such a profound impact.
“We thought it would be nice and help in a few things, but never dreamed it would revolutionize electronics and everything else,” he said.
And in Japan, Yoshino said he hoped the technology could enable greater adoption of renewable energy sources.
“We must create a society where electricity is generated by renewable in order to resolve the climate change problem,” he said.
The three scientists each had unique breakthroughs that laid the foundation for the development of a commercial rechargeable battery, an alternative to older alkaline batteries containing lead, nickel or zinc that had their origins in the 19th century.
All batteries store chemical energy that can be converted into electricity. But earlier batteries were unsafe, too heavy or not rechargeable — limiting their practical use
In the 1970s, Whittingham, who had researched superconductors at Stanford University, was hired by Exxon at a time when the petroleum giant was investing in research on energy storage.
Whittingham harnessed the tendency of lithium — the lightest metal — to give away its electrons to make a lightweight battery capable of generating just over two volts.
By 1980, building on Whittingham’s work, Goodenough had doubled the capacity of the battery to four volts by using cobalt oxide in the cathode — one of two electrodes, along with the anode, that makes up the ends of a battery.
But that battery remained too unstable for general commercial use. That’s where Yoshino’s work in the 1980s came in. He eliminated the volatile pure lithium from the battery, and instead opted for lithium ions that are safer. He added another material in one electrode that reduced the potential for fires.
This step paved the way for the first lightweight, safe, durable and rechargeable commercial batteries to be built and enter the market in 1991.
Whittingham called the prize a “recognition for the whole field,” adding that “hundreds of people have worked on lithium-ion batteries.”
Building on this foundation could enable broader use of renewable energy sources that generate power at variable times.
“Batteries are the bridge between when the sun is shining and when people need to use the energy,” said Amanda Morris, a chemist at Virginia Tech University.
The three winners will share a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award. Their gold medals and diplomas will be conferred in Stockholm on Dec. 10 — the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel’s death in 1896.
The announcement came on the third day of Nobel week.
On Tuesday, Canadian American James Peebles won the Nobel physics prize for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology together with Swiss scientists Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, who were honoured for finding an exoplanet —  a planet outside our solar system — that orbits a solar-type star.
Americans William G Kaelin Jr and Gregg L Semenza and Britain’s Peter J Ratcliffe won the Nobel for advances in physiology or medicine on Monday. They were cited for their discoveries of “how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.”
Two Nobel literature laureates are to be announced Thursday — one for 2018 and one for 2019 — because last year’s award was suspended after a sex-abuse scandal rocked the Swedish Academy. The coveted Nobel Peace Prize is Friday and the economics award will be announced on Monday.
The chemistry laureates said the field and its applications are still a work in progress.
“Lithium-ion itself is still full of unknowns,” said Yoshino.
He said he visits Goodenough nearly every year in Texas.
“For him, I’m like his son,” he said. “He takes very good care of me.”
Goodenough, in his own way, seemed to return the favour, telling reporters that in all of his 97 years: “What am I most proud of? I don’t know, I would say all my friends.”

Three doctors win Nobel Medicine Prize
Their work centres on the hypoxic response
Work paves way for new treatments for cancer, anaemia
Kaelin: heart racing, Ratcliffe: “honoured and delighted”

STOCKHOLM/LONDON: Two Americans and a Briton won the 2019 Nobel Medicine Prize on Monday for discovering a molecular switch that regulates how cells adapt to fluctuating oxygen levels, opening up new approaches to treating heart failure, anaemia and cancer.
William Kaelin at the US Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School said he was overwhelmed to get a pre-dawn call to say he and two other doctors, Gregg Semenza of Johns Hopkins University and Peter Ratcliffe of Oxford University, had won the 9-million Swedish-crown ($913,000) prize.

“I don’t usually get phone calls at 5 am, but I knew this was ‘Nobel Monday’, so it was either going to be a poorly timed mobile call or extremely good news,” he told Reuters by telephone. “My heart started racing. It was almost surreal.”
Ratcliffe, who is also clinical research director at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said in a statement he was “honoured and delighted at the news”.
The scientists’ work established the basis for understanding of how oxygen levels are sensed by cells – a discovery that is being explored by medical researchers seeking to develop treatments for various diseases that work by either activating or blocking the body’s oxygen-sensing machinery.
Their work centres on the hypoxic response – the way the body reacts to oxygen flux – and “revealed the elegant mechanisms by which our cells sense oxygen levels and respond” said Andrew Murray, an expert at Britain’s University of Cambridge who congratulated the three.
“VITAL INGREDIENT”
“Oxygen is a vital ingredient for the survival of every cell in our bodies. Too little – or too much – can spell disaster. Understanding how evolution has equipped cells to detect and respond to fluctuating oxygen levels helps answer fundamental questions,” said Venki Ramakrishnan, president of Britain’s Royal Society scientific academy.
“As (this) work.. shows us, it also gives insights into the way these processes continue to shape our health and wellbeing.”
Randall Johnson, a professor at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute where the prize is awarded, said it was “a prize that really tells us the fundamental truth about how cells work”.
During exercise, for example, the body uses oxygen at a rapid pace, “and this is a switch that helps the cell figure out how much oxygen it’s getting and how it should behave.”
“If you have a stroke there’s suddenly no oxygen going to the brain… Those cells, if they are going to survive, need to find a way to adapt to that level of oxygen,” he said.
Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes given each year. The prizes for achievements in science, peace and literature have been awarded since 1901 and were created in the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.
Nobel medicine laureates have included scientific greats such as Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, and Karl Landsteiner, who identified separate blood types and so enabled safe transfusions to be widely introduced. Thomas Perlmann, a member of the Nobel Assembly, said he had reached Kaelin by phone early on Monday to tell him on the award. “He was really happy, almost speechless,” Perlmann said.
Last year American James Allison and Japanese Tasuku Honjo won the prize for discoveries about how to harness the immune system in cancer therapies.

A Canadian-American cosmologist and two Swiss scientists split this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for not quite answering those universal questions but getting closer to the cosmic truths.

Canadian-born James Peebles, 84, an emeritus professor at Princeton University, won for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology, about what happened soon after the Big Bang that eventually led to the formation of galaxies and the universe as we know it.
Swiss star-gazers Michel Mayor, 77, and Didier Queloz, 53, both of the University of Geneva, were honoured for finding an exoplanet — a planet outside our solar system — that orbits a sun-like star.
A day of deep astrophysics and talk of extraterrestrial life also included pop humour, with the Nobel Prize committee quoting from the theme song of the American TV sitcom, “The Big Bang Theory,” whose protagonists, Sheldon and Amy, won a physics Nobel in the series finale, and a giggling Peebles referring to singer Bob Dylan.
“This year’s Nobel laureates in physics have painted a picture of the universe far stranger and more wonderful than we ever could have imagined,” said Ulf Danielsson of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in announcing the laureates. “Our view of our place in the universe will never be the same again.”
Peebles’ work is a deeply theoretical look back in time and space at how the universe came to its current form, mostly filled with dark matter and dark energy we can’t even see. It’s probably the first Nobel for purely theoretical cosmology, instead of something observed, noted CalTech physicist Sean Carroll.
Peebles, hailed as one of the most influential cosmologists of his time, who realized the importance of the cosmic radiation background born of the Big Bang, will collect one half of the 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award.
“Much of it will go to charity,” Peebles told colleagues at a Princeton news conference. Then after a pause, he changed that to “Some of it will go to charity. Some of it will go to our children.”
Mayor, who is an astrophysicist, and Queloz, an astronomer who is also at the University of Cambridge in Britain, will share the other half. Their finding of the first planet outside our solar system circling a star like our own made astronomers look harder for life elsewhere in the universe.
“Maybe we can discover some form of life. We don’t know what kind of form,” Mayor said Tuesday as he arrived in Madrid for a scientific speaking engagement. He said scientists “are absolutely certain that a lot of these planets have good conditions for life.”
Mayor and Queloz started a revolution in astronomy when they discovered 51 Pegasi B, a gaseous ball comparable with Jupiter, in 1995 — a time when, as Mayor recalled, “no one knew whether exoplanets existed or not.”
That was “the first step in our search for, ‘Are we alone?'” said astronomer Lisa Kaltenegger, director of the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell University.
More than 4,000 exoplanets have since been found in the Milky Way, and scientists think one out of every four or five stars have planets. “We have 200 billion stars out there in our galaxy alone, so I like our chances,” Kaltenegger said.
Queloz was meeting Tuesday with other academics interested in finding new planets when the press office at Cambridge University interrupted to tell him the big news: He had won the Nobel. He thought it was a joke at first.
“I could barely breathe,” Queloz told The Associated Press. “It’s enormous. It’s beyond usual emotions. My hand was shaking for a long time. I’m trying to digest it.”
Geoff Marcy, who headed one of the teams that rivalled Mayor and Queloz, praised their work. In the 1990s “we were all trying to carry a search for planets without ever thinking we would succeed,” Marcy said. “None of us imagined even finding one, never mind the thousands we found.”
Marcy, who left the University of California Berkeley after accusations of sexual harassment, said he didn’t know if he would have shared in the prize if it weren’t for the scandal.
Swedish Academy member Mats Larsson said this year’s was “one of the easiest physics prizes for a long time to explain.”
That can’t quite be said for Peebles’ theoretical work.
“Jim Peebles absolutely was one of the leaders in trying to understand how did we get here, the nature of cosmology, the nature of the universe at large,” said astronomer Dimitar Sasselov, director of Harvard University’s Origins of Life Initiative.
Peebles’ work, which began in the mid-1960s, set the stage for a “transformation” of cosmology over the last half-century, using theoretical tools and calculations that helped interpret traces from the infancy of the universe, the Nobel committee said.
A clearly delighted Peebles giggled repeatedly during a phone interview with AP, recalling how he answered a 5:30 a.m. phone call from Stockholm thinking that “it’s either something very wonderful or it’s something horrible.”
The astrophysicist, who said his life had suddenly turned topsy-turvy, will make sure he picks up his prize.
“I’ve always loved Bob Dylan,” he said, referring to the singer-songwriter who won the literature prize in 2016 but refused to participate in the Nobel ceremony. “I can’t forgive him for not showing up to the scene of (his) Nobel prize.”
And in a case of life imitating art, Tuesday’s Nobel Prize announcement included the opening lyrics of “The Big Bang Theory” theme song: “Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state, then nearly 14 billion years ago, expansion started.”
The sitcom was a “fantastic achievement” that brought the “world of science to laptops and living rooms around the world,” said Goran Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. So referencing its theme song seemed fitting, he said.
The cash prize comes with a gold medal and a diploma that are received at an elegant ceremony in Stockholm on Dec 10, the anniversary of the death of prize founder Alfred Nobel in 1896, together with the winners of five other Nobel prizes. The sixth one, the peace prize, is handed out in Oslo, Norway, on the same day.
On Monday, Americans William G. Kaelin Jr. and Gregg L. Semenza and Britain’s Peter J Ratcliffe won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, for discovering details of how the body’s cells sense and react to low oxygen levels, providing a foothold for developing new treatments for anaemia, cancer and other diseases.
Nobel, a Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite, decided the physics, chemistry, medicine and literature prizes should be awarded in Stockholm and the peace prize in Oslo.
The Nobel Prize for Chemistry will be announced Wednesday, two Literature Prizes will be awarded on Thursday, and the Peace Prize comes Friday. This year will see two Literature Prizes handed out because the one last year was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy.

334,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/facebook-says-removed-multiple-accounts-from-indonesia-uae-nigeria-and-egypt/,"Facebook Inc has announced it removed hundreds of pages, groups and accounts on its platforms for “coordinated inauthentic behaviour” linked to three operations in Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Nigeria.
The operation in Indonesia involved a network of over 100 fake accounts on Facebook and Instagram posting content in English and Indonesian either in support or criticising the West Papua independence movement, which is active in the country’s restive easternmost region of Papua.
“This was a network of pages designed to appear like local media organisations and advocacy organisations,” said David Agranovich, Facebook’s Global Lead for Threat Disruption.
He told Reuters that his team, which had been monitoring Indonesia in light of increasing tensions in Papua, had tracked the false accounts, which would disseminate content, buy ads, and drive people to other sites, to an Indonesian media firm called InsightID.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach the firm for comment.
There has been a spike in protests and unrest since late August in Papua, which suffered some of its worst bloodshed in decades in September, with 33 people killed and scores injured.
Researchers had independently warned in September that there had been a rise of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts on Papua, with some of the fake accounts posting pro-government content.
Agranovich said Facebook also removed fake accounts related to two other unconnected networks in the Middle East and Africa.
One, according to Facebook, was based out of Egypt, but targeted the rest of the region by posting content in support of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, as well as criticism of Qatar, Iran, Turkey and Yemen’s separatist movement.
The executive said this operation used fake accounts “to masquerade as local media organisations in a variety of those countries and amplify the content they were posting.”
According to Agranovich, Facebook found evidence some of the pages had been purchased, with regular changing ownerships, as well as deep links to Egyptian newspaper El Fagr, “which is known for its sensationalistic content.”
As a result of the investigation, Facebook has also removed El Fagr’s official media pages from its platforms, he said.
Reuters was not able to immediately contact El Fagr.
Facebook said the third network, which it tracked to three marketing firms in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Nigeria, involved fake accounts which spread on content on topics like UAE‘s activity in Yemen and the Iran nuclear deal.
The social media giant has recently been cracking down on such accounts after coming under fire in the last few years for its self-admitted sluggishness in developing tools to combat extremist content and propaganda operations.
Earlier this year, it removed accounts from Iraq, Ukraine, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Thailand, Honduras and Israel.

335,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/us-safety-agency-gathering-info-on-tesla-parking-lot-feature/,"WASHINGTON: The US government’s highway safety agency is gathering information on reports of malfunctions with a Tesla feature that lets drivers summon their cars in parking lots.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration stopped short of saying it had opened a formal investigation. But in a statement Thursday it said that it’s aware of the reports about “Smart Summon” and is in contact with the company.
“The agency will not hesitate to act if it finds evidence of a safety-related defect,” NHTSA said in a statement.
Last week, Tesla sent out an over-the-internet software update that lets some customers allow their car to navigate through a parking lot with no one at the wheel. The feature can only be used if a driver can see their vehicle, the company’s website says.
But after the update, videos and pictures surfaced on social media about problems. Also, a promotional video on Tesla’s website shows a car without a driver going the wrong way in a parking lot.
One owner said his car ran into the side of his garage while “Smart Summon” was working, while another showed his car narrowly missing a crash with crossing traffic. Another said his car was about to hit a golf cart before he was able to stop it.
Tesla’s website cautions that drivers who use “Smart Summon” are responsible for the car and must monitor it at all times. The cars can be stopped remotely.

WADA banned Russia from major sports events
Putin said decision violated Olympic charter
Russian leader: agency’s move smacked of politics
Ban was over Russian doping violations

PARIS: Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Moscow had grounds to appeal a decision by the World Anti-Doping Agency to bar Russia from major sporting events, a move he said violated the Olympic charter.
Russia was banned from the world’s top sporting events for four years earlier on Monday, including the next summer and winter Olympics and the 2022 soccer World Cup, for tampering with doping tests.
Putin, who was speaking in Paris after talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, said Russia would analyse a decision he said smacked of politics and was not in the interest of sport.

The doping agency’s executive committee acted after concluding that Moscow had planted fake evidence and deleted files linked to positive doping tests in laboratory data that could have helped identify drug cheats.
The decision was a huge blow to the pride of a nation that has traditionally been a powerhouse in many sports but whose reputation has been tarnished by a series of doping scandals.
Putin, at a news conference in the French presidency’s Elysee Palace, said the WADA conclusions contained no complaints directed at Russia’s national Olympic committee.
“And if there are no complaints against it, then the country should compete under the national flag. That’s written in the Olympic charter. That means that, in that aspect, the WADA decision violated the Olympic charter. We have all grounds to appeal,” Putin said.
“Any punishment should be individual, and should be linked to what has been done … by one person or another. A punishment cannot be collective, and apply to people who have nothing to do with certain violations,” he added.
“If someone takes such a decision about collective punishment, I think there is every grounds to suppose that the basis for such decisions is not a care about the purity of international sport, but political considerations which have nothing to do with the interest of sport or the Olympic movement,” Putin said.

Simmons and fellow opener Evin Lewis (40) put on 73 runs to give West Indies a strong start, both benefiting from India’s unusually sloppy catching at Thiruvananthapuram’s Greenfield International Stadium.

BIRMINGHAM: Leicester City set a club record of eight successive top flight wins after two goals from Jamie Vardy helped them to an impressive 4-1 Premier League victory at Aston Villa on Sunday.
Kelechi Iheanacho and Jonny Evans were also on target for Leicester, who served up a performance akin to those which produced a memorable title run in 2015-16 as they missed several chances to win by a bigger margin.
The result left the Foxes second in the standings on 38 points from 16 games, eight adrift of runaway leaders Liverpool and six ahead of third-placed champions Manchester City, while Villa slipped to 17th on 15 points.
Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers heaped praise on his players.
“I thought they were amazing, it is a historical day for the club and the performance warranted that,” he was quoted as saying by the BBC.
“We scored all types of goals today and kept going to the end and tried to keep scoring goals.”
The league’s top scorer Vardy fired Leicester ahead with his 15th goal of the season in the 20th minute when he shook off Ezri Konsa and slotted the ball in after rounding goalkeeper Tom Heaton with a sublime first touch.
Iheanacho made it 2-0 with a deft finish from a fizzing low cross by James Maddison before Jack Grealish pulled one back for Villa on the stroke of halftime, burying a powerful shot from 12 metres past goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.
Centre back Evans restored Leicester‘s two-goal advantage with a looping header from 10 metres shortly after the break, rising above his marker to meet a Maddison corner.
The effervescent Maddison, who tormented the home team’s defence all afternoon, shaved the post with a fine shot from the edge of the penalty area in the 67th minute as Leicester continued to dominate.
Vardy put the icing on the cake for the rampant visitors in the 76th minute after he raced clear of Matt Targett from the halfway line and drove the ball past Heaton into the bottom right corner.
Evans, who won three Premier League titles with Manchester United, was upbeat about Leicester‘s chances of finishing in the top four.
“We are up there and it shows we are playing well,” the 31-year-old Northern Ireland defender told Sky Sports.
“Our performance was good. It is nice people are talking about us, we’re enjoying it and there’s great spirit in the club.”

“I am extremely happy and feeling strange at the same time,” said Gaurika, the youngest athlete to take part in the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. “I was amazed when I won the first gold medal and the feeling is exactly the same today also,” said Gaurika. “I came to know about the record of three gold medals only after winning the third one today. And I am glad to achieve the feat as a woman athlete,” she added. “I would like to dedicate the first gold medal to the nation, the second one to my charity Maiti Nepal, and third to my grandfather (Lok Bhakta Rana) as a birthday gift,” said the champion, who will compete in the 200m individual medley event apart from two relays tomorrow. “I’ll be vying for another gold tomorrow.”
She is the third Nepali athlete to have won three gold medals, legendary marathon runner Baikuntha Manandhar and taekwondo player Ayasha Shakya being the other two. Manandhar won gold medals in the first three editions
of the SAF Games, while Shakya won two in the ongoing meet to add to her gold won in the 11th SA Games held in Dhaka in 2010. Singh is one short of all-time high behind taekwondo ace Deepak Bista, who won four golds in the eighth, ninth, 10th and 11th editions of the SA Games.
Gaurika also bagged silver in 50m backstroke event with a timing of 29.71 seconds. Indian swimmer Manna Rajiv Patel claimed gold in 28.94 seconds, while her teammate Ridhima Veerendra Kumar finished third in 30.46 seconds.

KATHMANDU: Nepal romped to 1-0 victory against Bangladesh and advanced into the final of men’s football during the13th South Asian Games held in Kathmandu, on Sunday.
Sunil Bal’s solitary strike in the 11th minute was enough from Nepal to see Bangladesh off in the crucial fixture at the full house Dashrath Stadium in the capital today.
Bal started the move and finished it smartly after stand-in skipper Sujal Shrestha supplied a weighted cut-back pass in the area. Playing in the presence of home supporters, Bal composed himself and sidefooted the ball into the far post and beyond the reach of diving Bangladeshi goalie.
Both the teams created numerous opportunities in the second half but to no avail.
During the closing stages, tempers flyered from both the side. Bangladesh searching for an equaliser suffered a blow after their talismanic skipper Jamal Phuyan was shown a red card for two bookable offences in the dying minutes of added minutes of the second half.
Earlier, Nepal had lost to Bangladesh in the final of the 8th edition of the SAFF games held in Kathmandu, in 1999.
With this hard-fought victory, Nepal will lock their horns against Bhutan in the title showdown at the Dasrath Stadium in Kathmandu, on Tuesday.

BERLIN: Borussia Moenchengladbach’s Ramy Bensebaini scored twice, including a stoppage-time penalty, for a 2-1 comeback win at home to champions Bayern Munich on Saturday which kept them top of the Bundesliga.
Algeria international Bensebaini converted from the spot after Javi Martinez was sent off for bringing down Marcus Thuram in the box.
Gladbach are now on 31 points with Bayern, who suffered their second consecutive league loss, dropping to seventh on 24.
RB Leipzig are second on 30, after beating Hoffenheim 3-1 with two goals from Timo Werner.
Borussia Dortmund’s Marco Reus and Jadon Sancho also scored two apiece in a 5-0 demolition of Fortuna Duesseldorf as their side moved up to third place on 26.
It was another wasteful performance from Bayern who should have scored several goals in a dominant first half through Thomas Mueller and top scorer Robert Lewandowski.
“It was like that last week against Leverkusen as well,” Bayern interim coach Hansi Flick told reporters.
“The team has the quality to score goals but at the moment it is not doing it. It is frustrating not to convert our chances.”
Gladbach keeper Yann Sommer denied Bayern twice more, including keeping the ball on the line with his fingertips, as the hosts were completely outclassed in the first half,
Bayern‘s Corentin Tolisso was taken off injured but his replacement Ivan Perisic delivered in the 49th, turning 180 degrees and firing home for the lead.
The hosts sprung to life after the goal and took control of the game, with Bensebaini levelling on the hour with a header after being given too much space in the box.
In an entertaining second half both teams looked for the winner but it was Gladbach who got it in stoppage time to continue their spectacular title run.
Argentine Lucas Alario scored both goals in Bayer Leverkusen’s 2-1 victory over Schalke 04 that lifted them into sixth on 25, level on points with the fourth-placed Royal Blues.

362,https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/liverpool-romping-clear-as-city-lose-at-united/,"
LONDON: Liverpool took a giant step towards their first title since 1990 on Saturday when their 3-0 win at Bournemouth combined with Manchester United’s 2-1 victory at Manchester City to leave the champions 14 points adrift of the Premier League leaders.
With second-placed Leicester, who play on Sunday, 11 points behind Liverpool, Juergen Klopp’s side are quoted as odds-on to finally secure the silverware that has eluded them for so long.
On a dramatic league day, individual honours went to Tottenham Hotspur’s Son Heung-min, who dribbled almost the length of the pitch to score in his side’s 5-0 rout of Burnley, and Everton caretaker manager Duncan Ferguson who inspired a 3-1 win over Chelsea in his first game in charge.
United, who beat Spurs in midweek, blew City away with a dazzling first-half performance at the Etihad, which was capped by a VAR-awarded Marcus Rashford penalty and a strike from Anthony Martial.
Although David De Gea had to be at his sharpest to keep City at bay after the interval, when City scored through Nicolas Otamendi, United were well worth their victory — Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s first as player or manager in a Manchester derby.
“We’ll remember this one, we look so dangerous when we get the ball and go forward against arguably the best team in the world,” said Solskjaer.
Guardiola, whose team have dominated the Premier League with back-to-back title wins, was reluctant to talk about their position in the league.
“It is not time to think about that. We have to think about what we have to do and think about the next game. Doesn’t matter if six, eight or 14 points, we have to continue. We are a fantastic team,” he said.
The only sour note for United, who are now fifth, came in the second half when midfielder Fred appeared to be hit by a missile thrown from the crowd as he went to take a corner in front of agitated City supporters. The Brazilian was not seriously hurt.
Fred was also the target of what appeared to a be a racist gesture from a fan in the crowd, captured by television images.
City said they were working with police to identify the fans involved in the incidents and said they had a “zero tolerance” approach to discrimination and “anyone found guilty of racial abuse will be banned from the club for life”.
Liverpool, who won 4-0 on their previous two visits to Bournemouth, again shuffled their side, making seven changes from the midweek Merseyside derby.
Two of Liverpool‘s lesser lights, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keita, responded with goals before Mohamed Salah completed the formalities in a win which saw Liverpool keep a clean sheet for the first time in 14 games.
An injury sustained by defender Dejan Lovren was the only blot on Liverpool‘s day but Klopp said he was hoping it was just a touch of cramp.
FERGUSON REWARDED FOR CHANGES
At Goodison Park, Everton looked nothing like the side who had subsided so abjectly at Liverpool, obviously re-energised by the fiery presence of Ferguson in place of Marco Silva in the dressing-room.
The Scot’s decision to switch formation was instantly rewarded with a goal for Richarlison before Dominic Calvert-Lewin added a double to send the crowd wild.
Although Ferguson said he had thoroughly enjoyed his first game in charge, he will not be asking for the job full-time.
“Honestly, I won’t be going asking for the job. I’m just here for Everton. It was an unbelievable experience; one I’ll never forget. We want the very best managers in the world at Everton Football Club. It’s one game. It’s one result.”
The win moved Everton away from the relegation zone, with most of their rivals playing on Sunday.
At the Tottenham Hotspur stadium, Spurs delivered exactly the sort of response to their defeat at Manchester United that manager Jose Mourinho wanted.
Although Harry Kane scored twice to make it eight goals in nine games against Burnley, Son took the headlines with a superb effort that started just outside his own area and saw the South Korean slalom through half the opposition before slotting home from inside the box.
Lucas Moura and Moussa Sissoko completed the scoring against a Burnley side who have conceded nine goals in four days.
“Sonny stole the show today,” said Kane, who is not often overshadowed in front of goal. “An unbelievable goal, a great counter attack. All he wants to do is work hard and play for the team. He has great quality and works hard for the team.”
Struggling Watford ended a string of three straight defeats against Crystal Palace in a scrappy game watched by their incoming manager Nigel Pearson, whose first game in charge could not be harder — a trip to Liverpool next Saturday.

PANCHTHAR: Timbung Lake, situated in between Panchthar and Taplejung districts, has grabbed the attention of travellers with it’s spectacular natural beauty, in recent times.
The lake is situated at 4,480 metres above the sea level.
A majority of domestic tourists as well as foreign tourists including from India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh come to visit the lake, especially from May to October.
Most of them come to enjoy sightseeing, view the scenic beauty of Himalayas and for religious purpose of late.
With the upgradation of trekking trails, other infrastructure and effective advertisement of the Lake, the number of tourists visiting the site has increased significantly in recent years, Khadak Bhandari, homestay entrepreneur, noted.
“We are trying our best to give optimum services to our guest. The lake is really like heaven,” Bhandari shared.
“The place is really amazing, beautiful and pristine. With better promotion, this place can be developed into a major touristic destination of eastern Nepal as it has lots of potentials,” Giriraj Gyawali, a traveller from Gulmi district, who made a maiden trip to Timbung Lake, shared.
“In comparison to earlier days, we receive at least 500 tourists during trekking season in recent days,” Bhim Bhandari, one of the homestay operator, said.

Buses from Tokyo’s Shinjuku district conveniently drop climbers off at a station located at the 2,300-metre (7,546 feet) point of the majestic mountain, the country’s tallest at 3,776 metres (12,388 feet). It’s not cheating. This is where most people start the long — and crowded — trek.





The Yoshida trail is the easiest and most popular among the routes to the top, with climbers wearing headlamps and carrying heavy packs spaced just feet apart on the rugged, rocky terrain. It takes an average hiker five to six hours to reach the summit. Most spend the night in simple mountain huts and start the final ascent in darkness. Crammed together in the sparse accommodations is part of the communal climbing experience.
Witnessing the sunrise from the summit of the nation’s symbolic mountain is hard to top. Watching it paint the sky deep orange is magnificent.
Climbing season runs from early July to early September, Mount Fuji will open to the public a couple of weeks before the Tokyo Summer Olympics opening ceremony on July 24.
After the descent, visit picturesque Lake Kawaguchi to photograph Mount Fuji from afar.

BANGKOK: Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, edged out Paris and London as the world’s most popular city to visit, according to a survey released on Wednesday, welcome news for Thailand after worries over a drop in foreign arrivals.
Bangkok was named the most-visited city for the fourth consecutive year, with about 22.8 million visitors reported in the annual rankings by MasterCard Inc.
Paris and London were ranked second and third, each with about 19.1 million arrivals, trailed by Dubai with 15.9 million.
Other Southeast Asian cities, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were fourth and fifth in the rankings, based on third-party research, proprietary analysis and public data across 200 destination cities.
New York, Istanbul, Tokyo and Antalya, Turkey, rounded out the top 10.
The number of international visitors across the 200 cities grew by 76% in the last 10 years.
Despite Bangkok’s longtime reign atop the list, the Thai tourism industry has faced headwinds, with arrivals dropping 1.03% year-on-year in May before recovering to grow 0.89% in June from a year earlier.
Tourism accounts for about 12% of Thailand’s economy.
However, weaker Chinese economic growth and a boat accident last year led to a drop off in Chinese arrivals in Thailand in the first half of this year.
The downturn in the number of visitors from China was partially offset by Indian arrivals.
Thailand expects to welcome 2 million Indian tourists in 2019, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, told Reuters, adding this was one year earlier than its target.
In August, the government extended a waiver of a 2,000 baht ($65) fee for visa-on-arrivals for tourists from 18 countries including those from China and India.
A growing middle class and increasing wealth in populations and the rise of low-cost airlines will make travel more accessible, Minor Hotels Chief Executive, Dilip Rajakrier, said in an email.
“Given only less than 10% of the China’s total population having passports today. The potential of the Chinese market will never fade,” he said.

371,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/thailand-extends-visa-fee-waivers-to-boost-tourism-as-growth-slows/,"BANGKOK: Thailand will extend until April next year a measure that waives fees for visas on arrival issued to tourists from 18 countries, as it looks to stimulate growth in tourism to spur a slowing economy, the prime minister said on Tuesday.
The waivers are part of a $10-billion stimulus package to boost growth, including a debt moratorium for farmers, loans for smaller businesses, and more money for low-income earners.
“The cabinet approved the extension of fee waivers until April 2020,” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters, adding that the scheme would cover Lunar New Year and the Thai new year, Songkran.
Foreign tourist receipts make up about 12% of Southeast Asia’s second largest economy, but arrivals increased just 0.89% in June, with visitors from China, the biggest source, declining 7.1% from a year earlier.
The fee of 2,000 baht ($65) is to be waived unil next year for travellers from 18 countries, including China and India.
But the cabinet rejected a proposal for visa-free entry for visitors from China and India, because of security concerns, government spokesman Narumon Pinyosinwat said.

372,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/not-just-bali-indonesia-hopes-to-develop-more-tourism-sites/,"YOGYAKARTA: Hundreds of tourists, many of them young Westerners, sat on grey stone steps atop the world’s largest Buddhist temple, occasionally checking cellphones or whispering to each other as they waited for daylight.
Sunrise wasn’t spectacular on that recent summer day. But even ordinary dawn at Borobudur Temple — nine stone tiers stacked like a wedding cake and adorned with hundreds of Buddha statues and relief panels — provided a memorable experience.

The 9th-century temple is in the centre of Indonesia’s Java island, a densely populated region with stunning vistas. Other highlights include the towering Hindu temple complex of Prambanan, like Borobudur a UNESCO World Heritage site, and Mount Merapi, the country’s most active volcano, whose lava-covered slopes are accessible by jeep.
While the two temples draw many visitors, other foreigners head to the relaxing beaches of Bali, just east of Java and by far the most popular tourist destination in a nation of thousands of islands and almost 270 million people. More than 6 million tourists visited Bali last year, or about 40 per cent of 15.8 million visitors to Indonesia overall, according to official figures.
Recently reelected President Joko Widodo wants to change this dynamic by pushing ahead with “10 new Balis,” an ambitious plan to boost tourism and diversify Southeast Asia’s largest economy.
Key to the plan is to upgrade provincial airports and improve access to outlying destinations, such as Lake Toba on Sumatra island, more than 1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from Jakarta, the capital. Yogyakarta, the provincial city from where visitors head to Borobudur and Prambanan, is getting a second airport, expected to be fully operational later this year.
Widodo has been promoting his plan in meetings with foreign leaders and in recent interviews, including with The Associated Press, in hopes of encouraging foreign investment. The president of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation told the AP in late July that as part of his push, he would like to see more business ties with the Middle East.
“For investment and tourism, we would like to invite investors from the Middle East as much as possible because … we have many tourism locations in Indonesia, not only one or two or four, but many,” said Widodo. He did not give specifics.
Muslim tourists, including from the Middle East, might also be an easier fit for some of the more conservative areas earmarked for tourism development. Tourism officials have played down the possibility of cultural friction that might accompany the influx of more non-Muslim visitors, arguing that Indonesia’s brand of tolerant Islam can accommodate everyone.
“Maybe there are some particular locations that are very strict (religiously),” said Hiramsyah Thaib, who heads the “10 New Balis” initiative. “We believe we won’t have any problems. Sometimes we have problems in the media, but not in reality.”
Yet Islamic hard-liners have become more assertive in recent years, potentially spooking investors by undermining Indonesia’s image as a moderate nation. Thaib said he believes investor confidence rose “significantly” after Widodo defeated former special forces general Prabowo Subianto in April’s presidential election. Subianto had been backed by Muslim groups favouring Shariah law.
The tourism plan remains key to Widodo’s final five-year term, though at least one target — 20 million visitors this year — appears to have been too ambitious. The 2019 visitor tally is expected to be 18 million, based on current growth figures, said Thaib.
Still, the Indonesian tourism sector grew by 7.8 per cent in 2018, or twice the global average, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
One of the 10 sites earmarked for development is the Borobudur Temple area and nearby Yogyakarta, a city of several hundred thousand people that are embedded in a large metro area. The city is a centre of Javanese culture and a seat of royal dynasties going back centuries.
In 2017, former President Barack Obama and his family visited the city, where his late mother, Ann Dunham, spent years doing anthropological research. Obama, who lived in Indonesia as a child, toured Borobudur and Prambanan during the nostalgic trip.
But while the Obamas got around with relative ease, including private jet travel, ordinary visitors struggle with congested streets packed with motorbikes weaving in and out of slow-moving traffic.
Travellers hoping to be in place at Borobudur just before sunrise need at least 90 minutes to get there from Yogyakarta, a journey of 40 kilometres (24 miles). A 230-kilometre (140-mile) round trip to the Dieng highlands, with terraced fields, small temples and a colourful volcanic lake, requires a full day of travel, some of it on bumpy back roads.
Anton McLaughlin, a 55-year-old visitor from York, England, said he was astounded by the number of motorbikes in the streets. Speaking during a jeep tour of the slopes of Mount Merapi, he said he’s become more aware of the natural disasters Indonesians endure regularly. Indonesia straddles the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Merapi’s last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people, and the ruins of one destroyed hamlet were part of the tour.
“People just seem to crack on with life,” McLaughlin said.
Just a day after his tour, the volcano shot out hot clouds and lava that flowed 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) down its slopes. No casualties or damage were reported.
Jan Tenbrinke, 37, from Zwolle in the Netherlands, said Bali is the next stop for his family of four, but that he hoped to get a better sense of Indonesian culture in Yogyakarta.
In the city, tourists can visit workshops for Batik textiles, silver jewellery and Kopi Luwak — coffee made from partially digested coffee cherries that were eaten and defecated by wild tree cats, or civets. Billed as the “world’s most expensive coffee,” Kopi Luwak became known to a wider audience in the 2007 Jack Nicholson-Morgan Freeman movie “The Bucket List.”
Local museums, including two royal palaces and a former Dutch fort, pose a challenge for foreign visitors eager to learn more about local history and culture because they mostly lack easily accessible explanations in English.
Thaib, the tourism official, acknowledged that there is room for improvement. He said Indonesia is determined to catch up to other Asian nations, including Thailand, which he said began developing their tourism industries much sooner.
“There is still a lot of work,” he said of his nation’s efforts. “We believe we are on the right track.”

HIKKADUWA: Sipping fresh coconut water while sunbathing on deserted Hikkaduwa beach, Alexi Konchayenko, a sports trainer from Ukraine, struck a stoical note.
Bomb blasts can happen “anywhere, anytime,” he said, adding that he was not afraid. “Sri Lanka is an amazing country. This is my first visit and I will tell my friends also to come.”
His is a lone voice — and a lone presence. Sri Lanka was the Lonely Planet guide’s top travel destination for 2019, but since the Easter Sunday attacks on churches and luxury hotels, foreign tourists have fled.
Many of those booked to come in the next few months have cancelled. Hotel occupancy across the island has plummeted by 85% to 90%. The tropical beaches, restaurants and shops are empty.
The coordinated suicide bombings on April 21 not only destroyed lives but also wiped out the livelihoods of Sri Lankans who depend on tourism.
More than 250 people, including 45 foreigners mainly from China, India, the US and the UK, died in the Islamic State group-claimed blasts.
Tourists normally come to Hikkaduwa, in the southwest, for the strong waves that are perfect for surfing and sparkling clear waters made for snorkelling. Today, of the 27 hotels, very few are open. Most, along with the eateries that line the 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of palm-fringed beach, are closed.
Among the few hotels still open is Hikkaduwa Beach Hotel. On April 21, all 50 rooms were occupied; today, only a handful. “It’s a real disaster. We don’t know what to do right now,” said Sanjeewani Yogarajah, an executive with the hotel. She said the attack has cost the hotel 5.5 million Sri Lankan rupees ($31,000), forcing the hotel’s management to send half the staff home.
Some tourism officials say the damage to the industry after the bombings is worse than during the 26-year civil war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the government which ended a decade ago. At least then, the violence was mostly contained to the north of Sri Lanka, they said. This time, no part of the island has remained untouched by the blasts.
Lankesha Ponnamperuma, general manager of hotel chain Hikka Tranz, is one of the luckier ones. While most hotels report wholesale cancellations, he is surviving thanks to business from local residents. Last Friday, two-thirds of the 150 rooms were booked, mostly by domestic tourists.
“I haven’t sacked anyone yet. Instead, we are training our people to adjust their expenditure and helping them restructure their bank loans,” Ponnamperuma said.
The president of Sri Lanka’s Hotels Association, Sanath Ukwatta, said hotels have offered 30-50% discounts to entice local residents.
Such a strategy won’t solve the problem, he said, but will “help at least to keep the hotels going.”
The manager of a clothing shop said the owner had shut the group’s other two shops and the factory too. “Business collapsed after April 21,” said Kumari, who declined to give her surname.
According to government figures, there has been an 80% drop in arrivals since the attack. Tourism accounts for 4.9% of Sri Lanka’s GDP. Last year, 2.3 million tourists visited the island, generating $4.4 billion in revenues, a nearly 12% jump from 2017. Around half a million Sri Lankans directly depend on tourism while 2 million depend on it indirectly.
One of them is Mohomed Musflick, the owner of a souvenir shop in Galle which is full of wood carvings, local paintings and postcards. “I have not sold one item. There are no tourists and we are in a huge crisis,” he said.
While life is gradually returning to normal on the island with offices and schools re-opening, the tourism industry is in a sombre mood over the slump in foreign tourists. Tour operators from Russia, Norway and Britain have cancelled bookings going right up to April 2020.
A travel ban issued by nearly a dozen countries is the greatest cause for concern. “The ban is our main worry. Until it is removed or softened, we can’t start our marketing to attract tourists. If it is lifted soon, we are hopeful we can bounce back this year or otherwise definitely next year for sure,” said Yogarajah.
In the meantime, Sri Lanka’s government should target “people and countries resilient to this kind of attacks and situations, such as Russia, Israel and India,” said Anusha Frydman, managing director of the Lavanga Resort and Spa.
The industry is clear about what else it wants from the authorities: Ensure that stringent security measures are in place to reassure potential visitors; persuade politicians to put their differences aside and adopt a bipartisan approach on national security; and work fast to get the travel ban lifted.
To help the industry cope, the government has put together a relief package comprising easy loans at special rates and reduced taxes. The government also plans to formulate a $100 million insurance fund for compensation to any tourist injured or killed while visiting the island.
“In the past we have had many serious crises and we have recovered. I am quite positive we can do it again,” said Jan van Twest, general manager of the Fortress Resort and Spa near Galle, where 750 room nights have been cancelled from May to October.
“But we need to recover, recover very fast,” he said.

Whenever I told someone I was planning to climb to Mount Everest Base Camp this spring, I received the same shocked and wide-eyed response: “Be careful!” While that’s good advice for any adventure, it was difficult to convince friends and family that this trip would not at all be the same thing as actually climbing Mount Everest.
Instead, the Everest Base Camp Trek provides an opportunity for regular hikers like me to tackle a feasible portion of one of the most iconic climbs in the world.
Base Camp is located at 17,600 feet, well below the peak of Everest, which is 29,000 feet. Base Camp is where those planning to summit spend weeks acclimatising and preparing for their journey. It is also the furthest you can go using only your legs before other equipment like ropes and ice picks get involved.
Our eight-day journey to Base Camp began at 9,300 feet, in the small Nepalese mountain town of Lukla. There are no roads to Lukla. It is accessible only by a 30-minute plane ride from Kathmandu. When we landed, I was shocked to find the area crowded and bustling, filled with locals selling trinkets and outdoor gear, and what felt like hundreds of trekkers preparing for their climbs.
From Lukla, we wound our way up muddy paths and across dangling suspension bridges, stepping aside for herds of yak and dzo (yak/cattle hybrids) as we walked further and further into the most remote area in which I have ever hiked.
Yet, it didn’t feel that way. Small towns continued to greet us all the way up. There were lodges to stay in. There were restaurants and bars. I have photos at the world’s highest Irish pub and the world’s highest bakery. In one of the larger towns, Namche Bazaar, at about 11,200 feet, there was even a North Face store. In these towns, dozens of miles from the nearest road, all food and supplies are brought in by helicopter, porter or animal.
In addition to breathtaking, 360-degree views of the Himalayas, elaborate Buddhist monuments lie along the entire route. Every day along the trail we saw massive, intricately painted boulders and colourful stupas (structures meant to bring good karma) wrapped in multicoloured prayer flags. At one point, we even toured a large, fully functioning monastery.
The terrain itself is not as difficult as you’d expect. Anyone in good physical shape could do it, and I have done many other hikes that I found more challenging. We still climbed several thousand feet per day, but the inclines were relatively gradual. This trek, instead, should be known for its panoramic views and the unique experience of hiking through these remote mountain towns.
Of course, the trip is not without risks, but they lie in unexpected places. The flights to and from Lukla are the most dangerous part of the journey. The Lukla airport has long been considered one of the most dangerous airports in the world — and in fact, a fatal crash occurred while we were there. I tried to push the knowledge of the airport’s dangers to the furthest recesses of my mind as I boarded a tiny propeller plane bound for that very place.
The plane ride is beautiful, with mountains on all sides, but the landing is enough to put even the fiercest adventurer on edge. A standard runway is between 6,000-8,000 feet long; Lukla’s is only 1,700 feet long. It’s sloped upward to help slow the plane before it hits the solid rock wall waiting at the end of it. At the other end is a 2,000-foot drop. After landing safely, we were mesmerised watching the planes taking off for Kathmandu literally fly off the edge of a cliff.
Altitude sickness is also a concern, though if you work with an experienced guiding company as we did, they will ensure you climb up slowly to acclimatise. We had two layover days and hiked a far shorter distance each day than our bodies were capable of going. This itinerary helped us grow accustomed to the air as it grew thinner.
Hiking up slowly didn’t feel like a burden, though, as it allowed extra time to take in those jaw-dropping views. The higher I climbed, the more I felt like I could reach out and touch the shimmering, snow-capped peaks. The further we progressed, the more the mountains seemed to bend toward us like we were inside of a snow globe.
At several points, we caught sight of Everest’s majestic peak peering out from behind its neighbours. Most of Everest lies in Tibet, but the peak is in Nepal. As such, the trek to Base Camp does not actually take place on Mount Everest, but inside Sagarmatha National Park — Sagarmatha being the Nepalese name for Everest.
Each day, as we made it a little higher, the air became a little thinner and our breath a little shorter. By day eight, the time between each step I took had grown significantly. I was breathing hard. My feet were dragging and my head pounding. I trudged slowly upward, but upward nonetheless, knowing the goal was within reach.
By mid-afternoon, we hiked across the final ridge and Base Camp came into view. We had made it to the gateway to the top of the world.
Base Camp rests on a massive glacier. I high-fived my group and took in the sight of dozens of yellow tents pitched across the ice, tents belonging to those preparing for their ascent. According to my trekking guide, the glacial terrain changes so rapidly that the expeditioners have to move their tents every two weeks.
We took pictures beside the sign declaring we were there and feasted on dark chocolate almond bark to celebrate. As the afternoon clouds rolled in, we lay back and watched the mountains disappear above our heads. The cheers and squeals of more trekkers arriving filled the air as it began to snow.
It may not have been the top, but it was nonetheless a spot where most people on the planet will never set foot. I feel so lucky to have stood in that very special place, and, as I always do at the end of a hike, I feel so strong knowing it was my own two feet that got me there.

AMSTERDAM: The city of Amsterdam’s latest attempt to rein in the nuisance of over-tourism by banning guided tours of the red light district has run into opposition from some of the people it is intended to protect: sex workers.
The Dutch capital plans to ban such tours, saying they are disrespectful and contribute to congestion in the narrow, canal-side streets where scantily-clad sex workers sit behind windows to attract customers.
The first step in the new policy was taken Monday night in the red light district, with tours banned from 7 p.m.
On a recent Friday night, the problem was clear to see: Tourists bathed in a red glow emanating from the windows and peep shows’ neon lights were packed shoulder to shoulder as they shuffled through the alleys.
But sex workers’ union Proud questions whether banning tours will reduce tourist numbers and argues that guides educate visitors and encourage them to behave more respectfully toward the women.
“It could also be that now there are no guides that people just wander into the area themselves and gawk at the women behind the window and take photos because there is no one anymore to inform them how to behave or what the rules of the game are in this area,” said a sex worker who goes by the name of Velvet and is the advocacy coordinator for Proud. Velvet declined to give her real name, saying that because of the stigma attached to sex work, most sex workers use a working name or pseudonym to protect their privacy and safety.
Amsterdam’s Prostitution Information Center, which is housed in the same building as Proud, offers its own red light district tours.
The total ban on guided tours, which is planned to come into full force on Jan. 1, is another step in the city’s campaign to reduce the problems associated with over-tourism and part of a broader package of measures reining in tours in the city.
Bobien van Aalst of the Dutch tour guide association Guidor slammed the ban on tours, not just to the red light district but to other historic parts of the city. She said it means guides won’t be able to explain to tourists where Rembrandt van Rijn painted one of his first famous works or where the painter’s wife is buried.
“I mean it’s like in Paris if you’re forbidding (tours) to go to the Arc de Triomphe or the Eiffel Tower,” she said.
City Hall says that more than 1,000 tour groups per week now operate around the Old Church Square in the heart of the red light district.
“Yeah, there’s really over-tourism there — too crowded. I mean there were evenings where … residents basically couldn’t leave their homes anymore because the alleys were blocked,” the city’s deputy mayor, Udo Kock, told The Associated Press.
People who work in Amsterdam’s sex industry question whether there are more tourists, or whether similar numbers are squeezing into a red light district that has shrunk in recent years as hundreds of the sex workers’ windows have been shuttered in an attempt to diversify the narrow streets.
Kock acknowledges that not everybody is happy, but says many others are pleased that the city is tackling the tours.
The red light district is a tourist magnet, especially after dark, with crowds of people waiting to get into sex shows and visiting the Red Light Secrets Museum of Prostitution, where you can experience the windows from a sex worker’s perspective by sitting on a stool in front of a “window” onto which images are projected of men walking past and peering in.
The museum’s manager, Natascha Flipsen, agrees that guided tours help educate the visitors not just about the history of the centuries-old red light district, but also about how to treat the women who work there with respect.
And she says that tourism is good for the business.
For tourists, “this is like the once in a lifetime experience, so they visit the sex work as well of course,” Flipsen said.

A lighting strike is pictured from an aircraft at an area in Singapore. Photo: Skanda Gautam/THT
So, my brother, who lives in the US, was getting married. Arrange a visa, head to the States to attend the wedding — that’s a lot of work. I thought I’d just wish him from here. A few days later, a Viber group was created including me and other children from my maternal family, and all of my mother’s sisters — eight in total. Now the wedding would take place in Bali, Indonesia. Wow a ‘Destination Wedding’!
More excited than ever, I agreed that I was going. So I started saving, and yes the time finally came.
I took leave from office for 10 days, booked the tickets for my mother and me, and started packing. When I left my house and reached the airport, it didn’t feel like I was actually going to Bali, but when I sat on the plane, I realised that my journey had begun. The flight, which was pretty chilled with a couple of beers, was of around four hours to Singapore, our transit point.
Then through tough Singapore security, helped by Starbucks coffee and a coconut drink, we were finally on our way to Bali.
So Bali. What can I say? The first thing that crossed my mind is ‘hot and sweaty’. As we got the hang of the weather, we found our guide, and an hour’s drive to the villa.





The sight along the way was awesome — statues of Hindu deities were around every street and corner. And you could see beautiful hand-carved statues of Ganesha and other deities in the shops, a breathtaking scene, their faith in religion, how they worship the gods.
I later found out that they are so religious that all of Bali was closed for two days for New Year’s prayers a day before we arrived. They meditate and pray at temples and their homes.
The villa was like a dream house with a swimming pool. The first thing I did was leave my baggage and go to a local pub for some chilled beers. The most popular and loved beer was Bintang, which cost 25,000 rupiah a bottle — shocking at first, but I later realised it’s around Rs 200.
People from all over the world, especially Australians come here to surf.
The weather is humid, so you sweat like crazy. It is constant summer with no winter, and even the metrology can’t predict rainfall. So it’s mandatory to spend your day in the pool with yes, chilled beer.
The local food was amazing, and hospitality commendable. The beautiful sunset by the ocean added to our first few days making everything surreal.
We also went for Luwak coffee tasting where they give you different drinks of flavoured tea and coffee, which was all free until you wished to drink the world’s most expensive coffee — Luwak animal poop coffee. The process to extract the poop was amazing using traditional hand method of collection to packing. A small cup cost us around 350,000 million Indonesian rupiah, and to buy a small pack I spent nearly 750,000 million rupiah, a gift for my dad that equals around $80. Crazy right? And it was really strong too.
The monkey temple was cool, more like a jungle with amazing sculptures of deities and filled with monkeys, better looking than the ones from Nepal. More mature looking I must say.
Then we visited the Saroswati Temple famous for its lotus blooms. Most people come for wedding photo shoots.
I also pampered myself to a fish spa for my feet. So ticklish!
Then the big day arrived — everything had to be Nepali style, the groom in a car to the wedding temple to the attire to the wedding dance janti. People were amazed, a few even made attempts to film the wedding.
About 50 guests attended the wedding.
The temple where the wedding was held was a massive one dedicated to Lord Shiva. The rituals were in Sanskrit language and I couldn’t understand any of it! The ritual was short as compared to Nepal, the ceremony concluded in just around two hours.
My brother had hired an amazing wedding planner. The ceremony was for two days — mehendi night at our new villa by the beach with black sand, a Jacuzzi and a swimming pool and breathtaking view of the surfers. The whole night was a blast with no sleep where my phone dived into the pool and died. Sad story but …
The next day was the wedding — early morning ceremony by the ocean and janti in 1940s classic vehicle headed towards the temple where the ceremony took place. The reception took place in the evening where a Balinese fire dancer showcased all kinds of acts and fire tricks. The decoration was beautiful with all the lights reflected by the pool of our villa.
We had heard of the popular Bali swing, so the last day we spent seeing that and other sites and shopping places.
Though we had a few mishaps  — a few had their luggage arriving a day late, one bashed his head swimming at 3:00 am, one broke his leg, my aunt lost $1,200, and I dropped my phone in the pool, it was one heck of a week.
As I write this story, I still feel the wind, the ocean, my family’s laughter and the closeness we felt coming together from different parts of the world for a week, leaving our hectic lives behind to enjoy and be together in a beautiful new place and for such an auspicious occasion. It was an experience of a life time.

CYRENE, LIBYA: Graffiti covers the walls of a Greek amphitheatre in Cyrene, an ancient ruined city in eastern Libya now struggling with neglect, vandals and illegal confiscation of land by locals.
The deserted souvenir shops and cafes on the mountainous road leading to the 2,600-year-old site are the only reminders that this used to be a major tourist destination.
Looting has hit Libya’s archaeological sites since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 when the country descended into turmoil with rival administrations competing for control.
Cyrene is one of five of UNESCO’s World Heritage sites in the North African country listed for their outstanding value. Others include the ruins of the Roman city of Leptis Magna, and Sabratha, both in western Libya.
Apart from Cyrene, some 200 km (124 miles) east of Benghazi, the east of the country has the Apollonia site just 20 km away.
With tourists gone and the antiquities department complaining about budget shortages, vandals have smeared graffiti on columns and looted artefacts.
Some treasures such as heads or entire torsos of statues listed in guidebooks issued in 2011 are no longer there.
“Many artefacts have been smuggled abroad,” said Ahmad Hussein, the head of the antiquities department of a parallel administration in charge of eastern Libya.
Unable to prevent theft, his department has been registering artefacts, a process which has helped to recover some in Europe, he said.
There was better site protection before 2011, but excavation at the site, in fact, dates back to Italian rule — the colonialists’ equipment can still be seen. The last Italians left the east in 1943 following their military defeat when the region came under British administration.
“There has been a lot of destruction in recent years,” said Ismail Miftah, a farmer living next to Cyrene. “Ordinary people don’t appreciate the ancient heritage.”

KATHMANDU: Four Sherpa climbers who got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Mt Makaulu Base Camp in two-metre deep snow in Sankhuwasabha for over a week shared that the high route of the Great Himalaya Trail witnessed an unusual snowfall in this winter season.
Four climbers – Pemba Jangbu Sherps, Darinji Sherpa, Pemba Rinji Sherpa and Pasang Gelu Sherpa were rescued by a Kailash Air helicopter on Monday as they ran out of food in the mountain area while embarking on a trek namely “German Nepal Friendship: The Great Himalaya Trail in Winter”.
It was really an unusual snowfall in the region, one of the team leaders Pemba Jangbu shared.
“We had to to turn around due to heavy snow in the Barun-Valley in Sankhuwasabha this season,” he said, recounting that as this is was a friendship project between Nepal and Germany the crew continued to Barun Dobhan trying to reach the high passes – Sherpani Col 6,110m, West Col 6,100m and Amphu Labtsa 5,700m – to cross into Khumbu.
“This is not only the story of the first ever attempt of the GHT High Route in winter but a story about German-Nepali friendship,” German Geographer Hannes Kuenkel, who is also a leader of the team, added.
This year the crew regrouped and was joined by seven experienced Sherpa – Darinji, Pemba Rinji, Pasang Gelu, Dafuri, Pasang Dawa, Phurba Sonam, Pasang Tendi – from Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Municipality-1, Solokhumbu, German photographer Martin Poetter and Austrian videographer Julia Brunner.
As they started their trek from Olongchun Gola where they had to break up last time and then crossed the snowy Lumbha Samba Pass (5,175m), the team reached Arun Valley on January 11.
“As all routes up to Makulu Base Camp were very difficult we tried the High Route above Hongon up to Malun Pokhari at 4,000m and we had experienced heavy snowfall and up to two feet high snow which made it impossible to hike with heavy loads,”  Kuenkel said.
As the weather was very unpredictable and the route not marked or built the team decided to take their only chance for the High Route by splitting the group in Gadhi on January 19 and sending the four strongest Sherpas led by Pemba Jangbu with only minimum equipment and light packs via Keke La pass (4,100m) towards the high passes while the others returned to Tumlingtar and flew via Kathmandu to Namche to meet up with the crew again, according to him.
The plan was that the Germans met the Sherpa again in Khumbu and together finished the Eastern part of the GHT via the icy Trashi Labtsa Pass (5,777m).
“Unfortunately the weather became worse and the Sherpa team got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Makaulu Base Camp in up to two-metre deep snow and the crew experienced 120 hours of continuous snowfall between January 22 (1pm) and January 28 (1am).”
On January 24, the snowfall stopped for 13 hours but the helicopter could not start from Kathmandu due to bad weather there. Pemba Jangbu who led over 26 expeditions told that he never experienced this kind of snowfall before. “On 28th January, a helicopter rescue was successful. It was just in time as the crew run out of gas and food.”
This winter the extraordinarily heavy snowfall did not allow the team to continue. So the team returned to Kathmandu were they stay together as friends and already prepare plans for a next attempt, according to Kuenkel, who visited Nepal for 15 times.
The two expedition leaders Pemba Jangbu and Kuenkel mentioned that they continued this project for three reasons: to promote trekking in Nepal, make people sensitive for the consequences of global warming and demonstrating how strong and powerful the international friendship can be.
According to team members, Pemba Jangbu, also owner of IAM Trekking & Expeditions and the German Geographer Hannes met during an Everest North Side Expedition which was shattered by the big earthquake in 2015.
In January 2017 they started the first attempt of the GHT High Route in winter. As the eastern part of Nepal has the highest mountains and passes they decided to take that challenge first and go from East to West starting in Taplejung.
They went up to Pangpema BC of Kantschendzonga, crossing the Nango La (4700m) to Olangchung Gola. That year the German became heavily sick in Olangchung Gola and had to give up early.

BANGKOK: Thailand approved marijuana for medical use and research on Tuesday, the first legalisation of the drug in a region with some of the world’s strictest drug laws.
The junta-appointed parliament in Thailand, a country which until the 1930s had a tradition of using marijuana to relieve pain and fatigue, voted to amend the Narcotic Act of 1979 in an extra parliamentary session handling a rush of bills before the New Year’s holidays.
“This is a New Year’s gift from the National Legislative Assembly to the government and the Thai people,” said Somchai Sawangkarn, chairman of the drafting committee, in a televised parliamentary session.
While countries from Colombia to Canada have legalised marijuana for medical or even recreational use, the drug remains illegal and taboo across much of Southeast Asia, which has some of the world’s harshest punishments for drug law violations.
Marijuana traffickers can be subject to the death penalty in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.
But in Thailand, the main controversy with legalisation involved patent requests by foreign firms that could allow them to dominate the market, making it harder for Thai patients to access medicines and for Thai researchers to access marijuana extracts.
“We’re going to demand that the government revoke all these requests before the law takes effect,” said Panthep Puapongpan, Dean of the Rangsit Institute of Integrative Medicine and Anti-Aging.
Some Thai advocates hope that Tuesday’s approval will pave the way for legalisation for recreational use.
“This is the first baby step forward,” said Chokwan Chopaka, an activist with Highland Network, a cannabis legalisation advocacy group in Thailand.

BERLIN: More than 6 million visitors, 7.5 million liters of beer, 124 rotisserie oxen and Bill Clinton in lederhosen; another Oktoberfest in Munich has come and gone.
Festival organizers say good fall weather helped attract 100,000 more people to the annual event than last year; in all, 6.3 million from about 70 countries. That’s despite this year’s Oktoberfest running only 16 days — two fewer than in 2017.
Former US President Clinton and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showed up Friday night — he dressed in traditional Bavarian garb and she in a trademark pantsuit.
Security guards confiscated 101,000 liter-size beer mugs from sticky-fingered guests seeking souvenirs. Munich authorities cleaned up 95 tons of garbage during the festival that ended Sunday.

MEDORA: For travelers looking to visit all 50 states, North Dakota is often one of the last to be checked off. It’s not exactly on the way to anywhere else, and flying there is expensive.
It ended up being 49th on my 50-state quest (sorry, Idaho!). Part of the challenge was deciding what to do there and how to get there. I had to choose between visiting Fargo in eastern North Dakota (and the name of one of my favorite movies) or Theodore Roosevelt National Park in the west.
It’s 330 miles (530 kilometers) between them, and I didn’t have time for both on a week-long road trip that also included Montana’s Glacier National Park and Idaho’s Craters of the Moon.
In the end, Roosevelt Park won out. Photos of its badlands and prairies enchanted me, and the story of Teddy Roosevelt’s sojourn there following the deaths of his wife and mother on the same day intrigued me.
What was it about this place that allowed this future president to grieve and recover — while at the same time inspiring him to become one of America’s most influential conservationists? I needed to see it for myself.
GETTING THERE
My husband and I flew to Denver — by air from New York, the cheapest jumping-off point — and rented a car (unlimited mileage, of course). We then drove 600 miles (965 kilometers) north through Wyoming and South Dakota to the tiny North Dakota town of Medora (population 132), at the entrance to the park’s South Unit.
Fortunately, those 600 miles were easily done in a day, thanks to speed limits of 75 and 80 mph (120-128 kph) in many spots, and little traffic outside Colorado. Still, it felt like we were heading to a pretty remote place, and I wondered if the park would hold its own against national parks I’d visited in Alaska, Hawaii and the Southwest, not to mention Yellowstone and Yosemite.
About 700,000 people visit Roosevelt Park yearly, compared to the more than 3 million annual visitors at places like Montana’s Glacier Park.
THE LOOP AND WILDLIFE
Teddy Roosevelt Park is open 24 hours daily. We arrived at 7:30 a.m. one day at the tail end of last summer. Map in hand, we drove the 36-mile (58-kilometer) scenic loop around the park’s South Unit, stopping at many of the nearly 20 points of interest along the way.
Within minutes, we came upon a prairie dog town. Dozens of the tiny creatures scampered back and forth, popping in and out of little holes amid scrubby grasses. We’d see three more prairie dog towns before we completed the loop, along with wild horses grazing on a hill by the roadside and in another spot, a herd of bison.
The wildlife encounters were thrilling and unexpected surprises.
THE LANDSCAPE
The landscape was thrilling too. The scent of sage perfumed the air, and bursts of red foliage punctuated the gray-green grasslands. Stripes of peach, cream and mud-brown earth and stone lined the curving banks of the Little Missouri River.
Framing it all were the famous badlands stretching to the horizon: flat-topped stone formations with striated slopes in tawny yellows and russet reds, dotted with bright green trees and patches of grass. They looked like the crusty paws of some massive alien creature on the verge of rising up.
We did most of the hikes along the loop drive, some just a few minutes’ walk to an overlook, others 20 to 40 minutes along hilly trails covering a mile or more. At every stop, we were awed by the scenery, from the astonishing palette of earthy hues to the stone shapes etching land and sky.
ROOSEVELT’S STORY
An exhibit at the visitor center tells Roosevelt’s story. On his first visit in 1883, he hunted bison and invested in a ranch near Medora. He’d been a state assemblyman in his native New York, but after his mother and wife both died on Feb. 14, 1884, he left politics and returned to the badlands to mourn his losses.
He lived in a small ponderosa pine cabin now located just steps from the visitor center. It’s furnished with period pieces and some of his belongings, including his traveling trunk, a replica of his writing desk and a rocking chair.
Roosevelt lived the cowboy life, spending days riding and herding in what was considered America’s last frontier. His experiences there were formative: He lost more than $24,000 when blizzards decimated the cattle he’d invested in. He witnessed the environmental damage done by overgrazing. And he realized that the bison, who once roamed the plains in the millions, had dwindled to the hundreds.
Roosevelt wrote three books inspired by his Western sojourn. He eventually returned to politics, serving as New York governor and from 1901-1909, as US president. His accomplishments included the conservation of 230 million acres of land, a legacy that led to the creation of the National Park Service in 1916.
For me, Roosevelt Park ranks among the most interesting and beautiful I’ve seen. I wish I hadn’t waited so long to visit, and I hope someday to go back and absorb more of the place that Roosevelt called “a land of vast silent spaces — a place of grim beauty.”

DENPASAR, INDONESIA: The Indonesian tourist island of Bali closed its international airport Friday, stranding thousands of travelers, as the Mount Agung volcano gushed a 2,500-meter (8,200-feet) column of ash and smoke.
The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said nearly 450 flights were canceled, affecting some 75,000 people.
The regional Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Darwin, Australia, said winds would carry the ash southwest toward Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island. Volcanic ash is a potentially deadly threat to aircraft that can cause engines to “flame out.”
The volcano began belching ash and smoke on Thursday and several airlines canceled inbound and outbound flights scheduled for the evening.
“We hadn’t a place to stay for the night so we had to find something else, just took a taxi and stayed at a random hostel,” said a stranded German backpacker who identified herself as Louisa. “We hoped that we could leave this morning, but the airport is closed,” she said.
Two small airports, at Banyuwangi and Jember in eastern Java, also closed because of the ash threat.
Agung’s alert level has not been raised and an exclusion zone around the crater remains at 4 kilometers (2.5 miles).
The disaster agency said the closure of Bali’s airport is in effect until 7 p.m. It said the situation will be reviewed at midday.
Australia’s national airline Qantas said in a statement that it’s “currently not safe” to operate Bali flights.
It said it was monitoring advice from the ash advisory center and its own pilots and meteorologists would decide when flights can resume.
The volcano, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) northeast of Bali’s tourist hotspot of Kuta, last had a major eruption in 1963, killing about 1,100 people.
It had a dramatic increase in activity last year, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, but had quietened by early this year. Authorities lowered its alert status from the highest level in February.
Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Government seismologists monitor more than 120 active volcanoes.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: Once a pristine Thai paradise, the secluded bay made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie “The Beach” has been exhausted by mass tourism. Now it’s getting a break.
After Friday, the daily influx of dozens of boats and thousands of visitors unsuccessfully scrambling for an unspoiled view of Maya Bay’s emerald waters and glistening white sand will end. The attraction is being closed for four months to give its coral reefs and sea life a chance to recover.
Thailand has promoted unfettered tourism for decades and the onslaught on Maya Bay, which is on Phi Phi Leh Island in the Andaman Sea, has only picked up pace in recent years. Authorities now say they are striving to balance profit and conservation and the closure will happen every year.
It is part of a rethink happening globally about unrestricted tourism that brings in big dollars but damages historic sites, harms the environment and often alienates locals.
Last month, the Philippines began a six-month closure of popular Boracay Island, whose waters President Rodrigo Duterte described as a “cesspool.” Venice, the famed Italian lagoon city that lives off tourism, installed gates at two access bridges during a four-day holiday in April so it could turn back visitors if numbers became overwhelming.
Many of Thailand’s marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October during the monsoon season but because of Maya Bay’s popularity, it hasn’t had a break since a Hollywood crew set foot on its sands in 1999 to film the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland. Its corals have been decimated by the suffocating clouds of sand and sediment churned up by speedboats.
“I tried to push this campaign for many, many years, but you know in Thailand we are a tourism industry country and we need a lot of money, so before not so many people listened,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine biologist and member of a government committee on development and the environment.
“It should have been done 10 years ago but at least it has been done,” he said.
Thailand had about 35 million international visitors last year, a five-fold increase in little more than two decades.
Shi Pengfei, among the last tourists to visit Maya Bay before its closure, said he had no idea that there would be so many people on the beach.
“I feel that there are so many people here,” said Shi, from Henan, China. “The government’s plan to close off the beach for a few months is only natural because the ocean needs a break, a chance to recover, so that the next generation can have a better and even more beautiful destination.”
But locals aren’t entirely happy. The head of the Phi Phi Tourist Business Association, Watrapol Jantharo, said he was surprised when the closure was announced in March by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
He said locals were under the impression that Maya Bay would only be closed to boats, while visitors would still walk to the bay from the other side of the island.
“We are not against protecting our environment,” he said. “We know full well that Maya Bay is our important resource, like a rice field to a farmer, but we wish there are more communications about the government’s plan before the decision was made.”
Thon, however, said the plan was discussed with locals for three years before a decision was made.
“In the past, we made some mistake because we think that the money is very important. But now we are trying to change our idea,” he said. Overseas visitors are “very important to our country, but the most important thing is our national resource. We have to preserve and hand it to the next generation.”
The government has set a limit of 2,000 tourists a day when the bay reopens — about half the current number. Boats will no longer be allowed to anchor but must dock on the opposite side of the island.
“Now that the government has this plan, we can’t change it. But we could use this opportunity to tell the world that we do not just have Maya Bay. There are 10 other beautiful beaches and islands around here that tourists can enjoy,” said Watrapol.
Thailand’s efforts to protect certain islands after decades of unregulated tourism began about three years ago under the current military junta, which has banned the types of protests such moves may have sparked had they been announced by civilian governments.
Yoong Island, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Tachai Island in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off-limits to tourists since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said he was amazed by the results. Waters that were devoid of fish are now teeming, he said, and there is about 10,000 square meters (107,600 square feet) of newly recovered coral off one of the islands.
At Maya Bay, park rangers have been preparing a coral propagation program, attaching it to rocks that will be placed in the bay once the tourists are gone.
“We’re almost certain that something good will happen in Maya Bay,” Thon said.

BANGKOK: The daily hordes of tourists have exhausted the Thai beach made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie.
Maya Bay, on Phi Phi Leh island in the Andaman Sea, will be closed to all visitors for four months annually starting this June to allow for the recovery of the battered coral reefs and sea life. The decision to keep visitors away was made Wednesday by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
“It’s like someone who has been working for decades and has never stopped,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a prominent marine scientist and member of Thailand’s national strategy committee on environment development. “Overworked and tired, all the beauty of the beach is gone. We need a timeout for the beach.”
Many Thai marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October, but because of tourist demand, Maya Bay has remained open year-round since a Hollywood crew set foot there in 1999 to film “The Beach,” the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland.
The beach receives an average of 200 boats and 4,000 visitors each day. Recent surveys by a team led by marine biologists found a large part of the coral reefs around the area is gone and sea life has virtually disappeared.
Other Southeast Asian beach resorts are under threat too.
In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has vowed to close Boracay, a small central island popular for its powdery white sand beaches and vibrant nightlife, saying it has become a “cesspool.”
“Their waste would go directly to the ocean. The germ content is already very high there,” Duterte said last week. “It only looks good because of the white coastline.”
His top environmental officials say Boracay may be closed in the last week of April after a 30-day notice is issued and the tropical island placed under a state of calamity to allow the government to extend emergency funds to affected villagers and establishments.
During the closure, which could last six months or less, a massive cleanup is planned and noncompliant beach resorts and other establishments would have to install waste treatment and disposal systems to halt further contamination. Boracay drew more than 1 million tourists last year mostly from Asia, the United States and Europe.
Boracay officials may face administrative cases for allowing environmental laws to be breached for years and for failing to regulate the influx of tourists beyond the island’s capacity.
Thon said the Thai beach’s temporary closing will kick-start the rehabilitation process.
“If you ask me if it is too late to save our islands, the answer is no. But if we don’t do something today, it will be too late,” said Thanya Netithammakum, head of the National Parks and Wildlife Department.
When Maya Bay reopens, the department will set a daily limit of 2,000 tourists, while boats will no longer be allowed to anchor there and will have to dock on the opposite side of the island at floating piers.
The number of visitors the beach has been seeing is unsustainable, and a temporary closure is better than nothing, Thon said.
“The locals know that and we all know that,” he said. “This would be a good way to start managing our tourist destinations. And we can improve on what we learn after the first year. We know that it’s important we manage our resources well. It’s not about more numbers of tourists but about sustainable tourism that benefit locals as well.”
More than 35 million tourists visited Thailand last year, compared to around 10 million when “The Beach” premiered in 2000.
Thai authorities have in the past closed off islands ruined by mass tourism. Koh Yoong, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Koh Tachai, in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off limits to tourists permanently since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said the results have been amazing. Areas with a bleak sea life environment and coral bleaching are now teeming with robust and colorful sea life and coral, he said. He’s certain that the annual closure will also help restore Maya Bay.
“I have always dreamt that one day we could work to bring her back to life. I have been following and working on Maya Bay for more than 30 years. I had seen it when it was a heaven and I see it when it has nothing left. Anything that we can do to bring this paradise back to Thailand is the dream of a marine biologist,” he said.

IFEROUANE: Tuaregs in northern Niger are hoping to draw tourists back to the region by putting their traditional dances, music poetry and camel races on display.
Despite concerns about Islamic extremism throughout the Sahel region in West Africa, organizers recently hosted more than 1,000 visitors to a cultural festical in Iferouane, a village in Niger’s far north.
“Without tourism, our youth risks falling into idleness and misery, and will join the wave of migration to Europe,” said Mohamed Houma, the mayor of the town located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the central city of Agadez.
The Air festival, considered one of the most important gatherings to celebrate the culture of the Tuareg people, has been held since 2001.
It was marked last month by the sound of tende, the Tuareg style of music and drumming, as the women and men, on foot and on their camels, participated in song and dance competitions.
Since 2001, the gatherings have been held to celebrate the culture of the semi-nomadic Tuareg people. More than 2 million Tuaregs live in the Sahara Desert area, stretching across Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria and Tunisia.
Niger’s Air region, with oases, mountains and sand dunes, has been a destination for adventurous Western tourists since the 1980s and the visitors have been a financial boon for the region. But the tourism has dwindled since the Tuareg rebellion, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, and from the proliferation of armed and extremist groups in the Sahel region.
Security guards watched over the dozen French and Belgian tourists who participated this year’s in Air Festival.
“We are very happy because this festival shows the rest of the world that despite the international geopolitical and security context, we live here in peace, sheltered from the upheavals of some of our neighboring countries,” Houma said.
French tourists to the festival this year included Jacques Maire, a French legislator who heads a France-Niger Friendship group in the French National Assembly.
While the situation in Niger is tense, he said it is not the worst in the region.
“There has always been a strong French appetite for the Sahara,” said Maire. “We must seize every opportunity to recreate tourist flows.”

PHOENIX: Arizona officials on Friday guaranteed that Grand Canyon National Park will remain in full operation if Congress fails to pass a budget and a government shutdown ensues.
Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said the state’s top tourist attraction “will not close on our watch, period.”
Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak says the state’s parks and tourism agencies plan to provide up to $100,000 to ensure lodging, campgrounds and restaurants remain open, and more funding if needed.
The state agencies have been working with the National Park Service to plan for a possible shutdown as early as Saturday if Congress fails to pass a government funding bill. The House passed a temporary government funding bill Thursday night, but the Senate was deadlocked.
President Donald Trump and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer met Friday afternoon in an eleventh-hour effort to avert a shutdown. The impasse is over federal spending and legislation to protect some 700,000 younger immigrants from deportation.
“If Washington, D.C. won’t function, Arizona will,” Ducey said in a statement. “Don’t change your travel plans, because Arizona is open for business — regardless of what happens back in Congress.”
The U.S. Interior Department said national parks and other public lands will remain as accessible as possible if a shutdown happens. That’s a change from previous shutdowns, when most parks were closed and became high-profile symbols of dysfunction.
But spokeswoman Heather Swift said services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds, full-service restrooms and concessions won’t be operating in most locations.
Arizona’s decision to guarantee funding to cover the cost of those services means they should operate at the Grand Canyon as normal if a shutdown occurs.
Arizona paid about $100,000 a day to cover the full cost of keeping the Grand Canyon open during the last shutdown in 2013 but was eventually reimbursed by the federal government. Former Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, worked to pay the National Park Service $651,000 to keep the popular tourist destination open for a week. That came after a shutdown that lasted more than a week.
Federal lawmakers reached an agreement on the budget before those seven days were up.
During a 1995 shutdown, Arizona’s governor famously led a convoy of unarmed troops to the park’s gate to demand it be opened.
They were met there by the park superintendent, who negotiated with then-Gov. Fife Symington, a Republican, for a partial reopening if the budget impasse continued.
The shutdown was briefly solved, but when the parks were again closed a month later, the state paid more than $17,000 a day to keep the road to the Grand Canyon Village and the Mather Point scenic viewpoint on the canyon’s South Rim open.

LAMJUNG: A number of domestic tourists visiting a historical site of Rainaskot in Lamjung district has increased significantly.
Home stay, started after renovation of an earthquake affected houses are now packed with the domestic tourists. It is being run in a total of 14 houses which are built with the modern techniques where 84 tourists can be accommodated at once.
The concept of home stay in Rainaskot begun with American national Natasha Wajniyak providing a fund of Rs 20.75 million to renovate the quake affected houses according to Sarbodaya Old Age Home’s Chairperson Krishna Raj Oliya.
One of the home stay entrepreneurs in Rainaskot, Dilmaya Gurung informed that the domestic tourists are also provided the opportunities of observing the local cultural programs during their stay.
“Besides, tasting the local organic foods, domestic tourists also can experience the local cultures,” said Gurung. Since the Rainaskot has a big Gurung population, a museum related to that caste also has been established.
Meanwhile Rainaskot Tourism Committee’s Chairperson Khadak Bahadur Gurung expressed his hope of attracting even bigger number of the domestic tourists in the future. Visitors can reach the site after two hours of bus ride and three hours of hike from Paudi, a gateway of Lamjung district.
Mesmerizing views of 18 mountain ranges including Annapurna and Machchapuchhre can be seen from the Rainaskot.

MADRID, SPAIN:  A passenger on a delayed Ryanair flight from London who apparently got fed up waiting to get off a plane after it landed in the southern Spanish city of Malaga surprised fellow passengers by using the emergency exit to jump onto a wing.
The incident on New Year’s Day took place 30 minutes after the flight from Stansted Airport landed.
The man, who has not been named but is said to be a non-Spanish citizen, was coaxed back onto the plane while police were called.
Fellow passenger Fernando del Valle Villalobos, who videoed the incident, said he heard the man say he got fed up waiting.
“I was astonished,” del Valle, 25, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
He said the passengers were standing in the aisle waiting to get off the plane when the man “very calmly asked permission to get past, opened the emergency exit, looked out, saw the wing, went back for his back-pack.”
Later, he said the captain came out and asked the man why he had done it and del Valle heard him say clearly that he was sick of waiting inside. The passengers, except the man in question, were kept a further 15 minutes on the plane before being let off.
Police said Wednesday that they have opened a complaint against the man for breaching security.
Ryanair said the incident was now in the hands of Spanish authorities.

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA: While much of the nation shivers in bone-aching cold, people in Alaska’s largest city are basking in warmer weather, jogging in short sleeves, ice-skating in T-shirts or walking dogs while just lightly bundled up.
Anchorage saw an official high of 44 degrees Tuesday, tying the record set in 1981 and 2011. That was warm enough for Patricia Bierer, who was visiting Alaska this winter from Montana.
“I am from the Bitterroot Valley in Montana, and it’s colder there today than it is here in Alaska,” said Bierer, dressed in a pink parka as she strolled with family members around Anchorage’s Westchester Lagoon. “And my children that are there are jealous because I’ve got 40-degree temperatures here.”
National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Kurtz said areas of high and low pressure are working together to push tropical air to the north. But temperatures are expected to begin dropping Tuesday night, and below freezing by Wednesday. That freeze-thaw vacillation should bring slick conditions to the area.
“I jokingly refer to it as freezy, skid stuff,” Kurtz said.
It comes as the weather service issued wind chill advisories and freeze warnings covering a vast area, from South Texas to Canada and from Montana to Maine.

A large swath of the US is freezing under Alaska-like weather, but parts of the nation’s northernmost state itself are basking in balmy conditions. Tuesday’s official temperature hit a record 45 degrees in Anchorage. (Jan. 2)

The unseasonable temperatures brought Anchorage resident Cassandra Sullivan out to walk her pit bull Athena along downtown streets. She said it helped jolt her out of the winter blues.
“For some reason, with the weather out today as it is and just the breeze and the warm air, it kind of brings me out of it,” she said.
Ashley Durst, walking her dog at the downtown lagoon during her lunch break, admitted that the warmer weather was a little unusual because it can be minus-30 this time of the year.
But she doesn’t mind that others are feeling that bite instead. “I just think maybe it’s time they get their little taste of it for a while,” she said with a smile.

LAS VEGAS: Las Vegas welcomed 2018 with fireworks, big-ticket musical acts and unprecedented security in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in US modern history just three months ago.
Law enforcement officers kept a close eye Monday on the estimated 330,000 people who traveled from all over the US and beyond to pack in the Las Vegas Strip and downtown’s Fremont Street. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had every officer working throughout the weekend and was aided by the Nevada National Guard and federal agents.
Rosy-cheeked visitors took selfies and livestreamed the celebration amid temperatures in the mid-40s (4 Celsius), much warmer than most of the US. They wore glittery hats, tiaras and other 2018-themed paraphernalia as they hugged and cheered on the new year.
“One bad incident is not going to deter us from having a good time,” Honolulu resident Pettra Stark, who planned her trip after the Oct. 1 shooting, said while standing underneath the massive video canopy on Fremont Street.
For Stark, the heavy presence of armed officers was reassuring. But not everyone felt the same way, including Adrian Dominguez, who traveled for the festivities with 10 other relatives.
“It’s not pleasant to see so many officers,” Dominguez, a resident of the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Juarez. “They are everywhere.”
The heightened security comes after a high-stakes gambler killed 58 and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below before killing himself.
On Saturday, two security guards were fatally shot while investigating a disturbance at Arizona Charlie’s Decatur, a hotel-casino just west of the Strip. Police said the suspect was hospitalized with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities described it as an isolated incident and assured that it was not terrorism-related.
A roughly eight-minute fireworks display at the top of seven of the city’s world-famous casino-hotels started at the Stratosphere 10 seconds before midnight Monday and continued to Venetian, Treasure Island, Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Aria and MGM Grand. More than 80,000 pyrotechnic firings that illuminated the sky in gold, red and green.
Megastars performed at venues up and down the Strip. The Foo Fighters played at The Chelsea at The Cosmopolitan, Maroon 5 was at the Mandalay Bay Events Center and Britney Spears performed at The Axis at Planet Hollywood.
At a lower-key celebration in downtown Las Vegas’ casino-flanked Fremont Street Experience, bands played under a massive video canopy while visitors danced and sipped giant beers.
Las Vegas police officer Larry Hadfield on Monday said there were no incidents related to the festivities to speak of. The Nevada Highway Patrol on Twitter reported the arrest of two suspected impaired drivers near the Strip.
Police cruisers, dump trucks and other large vehicles blocked key intersections during the night to try to prevent anyone from plowing into crowds.
Strollers, backpacks, large bags, coolers and glass bottles were banned from the Strip for the night. Ticket holders for the celebration on Freemont Street Experienced went through checkpoints where security guards used hand-held metal detectors.
New Year’s Eve is worth an estimated $254.3 million to Las Vegas, according to the city’s Convention and Visitors Authority. More than 97 percent of the destination’s nearly 149,000 hotel and motel rooms were expected to be booked.

Canada is more than just its great mountains, wild moose-spotting road trips and craggy-coast good looks. Its endless variety of landscapes might keep you busy the first few days but what would a traveller look for beyond the great outdoors? Its captivating culture will engulf you; from west to east, a foodie’s paradise your palates would be thoroughly refreshed and thriving cities with their own artistic flair will surprise you. But if you’re looking to weave stories out of adventures for years to come here are a few places that you must check out.

Venture into the woods

If snuggled in a sphere suspended atop the forest canopy of Vancouver Island in the middle of nowhere is what excites you then a visit to the Free Spirit Spheres is a must. It’s part Middle Earth fantasy and part childhood dream, you’ll find large wooden orbs suspended from the trees. Take the spiral staircase and short suspension bridge leading up to them and enter into the sphere to experience nature from a different perspective.
Designed to look vaguely like enormous nuts or seeds, the cedar and spruce spheres borrow from and collaborate with the surrounding environment. The spheres are made of fibreglass and wood, and borrow heavily from sailboat construction methods. Inside the curving walls complete with portholes for windows, space is maximised with fold-out tables and mirrors, curved loft beds and benches, and tiny appliances. Touted as ‘the ultimate tree-house experience,’ these Free Spirit Spheres can be rented overnight.

Brace yourself

Mazes and labyrinths reached its zenith as a form in Renaissance England, more as a device for
entertainment than serious purpose. Today VanDusen Garden in Vancouver is one of only six in North America.
It carries on the tradition of Elizabethan hedge mazes in North America. The maze is made of 3,000 pyramidal cedars — Thuja occidentalis ‘Fastigiata’ to be specific was planted in the autumn of 1981 and slowly grown into the form of the maze one finds today.
Named after local lumber magnate and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen, this garden is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. In addition to the maze, the gardens cover 55 acres and displays plants from around the world. There is an observation terrace from which the less adventuresome visitor can view the maze and the struggles of its confused occupants.

For your eyes only

A book collector’s dream, The Monkey’s Paw in Toronto has the world’s first ‘Biblio-Mat’, a
random book vending machine.  All of the books lining the shelves of Stephen Fowler’s bookstore are ones you couldn’t possibly find anywhere else. He opened The Monkey’s Paw in March 2006 and since then it has been a haven for antiquarians, complete with
medical drawings on the wall and a stuffed crow on a typewriter.
The unusual store, named after a horror short story by author WW Jacobs, has a diverse range of old books. Fowler selects each book to fit these categories: the beautiful, the arcane, the macabre and the absurd. For some its charm may be the custom-made Biblio-Mat, a vending machine that will dispense a randomly selected vintage volume for $2, a surprise you might want to see for yourself.

Fairytale escape

An old world fairytale-land with over 350 fairy folk figurines hidden amongst 800-year old cedars is something that will surely lure you in. Artist Doris Needham and her husband Ernest needed a place to put her hand-sculpted cement creations, so they bought a forest in British Columbia and filled it with enchanted figures from fairytales and nursery rhymes.
When Rogers Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needhams’ unusual haven; one just cannot drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house.
The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage, or a favourite
nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. Take the Nature Walk, a 2-km walk through the lush Canadian forest, where you’ll discover many trees, including an 800-year-old cedar grove. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest tree house in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old
cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.

Jewel in the crown

As their contribution to Montreal’s 1967 World’s Fair Exposition the United States government
commissioned architect, scientist, and well-known genius Buckminster Fuller to design a pavilion for the Canadian exhibition.
Fuller, who popularised, perfected, and named the Geodesic Dome, designed a 20-storey-tall dome in the fashion of his hallmark design to represent the USA. Done in a full two-thirds sphere, rather than the typical half dome, the massive steel structure was seen and admired by over 5.6 million visitors who went into the dome to see exhibits from actual spaceships from the Apollo missions to American works of art.  The dome’s steel skeleton was fitted with a clear acrylic covering, making the structure look like a massive, glittering jewel.
When the fair ended, the pavilion remained, securing the dome’s place in Montreal’s landscape. This relic of the 67 Expo survived fire and ice; it was reopened and was re-purposed as a museum devoted to environmental action. Today the Biosphere of Montreal remains, a sturdy and beautiful example of ‘Bucky’s’ geodesic architecture.

Work of art

Comprised of 15,000 tonnes of snow and 500,000 tonnes of ice, the Hôtel de Glace is a massive undertaking, a stunning yet ephemeral work of art and architecture entirely built of snow and ice. Every winter, this unique hotel is completely redesigned and rebuilt, offering an unforgettable experience in the only hotel of its kind in North America.
Whether for a guided tour, a Nordic overnight stay, a wedding or a private function, the Hôtel de Glace is sure to dazzle visitors with its unique style and spellbinding décor. Guests can choose to enjoy a cocktail served in a glass made of ice or spend the night in one of the 44 theme rooms and suites and relax in the outdoor hot tubs and sauna.
Every inch of the hotel is created out of ice, including the furniture. To make the rooms more liveable, beds are covered with furs, blankets and sleeping bags tested to arctic temperatures. Although you might not get four-star service, the attraction has seduced over a million people around the world since its opening in 2001. Only 4-km from the north end of Québec City
a visit might just add to your Canada experience.  – Compiled

WASHINGTON: House Democrats are poised to unveil two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — with an announcement expected early Tuesday.

Democratic leaders say Trump put US elections and national security at risk when he asked Ukraine to investigate his rivals, including Joe Biden.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined during an event Monday evening to discuss the articles or the coming announcement. Details were shared by multiple people familiar with the discussions but unauthorised to discuss them and granted anonymity.
When asked if she has enough votes to impeach the Republican president, the Democratic leader said she would let House lawmakers vote their conscience.
“On an issue like this, we don’t count the votes. People will just make their voices known on it,” Pelosi said at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council. “I haven’t counted votes, nor will I.”
The outcome, though, appears increasingly set as the House prepares to vote, as it has only three times in history against a US president.
Trump spent part of the day tweeting against the impeachment proceedings but did not immediately respond late Monday. The president and his allies have railed against the “absurd” proceedings.
Pelosi convened a meeting of the impeachment committee chairmen at her office in the Capitol late Monday following an acrimonious, nearly 10-hour hearing at the Judiciary Committee, which could vote as soon as this week.
“I think there’s a lot of agreement,” Rep Eliot Engel of New York, the Democratic chairman of the Foreign Affairs committee, told reporters as he exited Pelosi’s office. “A lot of us believe that what happened with Ukraine especially is not something we can just close our eyes to.”
At the Judiciary hearing, Democrats said Trump’s push to have Ukraine investigate rival Joe Biden while withholding US military aid ran counter to US policy and benefited Russia as well as himself.
“President Trump’s persistent and continuing effort to coerce a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election is a clear and present danger to our free and fair elections and to our national security,” said Dan Goldman, the director of investigations at the House Intelligence Committee, presenting the finding of the panel’s 300-page report of the inquiry.
Republicans rejected not just Goldman’s conclusion of the Ukraine matter; they also questioned his very appearance before the Judiciary panel. In a series of heated exchanges, they said Rep Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, should appear rather than sending his lawyer.
From the White House, Trump tweeted repeatedly, assailing the “Witch Hunt!” and “Do Nothing Democrats.”
In drafting the articles of impeachment, Pelosi is facing a legal and political challenge of balancing the views of her majority while hitting the Constitution’s bar of “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanours.”
Some liberal lawmakers wanted more expansive charges encompassing the findings from former special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Centrist Democrats preferred to keep the impeachment articles more focused on Trump’s actions toward Ukraine.
Rep Jerrold Nadler, D-NY, was blunt as he opened Monday’s hearing, saying, “President Trump put himself before country.”
Trump’s conduct, Nadler said at the end of the daylong hearing, “is clearly impeachable.”
Rep Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the committee, said Democrats are racing to jam impeachment through on a “clock and a calendar” ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
“They can’t get over the fact that Donald Trump is the president of the United States, and they don’t have a candidate that can beat him,” Collins said.
In one testy exchange, Republican attorney Stephen Castor dismissed the transcript of Trump’s crucial call with Ukraine as “eight ambiguous lines” that did not amount to the president seeking a personal political favour.
Democrats argued vigorously that Trump’s meaning could not have been clearer in seeking political dirt on Biden, his possible opponent in the 2020 election.
The Republicans tried numerous times to halt or slow the proceedings, and the hearing was briefly interrupted early on by a protester shouting, “We voted for Donald Trump!” The protester was escorted from the House hearing room by Capitol Police.
The White House is refusing to participate in the impeachment process. Trump and and his allies acknowledge he likely will be impeached in the Democratic-controlled House, but they also expect acquittal next year in the Senate, where Republicans have the majority.
The president was focused instead on Monday’s long-awaited release of the Justice Department report into the 2016 Russia investigation. The inspector general found that the FBI was justified in opening its investigation into ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia and that the FBI did not act with political bias, despite “serious performance failures” up the bureau’s chain of command.
Democrats say Trump abused his power in a July 25 phone call when he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for a favour in investigating Democrats. That was bribery, they say, since Trump was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid that Ukraine depended on to counter Russian aggression.
Pelosi and Democrats point to what they call a pattern of misconduct by Trump in seeking foreign interference in elections from Mueller’s inquiry of the Russia probe to Ukraine.
In his report, Mueller said he could not determine that Trump’s campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia in the 2016 election. But Mueller said he could not exonerate Trump of obstructing justice in the probe and left it for Congress to determine.

PRAGUE: Six people were killed and two more wounded in a shooting in a hospital in the eastern Czech Republic Tuesday, the prime minister said. The apparent suspect later shot himself dead as police approached his car.

Prime Minister Andrej Babis told Czech public television the shooting took place around 7 am in a waiting room. The attacker opened fire at people’s heads from close range, Babis said.
He said he was heading for the site, at the University hospital in the eastern city of Ostrava, 350 kilometres (220 miles) east of Prague.
Police said they found the suspect’s car and he shot himself in the head as they approached. They identified him as a 42-year-old man. Police had launched an extensive manhunt, using two helicopters, for the suspect and his silver-gray Renault Laguna car.
Police published a photo of the suspect, having withdrawn an earlier photo of a different man. They said that man was now considered to be a witness.
Clinic director Jiri Havrlant told media the dead were four men and two women. Another man and a woman had to be operated on.
Officials say people have been evacuated from the clinic. Police are boosting security across the country.

398,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/us-canadian-officials-converge-on-mexico-city-to-seal-final-changes-to-trade-deal/,"WASHINGTON: Senior US and Canadian officials were set to fly to Mexico City on Tuesday to work on the final changes to a languishing North American trade pact that could clear the way for a vote in the US Congress before the end of the year.
US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday night she expected the final language of the US-Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) to be set by Tuesday, which would bring Democrats to a “moment of truth” on whether to proceed to passage.
“We’re close. We’re not quite finished yet, we’re within range,” Pelosi told a forum of chief executives on Monday evening, adding that she was working on the language of separate legislation on how the deal would be implemented.

The Trump administration and Democrats in the US House of Representatives are closing in on a deal following several intense days of negotiations with Mexico over potential changes to clauses concerning labor enforcement, steel and aluminum, biologic drugs and internet services.
US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner are due to fly to Mexico City on Tuesday for meetings to try to pin down final details, an administration official told Reuters late Monday afternoon.
They will be joined by Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, a spokesman for Freeland said.
As House speaker, Pelosi will decide whether and when to bring the trade legislation to the floor for a vote.
The USMCA, which would replace the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), encompasses $1.2 trillion in annual trade across the continent. Its backers say it is responsible for 12 million US jobs and a third of all US agricultural exports.
It needs to be approved by lawmakers in all three countries. US Democrats have been reluctant to vote to give a political victory to Republican President Donald Trump.
And time is running out. US lawmakers from both parties say that waiting until next year could make it more difficult to ratify because the presidential election campaign – and perhaps impeachment proceedings against Trump – will be in full swing.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal told reporters he was “delighted” that a deal was close at hand, and was convinced it would offer better protection for workers. “I voted against the original NAFTA,” he said. “By any objective standard, this is substantially improved.”
Democrats said they were waiting to see the changes they had proposed in writing before signing off.
“I want to see it. The written word is always important,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat and member of the working group that has negotiated with the Trump administration.
Since negotiations to replace NAFTA first started in August 2017, deals have been imminent numerous times, only to be delayed by last–minute hitches.
Leaders of the United States, Canada, and Mexico signed the initial USMCA agreement more than a year ago, but since then, Democrats controlling the House have pressed for changes to strengthen the enforcement of new labor standard.
They also have pressed for removal of a provision that grants big internet services providers liability protections for third party content, and are seeking to relax data protections for biologic drugs that they fear will mean higher drug prices.
Lighthizer last week also added a new demand – that the trade deal strengthen the automotive rules origin to include steel and aluminum that is “melted and poured” in North America.
The prior requirement that 70% of the steel and aluminum in North American cars come from the region did not specify a production method, opening the door to the used of semi-finished metals from China and elsewhere.
Trump, who blamed NAFTA for the loss of millions of American factory jobs during his 2016 re-election campaign and vowed to quit or renegotiate it, said on Monday that “a lot of strides have been made over the last 24 hours” on USMCA.
“I’m hearing very good things. I’m hearing from unions and others that it’s looking good,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
Trump spoke earlier with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka about the negotiations, a person familiar with the call said.
Trumka, one of the most powerful US labor leaders, has been a major party to the negotiations, pushing for stronger labor enforcement provisions that ensure Mexican workers are allowed to unionize.

MEXICAN SENATORS ENDORSE CHANGES
Details of the proposed changes have not been disclosed. Mexican officials rejected US demands to allow US factory inspectors to supervise labor enforcement, but have said that Mexico would allow panels of experts and a third party to review labor standards.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that Mexican senators had endorsed changes to USMCA that had been accepted by Mexico. He urged Pelosi to move forward with a vote on the trade deal.
US Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley spoke with Lighthizer about the pact on Monday and is hoping for a deal announcement soon, said Grassley’s spokesman, Michael Zona.
Congress had been scheduled to leave Washington by the end of this week, but consideration of spending and defense bills is likely to keep lawmakers working for a few more days beyond that.
US-China trade talks are also set to come to a head this week. New US tariffs on some $156 billion worth of Chinese consumer goods are due to take effect on Sunday unless an interim deal is reached before then.

The Hercules C130 aircraft took off at 4:55 p.m. (1955 GMT) from the southern city of Punta Arenas and operators lost contact with it shortly after 6:00 p.m.
“On board the C130 Hercules are 38 people, of which 17 are crew members of the aircraft and 21 are passengers,” the Air Force said in a statement.
A state of alert was declared after communication with plane was lost, and a search and rescue team was activated.

It said the military had declared an alert and activated search and rescue teams.
The C-130 Hercules carried 17 crew members and 21 passengers, including three civilians. The personnel were to check on a floating fuel supply line and other equipment at the Chilean base.
President Sebastián Piñera said via Twitter that he was with his defence and interior ministers at the air force headquarters monitoring developments.
The plane took off at 4:55 pm from the southern city of Punta Arenas, which is more than 3,000 kilometres (1,860 miles) from the capital of Santiago. Contact was lost at 6:13 pm, the statement said.
General Eduardo Mosqueira of the Fourth Air Brigade told local media that a search was underway and a ship was in the area where the plane should have been when contact was lost.
Mosqueira said the aircraft would have been about halfway to the Antarctic base when it lost contact. No emergency signals had been activated, he said.
He said the plane, whose pilot had extensive experience, had been scheduled to return Monday night.

401,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/up-to-13-feared-dead-in-volcanic-eruption-off-new-zealand/,"WHAKATANE: Unstable conditions hampered rescue workers Tuesday from searching for at least eight people missing and feared dead after a volcano off the New Zealand coast erupted in a towering blast of ash and scalding steam while dozens of tourists explored its moon-like surface. Five deaths have been confirmed.
After Monday afternoon’s eruption, helicopter crews had landed on White Island despite the danger and helped evacuate many survivors, some of them suffering critical burns. But officials said Tuesday they were still working with scientific experts to determine when it would be safe to return to the island to search for the missing.
Aircraft have flown over the island repeatedly, and “no signs of life have been seen at any point,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.
Russell Clark, an intensive care paramedic worker, said the scene looked like the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, “just blanketed in ash.

The eruption sent a plume of steam and ash an estimated 12,000 feet (3,660 metres) into the air. One of the rescue boats that returned from the island was covered with ash half a meter (yard) thick, Ardern said.
“It was quite an overwhelming feeling. There was a helicopter on the island that had obviously been there at the time, with its rotor blades off it,” Clark told New Zealand broadcaster TVNZ. “I can only imagine what it was like for the people there at the time — they had nowhere to go.
“We didn’t find any survivors on the island,” Clark said. “It would’ve been quite traumatic for them.”
White Island, also known by the indigenous Maori name Whakaari, is the tip of an undersea volcano some 30 miles (50 kilometres) off mainland New Zealand. Scientists had noted an uptick in volcanic activity in recent weeks, and questions were being raised about why tourists were still being allowed on the island.
Many of the 47 visitors on the island at the time of the eruption were Australian, and Ardern said New Zealanders and tourists from the United States, China, Britain and Malaysia were also affected. Some of the visitors were passengers from the Royal Caribbean cruise ship Ovation of the Seas.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said 11 Australians are unaccounted for and 13 were hospitalized. Three Australians were suspected to be among the initial five confirmed dead, he told reporters in Sydney. “I fear there is worse news to come,” Morrison said.
Relatives of a newlywed American couple say the husband and wife were severely burned. Barbara Barham told The Washington Post that her daughter Lauren Urey, 32, and son-in-law Matthew Urey, 36, from Richmond, Virginia, were on a honeymoon trip.
A few locals laid flowers Tuesday at a fence on the waterfront near where the rescue boats had returned with the injured, many of whom were flown to hospital burn units around the country.
New Zealand’s GeoNet seismic monitoring agency had raised the volcano’s alert level on Nov. 18 from 1 to 2 on a scale where 5 represents a major eruption, noting an increase in sulfur dioxide gas, which originates from magma deep in the volcano. It also said that volcanic tremors had increased from weak to moderate strength. It raised the alert level to 4 for a time after Monday’s eruption but lowered it to 3 as activity subsided.
Ardern said White Island is a “very unpredictable volcano,” and questions about whether tourists should be visiting will have to be addressed, “but for now, we’re focused on those who are caught up in this horrific event.”
Brad Scott, a volcanologist with research group GNS Science, said the alert level on White Island is often raised and then dropped without any eruption. He said there hadn’t been any major problems with tourists visiting the island in the past, though there had been some close calls.
He would not venture an opinion on whether it was safe enough for tourists immediately before Monday’s eruption.
“In the scheme of things, for volcanic eruptions, it is not large,” said Ken Gledhill from GeoNet. “But if you were close to that, it is not good.”
Richard Arculus, an Australian National University volcanologist who has made numerous visits to White Island, said the eruption likely sent a ground-hugging lateral blast from the crater to the jetty, as well as blasting rock and ash vertically skyward.
“In that crater, it would have been a terrible place to be,” Arculus said. “There would have been nowhere safe for you to be hiding, thinking that: ‘Oh well, if it explodes, it just goes straight up in the air.'”
White Island is New Zealand’s most active cone volcano. About 70% of the volcano lies under the sea.
Twelve people were killed on the island in 1914 when it was being mined for sulfur. Part of a crater wall collapsed and a landslide destroyed the miners’ village and the mine itself.
The remains of buildings from another mining enterprise in the 1920s are now a tourist attraction. The island became a private scenic reserve in 1953, and daily tours allow more than 10,000 people to visit every year.

402,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/hong-kong-braces-for-wave-of-store-closures-after-protests-hkrma/,"HONG KONG: More than one in 10 retailers in Hong Kong could close down in the next six months as social unrest and sometimes violent protests deter tourists, threatening the survival of smaller operators, the city’s main retailing group said on Monday.
Some 7,000 licensed retail establishments out of 64,000 in the Asian financial hub say they will be forced to close down in the next six months, the Hong Kong Retail Management Association said (HKRMA) after surveying its members.
The survey highlights the dire outlook for retailers after months of anti-Beijing protests, with Hong Kong normally a top shopping destination for Chinese tourists.
Retail sales fell by a quarter in October from a year earlier, the steepest drop on record, while tourist arrivals fell by a whopping 43.7% in the same month, squeezing malls and restaurants.
“We are talking about survival among retailers,” the HKRMA’s chairwoman, Annie Tse Yau On-yee, said. “It is going to be quite serious.”
The government has pledged a total of HK$25 billion ($3.2 billion) in economic support measures but it remains to seen whether that will be enough to help the economy, and retailers, weather the storm.
HKRMA said about 97% of survey respondents had recorded losses since the unrest began in June. Of those, 30% said they would be forced to lay off staff in the next six months – losing 10% of employees on average, or more than 5,600 people in total.
The survey, which covered chain stores and small retailers, was conducted between October 29 and November 22 and recorded the views of 176 companies, operating 4,310 stores.
HKRMA has urged more support and relief measures from the government while also encouraging landlords to offer rent cuts to help retailers.

403,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/french-unions-dig-in-against-macron-on-fifth-day-of-strikes/,"PARIS: Drivers on two Paris metro lines voted on Monday to extend a walkout until the end of the week as France grappled with the fifth day of strikes, a sign transport workers will keep up a fight against President Emmanuel Macron‘s plans to streamline pensions.
The week ahead will test Macron‘s mettle and his ability to deliver the social and economic change he says is necessary for France to compete with powers like China and the United States.
The public sector strike has hit the transport sector the hardest. In Paris, train, bus and metro services faced severe disruption and monster tailbacks clogged the roads as commuters took to their cars.
After months of consultations, Macron‘s pension tsar Jean-Paul Delevoye is scheduled to meet union leaders later on Monday before presenting his reform proposals to Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.
“We will see if he has not just listened, but heard,” Philippe Martinez, leader of the CGT union, France’s largest in the public sector, told France Info radio. “They have to pull the reform.”
That appears unlikely. Philippe told the weekly Journal du Dimanche that he was determined to see through the overhaul of what is one of the most generous pension systems among developed industrialised nations.
The unions have called for mass protests on Tuesday and the government will be watching closely to see if more than the 800,000 who marched through French cities on Thursday turned out.
Macron wants to replace the convoluted system comprised of more than 40 separate pension plans, each with varying benefits, with a single, points-based system under which for each euro contributed, every pensioner has equal rights.
Public sector unions fret that their workers will come out worse because under the current system the state makes up for the chronic shortfall between contributions and payouts in the sector.
The unions, fighting to show they remain relevant after Macron loosened the labour code and reformed the state-run SNCF, also fret they will lose influence over contributions and benefits under a centrally managed points-based system.
Who emerges victor will in part hinge on the battle for public opinion. Opinion polls ahead of the strikes showed the public was relatively evenly split. On the metro on Monday, there was both sympathy and irritation towards the strikers.
“I don’t understand. It’s not the right way to do things, for (metro operator) RATP to block people like this,” said commuter Charles Ramm. “It will turn against the unions.”
Accountant Lamia Massoudi said she backed the strike, even if meant inconveniences. “I’m with them,” Massoudi said.

WADA bans Russia from Olympics for four years
Laboratory data tampering behind latest scandal

MOSCOW: Russia was banned from the Olympics and world championships in a range of sports for four years on Monday after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ruled to punish it for manipulating laboratory data, a WADA spokesman said.
WADA’s executive committee took the decision after it concluded that Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats.
The WADA committee’s decision to punish Russia with a ban was unanimous, the spokesman said.
Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a global sports power, has been embroiled in doping scandals since a 2015 report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics.
Its doping woes have grown since, with many of its athletes sidelined from the past two Olympics and the country stripped of its flag altogether at last year’s Pyeongchang Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Monday’s sanctions had been recommended by WADA’s compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year.
One of the conditions for the reinstatement of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data.
The sanctions effectively strip the agency of its accreditation.
Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory data to technical issues.
The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem for four years, as was the case during the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.
Some Russian officials, meanwhile, have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country.
If RUSADA appeals the sanctions endorsed by WADA’s executive committee, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA has said.

406,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/britain-faces-most-history-shaping-election-since-wwii/,"
LONDON: Britain is facing the most testing and significant period in its modern history since World War II.

The polarised electorate now has a critical choice to make — but it seems unlikely the result, whatever it may be, will heal deep and toxic divisions that could last a generation or more.
The 20th century saw Britain fight alongside and against Europeans and then help make the prosperous peace into the 21st century. This election will help determine where Britain’s formal relationship with the European Union lands and what the impact will be on all walks of life.
In 1945, after punishing years of war, Nazi bombardment, human sacrifice, and rationing, the voting populace shifted in huge numbers after Victory in Europe Day, casting aside wartime leader Winston Churchill for a Labour Party committed to economic rebuilding from the ashes of war.
In the nearly 75 years since, there have been other pivotal polling days — in 1964, 1979, 1997 and 2010 — and now the “Brexit election” serves up another inflection point that will shape the country’s future.
CHURCHILL SWEPT ASIDE IN 1945
Churchill epitomised Britain in its war years: The bulldog spirit and features and the iconic victory sign are still well-ingrained on the national psyche.
That didn’t count for much at the polls, though, in 1945 when a population weary from the German blitz and day-to-day suffering and shortages delivered the biggest election swing ever in Britain.
No elections had been held since 1935. Churchill’s Conservatives, who had presided over a national government during the war years, were unceremoniously dumped with a stunning nearly 11% election tilt to the Labour Party led by Clement Attlee.
It was a landslide triumph based on an economic program which had some similarities to US President Franklin D Roosevelt’s 1930s New Deal. In Britain, the National Health Service and welfare state came into being, full employment was sought and social reform was at the fore. This became the bedrock of the nation for decades until Margaret Thatcher’s rise in 1979.
LABOUR’S WILSON ENDS TORY RULE IN 1964
The Conservative government began to come off the rails as the 1960s dawned. They were beset by economic problems, the Profumo Affair, a sex scandal that had threatened national security, and an old guard establishment in charge that seemed out of touch with modernity.
Voters wanted to move on. Labour’s Harold Wilson, a pipe-smoking economist, made the then remarkable life journey from a northern town to 10 Downing Street. The year before his victory, Wilson had famously captured the now, in stark contrast to his opponents, with a speech extolling a new Britain that would need to be forged in the “white heat of a scientific revolution.”
London would swing later that decade. The Beatles were the country’s greatest export. But as viewers of “The Crown” TV series will know, Wilson had to dig Britain out of a deep economic hole and eventually devalue the pound when the deficit he had inherited from his predecessors became too crippling, He faced plots against his tenure both in the 1960s and during a second, briefer stint as prime minister in the mid-1970s.
THATCHER’S RADICAL RIGHT ASCENSION IN 1979
The “Winter of Discontent,” a period in the late 1970s that saw Britain steeped in a mire of nationwide strikes by potent public sector trade unions, paved the way for a radical right-wing government led by Margaret Thatcher. Her rule would upend and divide the country.
She was dubbed “Iron Lady.” The domineering right-wing press backed her to the hilt. Thatcher saw the unions as the “enemy within” and sought to destroy them.
She waged war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands, also known as Las Malvinas. She won both battles. But they came at a cost. When Britain sank an Argentinian ship, the Belgrano, which was sailing away from the area of conflict, hundreds of young conscripts were killed. One headline in a Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid crowed, “Gotcha!”
Parts of society benefited hugely under Thatcher during the 1980s. But unemployment and poverty rocketed, especially in the north of the country where long-established industries, like mining, were destroyed and with them their communities. A dominant and divisive Thatcher won three consecutive elections. She was felled in 1990 by her own party over her belligerent stance over ties with the EU — a fate that would befall her Tory successors as well.
There was no love lost between Thatcher and Ted Heath, prime minister from 1970-1974 after she had ousted him as Conservative leader. When she was deposed Heath was said to have exclaimed, “rejoice, rejoice, rejoice!”
BLAIR’S ‘NEW LABOUR’ TAKES POWER IN 1997
After 18 years of Conservative power, Tony Blair won over voters with a pledge of a fresh start: His “New Labour” would be a new incarnation of the party, no longer left-leaning as they had historically been, much more centrist and highly EU- and business-friendly.
At first Blair declared his priorities to be “education, education and education.” But military interventions followed on behalf of Kosovo against Serbia and in Sierra Leone in 1999/2000.
A much-hyped millennium night display that fizzled out seemed to capture the way the government was headed — style and spin over substance. With the Sept 11 attacks came Blair’s determination to “stand shoulder to shoulder” with the US. He duly followed President George W Bush into wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. London was then targeted in deadly terror attacks in 2005. Blair handed over the premiership after 10 years to Gordon Brown with an Iraq War-tainted legacy.
CAMERON’S COALITION EKES OUT WIN IN 2010
Brown’s three years at the helm were punctuated by the global financial crisis of 2008 and its fallout. He was a less charismatic leader than Blair and faced a young and energetic David Cameron on polling day.
Various Conservative leaders had painted themselves as one-nation Tories since the Thatcherite era ended. Cameron also attempted to cultivate a more compassionate Conservative approach than years previous.
A hung parliament ensued: Cameron cobbled together a coalition with the Liberal Democrats and harsh austerity years followed. Labour was out after 13 years, but the British political landscape would come to be dominated by a new word to enter the lexicon later the same decade: Brexit.

Activists sit after having barged into the building of Malta’s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s office, demanding his resignation in the wake of developments in case of the 2017 murder of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, in Valletta, Malta, December 9, 2019. Photo: Reuters
Muscat is not directly implicated in the investigation but has said he will resign in mid-January after an election for a new leader of his ruling Labour Party. Testimony by the self-confessed middleman in the murder plan has linked people in the prime minister’s inner circle to attempts at a cover-up.
About 40 activists surprised policemen and soldiers as they forced their way into the 16th century building in the capital Valletta from a side entrance, armed with drums, whistles, flags and loud hailers.
They then sat down and blocked the entrance, chanting for Muscat to quit. He was not in the building at the time.
The political stability of the tiny Mediterranean island has been rocked in recent weeks by the fallout from the murder of the anti-corruption journalist, who was blown up by a car bomb.
Muscat’s chief of staff Keith Schembri was named among those involved or having known about the plot. Schembri has resigned and is under investigation. He has denied any wrongdoing.
“Malta has reached rock bottom. This is not just about corruption, but about political murder,” the activists said over a loud hailer during their protest.
They said Muscat’s position was untenable and demanded a comprehensive investigation of all the people named, “not a cover-up”.
Police and soldiers watched over the activists who made no attempt to go upstairs, where the administrative offices are located.

UNITED NATIONS: A new generation of global inequalities fueled by climate change and technology could trigger violence and political instability if left unchecked, the United Nations warned on Monday.
Climate change and technology rather than wealth and income are the modern-day wedges that are increasingly dividing the haves from the have-nots, said the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in its 2019 Human Development Report.
These forms of inequality are rising as progress has been made in more traditional measures of inequality such as extreme poverty and disease, it said.
“Under the shadow of the climate crisis and sweeping technological change, inequalities in human development are taking new forms,” the report said.
“The climate crisis is already hitting the poorest hardest, while technological advances such as machine learning and artificial intelligence can leave behind entire groups of people, even countries.”
Allowing these new inequalities to grow could be “extremely dangerous and highly volatile,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.
“Across the rich and emerging countries and also developing countries where a middle class has emerged, their reactions are increasingly violent,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation ahead of the report’s release.
“If not managed well and practically, it will essentially manifest itself in what we see on the evening news – burning cars, burning buildings, burning infrastructure, millions of people in the streets protesting and overthrowing governments.”
Street protests have filled the news of late, in Hong Kong, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela and elsewhere over an array of issues including rising prices, government policies, corruption and pro-democracy movements.
The UNDP report said climate change will fuel inequality as it hits developing countries, many with limited capacity to resist threats from malnutrition, disease and heat stress.
“So the effects of climate change deepen existing social and economic fault lines,” it said.
As to technology’s effect on inequality, the report said the proportion of adults with university-level educations was growing more than six times faster in highly developed countries than in lower developed countries.
It also said fixed broadband subscriptions were growing 15 times faster in developed countries.
“These are the inequalities that will likely determine people’s ability to … function in a knowledge economy,” it said.
The changes come as many more people today no longer live in extreme poverty, Steiner said.
“Our aspirations have changed,” he said. “People are not just looking at the dollars in their account. They are looking at opportunities, at social mobility and at freedom of choice.”

409,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/mudslides-strand-hundreds-of-tourists-in-new-zealand-town/,"WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND: Nearly 1,000 tourists are stranded in the small New Zealand town of Franz Josef after stormy weekend weather triggered landslides and flooding along the town’s main highway.
Authorities said road access to the town likely won’t be restored until Friday.

Some of the tourists were choosing to leave by helicopter or small plane while others were waiting until the highway reopened.
Westland Mayor Bruce Smith said many of the 970 tourists in Franz Josef were taking the news in stride, but some were frustrated their travel plans had been disrupted.
He said there were about 20 planes and helicopters flying in and out of the town to help people leave. He said some tourists wanted to stay with their vehicles while others were trying to get confirmation their travel insurance would cover the extra costs of flying out.
“They all have the option of taking fixed wing planes or helicopters,” Smith said. “It’s just a question of who writes the check. I understand that.”
Smith said there would have been many more people stuck if the slips had occurred a few weeks later. He said the summer tourist season peaks in February when the town gets about 6,000 tourists traveling through each day.
Dan Burt, a spokesman for aviation tourist operator Inflite, said it had flown about 60 tourists from the town on Monday on two planes and two helicopters it had diverted to the area. He said it was charging them its normal rate of about 600 New Zealand dollars ($393) for the trip out.
Burt said many tour operators and rental car companies had been good about allowing people to leave their cars behind.
“They’ve said ‘Look you get out of there, and we’ll worry about vehicle later,” Burt said. “We’re trying to make sure people have a really good experience when they fly with us. We don’t want their last impression of New Zealand to be three days stuck in Franz Josef.”
Tourists typically visit the area to view the Franz Josef Glacier.
Stormy weather across New Zealand over the weekend caused disruptions and road closures in many parts of the country. Monday dawned fine and sunny in most of the country.

NEW DELHI: Police in New Delhi have arrested the owner and manager at a factory where 43 people perished in the Indian capital’s deadliest fire in 20 years, a spokesman said on Monday.
The blaze started early Sunday morning when more than a hundred workers were sleeping in the four-storey building located in a residential part of Delhi.

The factory, which made school bags and toys according to Indian media, was packed with combustible materials like paper, plastic and cardboard, causing it to burn for hours before being brought under control.
“We have arrested the owner and a manager of the factory where the fire broke out, and initiated an investigation which is going to be completed soon,” Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Delhi police spokesman, told Reuters.
Most workers employed at the unit used to live in the factory itself, cooking meals there. The Indian Express quoted one of the victims who had telephoned a neighbour in his hometown in central India saying he was trapped and going to die soon and that he should take care of his family.
Fire engines had struggled to access the congested lane where the building was located, witnesses said.
Frequent raids by civic authorities to enforce building codes, fire safety measures and evacuation procedures have failed to curb violations in the rapidly expanding city of around 20 million people.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced compensation of 1 million rupees ($13,933) for the families of those killed.
On Monday morning, more fire engines were dispatched to the factory to douse a small fire caused by burning waste.

One of New Zealand’s most active volcanoes spews ash plume
Many tourists among the affected, PM Ardern says
No current signs of escalation, agency GNS says

WELLINGTON: At least one person was killed, several injured and others reported missing in New Zealand after a volcano erupted off the east coast of its North Island on Monday, spewing a plume of ash thousands of feet into the air.
Twenty-three people, some of them believed to be tourists from the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship, were rescued from White Island, where the volcano erupted at about 2:11 pm (0111 GMT), police said.

Earlier, about 100 people were feared to have been nearby.
Michael Schade, an engineering manager from San Francisco, was one of the tourists who made it off the island minutes before the eruption.
He posted dramatic footage of the eruption from the boat he was on, with smoke first engulfing the top of the crater and then the entire island.
“This is so hard to believe,” Schade said. “Our whole tour group were literally standing at the edge of the main crater not 30 minutes before.”
The White Island is about 50 km (30 miles) from the east coast of North Island and huge plumes were visible from the mainland. Vulcanologists said the ash plume shot 12,000 feet into the air.
“We know that there were a number of tourists on or around the island at the time, both New Zealanders and visitors from overseas,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told a news conference.
“I know there will be a huge amount of concern and anxiety for those who had loved ones on or around the island at the time. I can assure them that the police are doing everything they can.”
Kevin O’Sullivan, chief executive of the New Zealand Cruise Association, said, “We believe there is a tour party from Ovation of the Seas involved in the White Island eruption. We have no further details at the moment.”
Ovation of the Seas is a 16-deck cruise ship owned by Royal Caribbean Cruises. It can take nearly 5,000 passengers and has a crew of about 1,500. It is docked at Tauranga, on the North Island, on a cruise that began in Sydney on Dec 3.
“We can confirm that a number of our guests were touring the island today,” a company representative said in an emailed statement. “We do not have any additional details to share at this time.”
At least one of those taken to shore was critically injured, police said, adding in a statement that a no-fly zone had been set up.
“I’m not sure if these people were on the island or near it, but there was definitely one group out there and they definitely needed medical care,” said Judy Turner, the mayor of the nearby coastal town of Whakatāne.
“There were some injuries and the focus is on getting these injured people back safely and to get them to a hospital.”
There seemed to be no danger for people in coastal areas farther away, she added.
The island’s immediate surroundings were hazardous because of the eruption, the National Emergency Management Agency said in a statement, adding that falling ash might affect some areas.
The “short-lived eruption” threw an ash plume about 12,000 ft (3,658 m) high, New Zealand’s geoscience agency GNS Science said in a statement but added there were no current signs of an escalation.
The White Island volcano is one of New Zealand’s most active.

412,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/saudi-gunman-tweeted-against-us-before-naval-base-shooting/,"PENSACOLA: The Saudi gunman who killed three people at the Pensacola naval base had apparently gone on Twitter shortly before the shooting to blast US support of Israel and accuse America of being anti-Muslim, a US official said Sunday as the FBI confirmed it is operating on the assumption the attack was an act of terrorism.
Investigators are also trying to establish whether the killer, 2nd Lieutenant Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, of the Royal Saudi Air Force, acted alone or was part of a larger plot.
Alshamrani, who was killed by a sheriff’s deputy during the rampage at a classroom building Friday, was undergoing flight training at Pensacola, where members of foreign militaries routinely receive instruction.
“We are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, work with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,” said Rachel J Rojas, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s office in Jacksonville.
Authorities believe the gunman made social media posts criticizing the US under a user handle similar to his name, but federal law enforcement officials are investigating whether he authored the words or just posted them, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Also, investigators believe the gunman visited New York City, including Rockefeller Center, days before the shooting and are working to determine the purpose of the trip, the official said.
All foreign students at the Pensacola base have been accounted for, no arrests have been made, and the community is under no immediate threat, Rojas said at a news conference. A Saudi commanding officer has ordered all students from the country to remain at one location at the base, authorities said.
“There are a number of Saudi students who are close to the shooter and continue to cooperate in this investigation,” Rojas said. “The Saudi government has pledged to fully cooperate with our investigation.”
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the investigation was proceeding under “the presumption that this was an act of terrorism”and he called for better vetting of foreigners allowed into the US for training on American bases.

Speaking at a news conference Sunday afternoon, DeSantis also said the gunman had a social media trail and a “deep-seated hatred of the United States.”
He said he thought such an attack could have been prevented with better vetting.
“You have to take precautions” to protect the nation, DeSantis said.
“To have this individual be able to take out three of our sailors, to me that’s unacceptable,” the governor added.
Earlier in the week of the shooting, Alshamrani hosted a dinner party where he and three others watched videos of mass shootings, another US official told the AP on Saturday.
Alshamrani used a Glock 9 mm weapon that had been purchased legally in Florida, Rojas said. DeSantis questioned whether foreigners should continue to be allowed under federal law to buy guns in the US and called it a “federal loophole.”
Republican DeSantis said he supports that the Second Amendment but that it “does not apply to Saudi Arabians.”
Family members and others identified the three dead  as Joshua Kaleb Watson, a 23-year-old graduate of the US Naval Academy; Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, of St Petersburg, Florida, who joined the Navy after graduating from high school last year; and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia.
The official who spoke Saturday said one of the three students who attended the dinner party hosted by the attacker recorded video outside the classroom building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, the official said.
In a statement, the FBI confirmed Sunday that it had obtained base surveillance videos as well as cellphone footage taken by a bystander outside the building, and had also interviewed that person.
Rojas would not directly answer when asked whether other students knew about the attack beforehand or whether there was anything “nefarious” about the making of the video. She said that a lot of information needs to be confirmed by investigators and that she did not want to contribute to “misinformation” circulating about the case.
Rojas said federal authorities are focused on questioning the gunman’s friends, classmates and other associates. “Our main goal is to confirm if he acted alone or was he part of a larger network,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, said on CBS’ “”Face the Nation” that the shooting looked like “terrorism or akin to terrorism.” But he cautioned that the FBI was still investigating.
“Look, to me it appears to be a terrorist attack,” he said. “I don’t want prejudge the investigation, but it appears that this may be someone that was radicalized.” O’Brien said he did not see evidence so far of a “broader plot.”
The US has long had a robust training program for Saudis, providing assistance in the US and in the kingdom. More than 850 Saudis are in the United States for various training activities. They are among more than 5,000 foreign students from 153 countries in the US going through military training.
Foreigners allowed into the US for military training are subject to background checks to weed out security risks.
“This has been done for many decades,” Trump said on Saturday. “I guess we’re going to have to look into the whole procedure. We’ll start that immediately.”
Saudi Arabia’s government so far has not commented on a possible motive for the shooting, nor offered any information about the promised investigation.

TOKYO: The body of a Japanese doctor killed in a roadside shooting in Afghanistan arrived back home Sunday, with government officials on hand to lead a brief ceremony of mourning at Tokyo’s Narita International Airport.
Tetsu Nakamura was killed last week, along with five Afghans who had been traveling with him.
Keisuke Suzuki, Japan’s state minister of foreign affairs, joined other officials in bowing their heads in prayer after laying flowers by the coffin, draped in white, in a solemn ceremony in honor of Nakamura at the airport.
Nakamura’s wife and daughter, who had flown to Afghanistan to bring the doctor’s body back, also took part in the ceremony.
Nakamura, 73, had worked in Afghanistan’s eastern Nangarhar province for over a decade, leading irrigation projects in rural areas. An outpouring of sadness has followed his killing, both in Afghanistan and in Japan.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who awarded Nakamura honorary Afghan citizenship in April, was among those who carried Nakamura’s coffin, covered in the Afghan flag, in a departure ceremony Saturday at Kabul’s airport.
The gunmen who killed Nakamura and the others fled the scene. Police say they are still looking for those behind the attack. The Taliban have denied any connection to the slaying.
Nakamura headed a charity based in Fukuoka, in southwestern Japan. His body will be flown there Monday, Japanese media reports said.

Protesters take to streets near heart of financial hub
Government urges calm and says it will “humbly listen”
Police arrest 11 people and seize array of weapons 

HONG KONG: Thousands of black-clad protesters from all walks of life thronged the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday in a sign of broad support for anti-government demonstrations that have roiled the Chinese-ruled city for six months.

With chants of, “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,” anti-government activists, young and old, marched from Victoria Park in the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay to Chater Road near the heart of the financial district.
Authorities gave the green light to Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) – organiser of largely peaceful million-strong marches in June – to hold the rally, the first time the group has been granted permission for a protest since August 18.
“I will fight for freedom until I die because I am a Hong Konger,” said June, a 40-year-old mother dressed in black seated on the grass in Victoria Park. “Today is about standing with Hong Kong, and the international community.”
The former British colony is governed under a “One Country, Two Systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not allowed in mainland China, but many fear Beijing is tightening the screws on the city and increasingly meddling in its affairs.
Beijing denies meddling, has condemned the unrest and blamed foreign governments, including the United States and former colonial power Britain, of interfering in the country’s internal affairs.
Echoes of “five demands, not one less” echoed through the streets, referring to protesters‘ calls for universal suffrage in choosing the city’s leader, among other demands.
Police said earlier on Sunday they had arrested 11 people, aged 20 to 63 and seized weapons including army knives, firecrackers, 105 bullets and a semi-automatic pistol, the first seizure of a handgun in six months of protests.
Roads that would normally be jammed with traffic on a Sunday near the heart of the city were empty, as a snaking crowd that included young families, students, professionals and the elderly clogged the streets of the Asian financial hub.
The violence in six months of demonstrations has escalated as protesters have torched vehicles and buildings, hurled petrol bombs at police, dropped debris from bridges onto traffic below and vandalised shopping malls, while police have responded with tear, gas, water cannon and, at times, live fire.
The large turnout on Sunday signalled still broad support for the anti-government demonstrations despite the escalating unrest in a city where violence is rare.
The protest comes two weeks after democratic candidates secured almost 90% of 452 district council seats in local elections that saw a record turnout, posing a fresh conundrum for Beijing and piling pressure on Hong Kong‘s leader Carrie Lam.
The protests intensified in June over a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, but have now evolved into broader calls for democracy, among other demands.
In a statement on Saturday, the government appealed for calm and said it has “learned its lesson and will humbly listen to and accept criticism.”
Hong Kong‘s new police commissioner, Chris Tang, said his force would take a flexible approach to demonstrations, using “both the hard and soft approach.”
The former British colony has been rocked by more than 900 demonstrations, processions and public meetings since June, with many ending in violent confrontations between protesters and police, who have responded at times with tear gas and rubber bullets.
Demonstrators are angry at what they perceive are more curbs on freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the then British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The chairman and president of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong were separately denied entry to the neighbouring Chinese-ruled city of Macau on Saturday after being detained by immigration officials.
Hong Kong has enjoyed relative calm since local elections on November 24 delivered an overwhelming victory to pro-democracy candidates.
Nearly 6,000 people have been arrested in the protests since June, more than 30% aged between 21 and 25.

STOCKHOLM: Fix the climate crisis and save the Earth, one of this year’s Nobel laureates for physics urged on Saturday, saying the idea of humans escaping our planet to live in other solar systems was farfetched and unrealistic.
Swiss astronomer Didier Queloz, who shared the 2019 Nobel Prize for Physics for discovering planets orbiting distant suns, said he had heard the argument against fighting climate change because ‘it doesn’t matter because anyway we’re going to leave the Earth at some point’.

“I think this is just irresponsible … because the stars are so far away, I think we should not really have any hope, serious hope, to escape the Earth,” Queloz said at a news conference in Stockholm where he is to collect his share of the 9-million-Swedish-crown ($910,000) prize next week.
“So we better spend our time and energy trying to fix it than trying to imagine that we will … destroy it and leave it,” he said.
Some scientists, including late cosmologist and theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, have said threats such as nuclear war and climate change are so serious humans may have to eventually leave the Earth in order to survive as a species.
Briton Stanley Whittingham, awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize for Chemistry along with American John Goodenough and Akira Yoshino of Japan for inventing the lithium-ion battery, said a pragmatic approach was needed to the climate crisis.
“We’ve got to do things step-wise and have some solutions in mind,” he said at the same event. “I think lithium batteries are going to help electrification of transportation, including big trucks, and in the U.S. it’s already helping solar and wind take over from coal power plants.”
The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created and funded in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901. This year’s award ceremony and banquet is on Dec. 10.

416,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/historical-documents-show-japans-role-in-wwii-sex-slaves/,"TOKYO: Japan’s army during World War II asked the government to provide one sex slave for every 70 soldiers, according to historical documents reviewed by Kyodo News service that highlight the state role in the so-called “comfort women” system.
The 23 documents were gathered by Japan’s Cabinet Secretariat between April 2017 and March 2019, including 13 classified dispatches from the Japanese consulates in China to the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo dating back to 1938, according to Kyodo.
The sex slaves issue has been a source of a painful dispute between South Korea and Japan. The women were from Korea, Taiwan and Australia, the Philippines as well as Japan.
In 1993, then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono, the government spokesman, apologized for the “comfort women” system and acknowledged the Japanese military’s involvement in taking women against their will.

The Kyodo reports shows one dispatch from the consul general of Jinan to the foreign minister that said the Japanese invasion had caused a surge in prostitution in the area, with 101 geisha from Japan, 110 comfort women from Japan, and 228 comfort women from Korea.
It says “at least 500 comfort women must be concentrated here by the end of April” for Japanese soldiers.
Presumably, the records imply that the women referred to as “geisha” might have come on their own, as opposed to sex slaves, who were coerced.
Another dispatch from the consul general of Qingdao in Shandong province in China says the Imperial Army asked for one woman to accommodate every 70 soldiers, while the navy had requested 150 more comfort women and geisha, Kyodo said.
The number of sex slaves is not certain, but historians say they numbered in the tens of thousands or more, and their purpose was to prevent the spread of disease and curtail rapes among soldiers.
Japan’s colonization and wartime record continue to strain relations with Asian neighbors. The Japanese government says reparations are settled but it has set up funds to support the victims. That has had mixed results with continued demands for a more thorough apology. Lawsuits are ongoing in South Korea.
Some have denied official Japanese involvement, and think the women were prostitutes who came of their own accord.
More recently, the sour relations between Japan and South Korea have affected trade and tourism and set off other controversies, including one earlier this year over the display of a statue depicting a young “comfort woman.”

Reported test comes ahead of year-end NKorean deadline
Sohae test site was partially dismantled then rebuilt
Analysts had noted activity at Sohae recently, suggesting test imminent

SEOUL: North Korea has carried out a “very important” test at its Sohae satellite launch site, state media KCNA reported on Sunday, a rocket testing ground that US officials once said Pyongyang had promised to close.
The reported test comes as a year-end deadline North Korea has imposed nears, warning it could take a “new path” amid stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States. The KCNA report called it a “successful test of great significance” on Saturday but did not specify what was tested.
South Korea’s defence ministry said South Korea and the United States are cooperating closely in monitoring activities at major North Korean sites including Tongchang-ri, the area where Sohae is located.
Missile experts said it appeared likely the North Koreans had conducted a static test of a rocket engine, rather than a missile launch, which are usually quickly detected by neighbouring South Korea and JapaN
“If it is indeed a static engine test for a new solid or liquid fuel missile, it is yet another loud signal that the door for diplomacy is quickly slamming, if it isn’t already,” said Vipin Narang, a nuclear affairs expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States.
“This could be a very credible signal of what might await the world after the New Year.”
Tensions have risen ahead of a year-end deadline set by North Korea, which has called on the United States to change its policy of insisting on Pyongyang’s unilateral denuclearisation and demanded relief from punishing sanctions.
On Saturday North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations said denuclearisation was now off the negotiating table with the United States and lengthy talks with Washington are not needed.
“The results of the recent important test will have an important effect on changing the strategic position of the DPRK once again in the near future,” KCNA reported, using the initials of North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
BUILDING UP TO A LAUNCH
The test is the latest in a string of statements and actions from North Korea designed to underscore the seriousness of its deadline.
North Korea has announced it would convene a rare gathering of top ruling-party officials later this month, and on Wednesday state media showed photos of leader Kim Jong Un taking a second symbolic horse ride on the country’s sacred Mt. Paektu.
Such meetings and propaganda blitzes often come ahead of major announcements from North Korean authorities.
While North Korea has not specified what its “new path” could be, observers have suggested the launch of a space satellite is a possibility, allowing Pyongyang to demonstrate and test its rocket capabilities without resorting to overt military provocation such as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch.
“Such testing is meant to improve military capabilities and to shore up domestic pride and legitimacy,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said of Saturday’s test.
“North Korea is avoiding violations of its long-range missile test moratorium for now, but it is still improving the propulsion and precision of its missiles so that it can claim a credible nuclear deterrent,” he said.
Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean Navy officer who teaches at Kyungnam University in Seoul, said North Korea may have tested a solid fuel rocket engine, which could allow North Korea to field ICBMs that are easier to hide and faster to deploy.
“North Korea has already entered the ‘new path’ that they talked about,” he said.
‘REVERSIBLE STEPS’
US President Donald Trump told reporters in June 2018 after his first summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that North Korea had pledged to dismantle one of its missile installations, which US officials later identified as Sohae.
Shortly after that summit, analysts said satellite imagery showed some key facilities at Sohae being dismantled.
However, in the wake of the second summit between Trump and Kim earlier this year, which ended with no agreement, new imagery indicated the North Koreans were rebuilding the site.
At the time Trump said he would be “be very disappointed” if the reports of rebuilding were true.
“Remember this is at the site that was supposedly dismantled as a ‘denuclearisation step,'” Narang said. “So this is a first step at ‘renuclearising.’ Reversible steps are being…reversed.”
In recent weeks, media reports indicated a high number of US military surveillance flights over the Korean peninsula, suggesting growing expectation of North Korean tests.
Commercial satellite imagery captured on Thursday by Planet Labs showed new activity at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station and the presence of a large shipping container, CNN reported, with analysts suggesting it indicated a test was imminent.

MUMBAI: At least forty-three people were killed in India’s capital New Delhi on Sunday when a fire swept through a six-storey factory where labourers were sleeping, government officials said.
The factory was making handbags and lots of raw material was stored inside the building due to which the fire spread quickly, local media reported. However, no details were immediately available on the cause of the fire.
“Till now we have rescued more than 50 people, most of them were affected due to smoke,” Atul Garg, an official with Delhi Fire Services told reporters.

Nearly 30 fire tenders were rushed to the spot and injured were admitted in four nearby hospitals, he said.
The factory was operating in a congested residential area.
“Have instructed concerned authorities to provide all possible assistance on urgent basis,” Amit Shah, India’s home minister, said in a tweet.
The fire was doused and a team of National Disaster Response Force was searching the factory to find out if any more people were trapped, a police official told Reuters.
The Delhi state government will conduct a probe and action will be taken against those responsible for the fire, Imran Hussain, minister of food and civil supplies, told reporters.

MEXICO CITY: Four people were killed and two injured in a shooting on Saturday near Mexico’s National Palace, the presidential residence in the capital’s historic downtown, officials said.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was traveling outside of Mexico City on Saturday.

Preliminary reports indicated an armed man entered a building on a small street near the palace looking to relieve himself, Mexico City police said.
After two people in the building reproached him, the man withdrew a pistol and opened fire. When police arrived, they found four people with gunshot wounds lying in the building’s courtyard, and shot at the gunman.
Paramedics found the gunman dead, along with two other people, the police said. One of three people who sustained injuries died en route to the hospital.
More than 100 police officers rapidly arrived and cordoned off the street, according to television images.
The building sits in a narrow, pedestrian-only street that opens onto an entrance of the National Palace used daily by government staff and reporters.
Lopez Obrador took office a year ago on pledges to run an austere government. In addition to cutting his salary by half, he shed various trappings of power, including a large force of secret-service style bodyguards.
The leftist also turned the luxurious Los Pinos presidential residence into a cultural center and moved into the centuries-old National Palace amid the bustle of Mexico City’s historic center.

Dr Kishore Singh said the victims were brought to the hospital by rescuers. Another 15 people were being treated for burns or smoke inhalation. They are in stable condition, Singh said.
The cause of the fire is being investigated.
Fire Services chief Atul Garg said the blaze was put out by 25 fire trucks and the rescue operation completed. He said that 56 people had been moved out of the area.
The fire broke out around 5:30 am.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the fire as “extremely horrific.”
“My thoughts are with those who lost their loved ones. Wishing the injured a quick recovery.,” Modi tweeted. Authorities are providing all possible assistance at the site of the tragedy, he said.
Fires are common in India, where building laws and safety norms are often flouted by builders and residents.
In 1997, a fire in a movie theater in New Delhi had killed 59 people. In February this year, 17 people were killed by a fire in a six-story hotel, also in the Indian capital that started in an unauthorized rooftop kitchen.

Suu Kyi was pictured smiling as she walked through the airport in the nation’s capital, Naypyitaw, flanked by officials, a day after thousands rallied in the city to support her and a prayer ceremony was held in her name.
Crowds are expected to gather again in the afternoon to send off several dozen supporters who will travel to The Hague in the Netherlands and demonstrations are planned throughout the coming week, with hearings set for December 10 to 12.
Gambia, a tiny, mainly Muslim West African country, filed a lawsuit in November accusing Buddhist-majority Myanmar of genocide, the most serious international crime, against its Rohingya Muslim minority.
During three days of hearings, it will ask the 16-member panel of UN judges at the International Criminal Court of Justice to impose “provisional measures” to protect the Rohingya before the case can be heard in full.

More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar in 2017 after a brutal military-led crackdown the UN has said was executed with “genocidal intent” and included mass killings and rape.
Despite international condemnation over the campaign, Suu Kyi, whose government has defended the campaign as a legitimate response to attacks by Rohingya militants, remains overwhelmingly popular at home.
On Saturday, thousands rallied in Naypyitaw while senior officials held a prayer ceremony at St Mary’s Cathedral in the former capital of Yangon.
Among them was religion minister Thura Aung Ko, who was been vocal in his disdain for the minority and last year said refugees in the camps in Bangladesh were being “brainwashed” into “marching” on Buddhist-majority Myanmar.
Suu Kyi spent the eve of her departure meeting with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, with both countries pledging stronger ties, according to Zhao Lijan, deputy director general of the information department at China’s foreign ministry.
“Aung San Suu Kyi thanked China for its strong support and help in safeguarding national sovereignty, opposing foreign interference, and promoting economic and social development,” he said on Twitter on Sunday.
Pro-Suu Kyi demonstrations have been held in major towns and cities since the news was announced that she would attend the hearings in person.
Billboards with her picture and the words “stand with Suu Kyi” have also been erected around the country, including in historic former capital Bagan, the country’s major attraction for tourists who come to see the centuries-old temples.

Chinese-American Xiyue Wang going back to the United States
Iranian Massoud Soleimani freed from US imprisonment
Switzerland facilitated the exchange
US-Iranian ties have worsened during Trump’s term

DUBAI: The United States and Iran swapped prisoners – a Chinese-American detained for three years on spying charges and an imprisoned Iranian – on Saturday in a rare act of cooperation between two longtime foes whose ties have worsened since President Donald Trump took office.
Trump said Chinese-American Xiyue Wang was returning to the United States. An Iranian official said that Iranian Massoud Soleimani had been freed from detention in the United States.
Switzerland facilitated the swap and Iranian state news agency IRNA said Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif welcomed Soleimani in Zurich, where it said the swap took place. It said Soleimani was expected to return to Iran in the coming hours.
In a statement issued by the White House, Trump made no mention of the freeing of Soleimani but thanked the Swiss government for its help in negotiating Wang’s release.
“Freeing Americans held captive is of vital importance to my Administration, and we will continue to work hard to bring home all our citizens wrongfully held captive overseas,” he said.
Zarif said earlier the prisoner swap was imminent. Later he posted pictures on Twitter of himself with Soleimani talking on board an Iranian plane.
“Glad that Professor Massoud Soleimani and Mr Xiyue Wang will be joining their families shortly. Many thanks to all engaged, particularly the Swiss government,” Zarif tweeted.
IRNA reported that Wang was released based on “Islamic clemency”.
Switzerland represents US diplomatic interests in Iran, since Washington and Tehran cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran.
A US official told the Associated Press that Brian Hook, the US special representative for Iran, accompanied Soleimani to Switzerland to make the exchange and Hook and Wang were now “en route to Landstuhl in Germany where Wang will be examined by doctors”.
It said Wang was expected to stay in Germany for several days. Landstuhl is home to an American military medical centre.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet that he was “pleased that the Iranian government has been constructive in this matter”. He added “we will not rest until we bring every American detained in Iran and around the world back home”.
‘THREE LONG YEARS’
Wang, a US citizen and Princeton University graduate student, was conducting dissertation research in Iran in 2016 when he was detained and accused by Iran of “spying under the cover of research,” an allegation his family and the university deny.
He was subsequently convicted on espionage charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2017.
Hua Qu, Wang’s wife, welcomed her husband’s release.
“Our family is complete once again. Our son Shaofan and I have waited three long years for this day and it’s hard to express in words how excited we are to be reunited with Xiyue,” she said in a statement.
“We are thankful to everyone who helped make this happen.”
Soleimani, a stem cell expert, was arrested at Chicago airport in October 2018 for allegedly attempting to export biological materials to Iran in violation of US sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme.
Washington has demanded that Iran release the Americans it is holding, including father and son Siamak and Baquer Namazi; Michael R White, a Navy veteran imprisoned last year, and Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent missing since 2007.
Several dozen Iranians are being held in US prisons, many of them for breaking sanctions.
Tensions have heightened between Iran and the United States since Trump last year pulled Washington out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Tehran’s economy.
In return, Iran has gradually scaled back its commitments to the agreement.

The vehicle belonging to the Medina Bus Company was attacked on a lonely stretch of road in the Kotulo area as it travelled between the towns of Wajir and Mandera.
“People, among them police officers, were brutally murdered,” Kenyatta’s office said in a statement.
Police said 10 people had been killed and that the attackers had specifically targeted non-Somalis after flagging down the bus. The area is mostly inhabited by ethnic Somali Kenyans.
“The attackers separated local Somalis from non-locals, and in the process, shot 10 non-locals dead,” police spokesman Charles Owino said in a statement.
He said security forces were pursuing the gunmen and that the driver and conductor of the bus were in custody and helping with investigations.
Al Shabaab said it had carried out the attack and that it had killed 10 people including “secret security agents and government employees”.
The Somali-based group has targeted Kenya many times since the East African nation sent troops across the border to fight the militants in their homeland in October 2011.

424,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/venice-tide-barriers-pass-another-test-but-skeptics-remain/,"VENICE: Floated along by barge, one of the 10-ton barriers designed to relieve Venice’s perennial flooding looks like a giant plaything: an oversized hinged yellow Lego.
Central to the plan to protect the city, some or all of the 78 barriers will one day be raised when the sea rises more than 110 centimetres (43 inches), to prevent damaging high tides from pushing into the lagoon city, a world heritage site built picturesquely — but somewhat precariously — upon more than 120 islands. Concerns that high tides are becoming more frequent because of climate change have increased the urgency.

While the concept is simple, its realization has been anything but.
The system of movable underwater barriers, dubbed Moses, has been beset by corruption, cost overruns and delays. Projected at 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) and meant to be completed by 2011, the project has so far cost 5.5 billion euros and is running a decade behind schedule.
In the wake of last month’s flooding of Venice, the worst in 53 years, the consortium that oversees construction of Moses is eager to demonstrate that the project — after years of bad news — is on track and will be fully operational by the end of 2021.
Venetians say they cannot afford to be wrong. Sceptics and critics say they may be.
A recent test of the deepest expanse of barriers — at the Malamocco entrance to the lagoon — was declared a success by the New Venice Consortium.
It was the last of the four sections of barriers to be completely raised — but so far only in calm seas. The real test will come when all four are raised at once, and not only in serene waters but under flood conditions. That isn’t scheduled to take place until the end of next year.
It took six years to test each of the four movable sea walls covering the three openings to the lagoon, partly because work was slowed by a 2014 corruption scandal that implicated the three main contractors and sent 35 people to jail.
Work is continuing largely with the original subcontractors now contracting directly with the consortium, which itself has been placed under government control as a result of the scandal.
The fact that the barriers have not yet been physically tested in rough seas is a concern to critics.
Paolo Vielmo, an offshore marine engineer who has long criticized the project, said that tests carried out in a laboratory in the Netherlands in the 1990s indicated that the barriers, under certain conditions, would oscillate out of control — possibly even breaking apart.
“Its behaviour is not predictable,” Vielmo said. He said that the trials so far declared successful have been under only modest sea conditions that fail to represent anywhere near the threat of the phenomenon of extreme oscillation called subharmonic resonance.
Vielmo and two other offshore engineers have compiled a report for the Codacons consumer and environment protection advocacy group, which is asking officials to run additional calculations to see if the project is indeed viable.
And if it is not, Codacons says Moses should be stopped.
“We don’t want to delay by one minute the possibility to make Moses operational. But we say we cannot make it operational until we are sure it will work,” said Franco Conte, president of Codacons in Venice. “Naturally, the Venetian community is exasperated and they say, ‘If we did 95%, let’s do 100% and see if that works.’ But that is unconscionable. If we don’t know if it works, we cannot experiment.”
The barrier system is made up of giant flood gates, each 20 meters (66 feet) long. The gates are attached by hinges to giant cement blocks placed on the seabed along the three openings from the sea into the lagoon, Malamocco, Chioggia and the Lido. The gates can be lifted to create a temporary barrier in high tides. Once the water has receded, they can be lowered again — allowing shipping traffic to continue and for the tidal system to flush out the lagoon.
The idea behind the project was to create a mobile system that would not impede views of the unique and protected landscape. But Moses has suffered criticism from the start that there were simpler, cheaper systems that could have been deployed.
Venetians have been waiting since the record 1.94-meter (6.36-foot) flood of 1966 for a system to protect them from regular inundations. The flooding in November, the second-worst recorded, proved the urgency.
In the 150 years that they have been recording the tide levels in Venice, two high tides above 1.5 meters have never been recorded in a year. In November, there were three in one week.
Climate scientists note that exceptional tides — those over 1.4 meters — have become much more frequent in the past two decades, with more than half of all recorded occurring since 2000.
“One has to realize the kind of existential question that that serious flooding has given rise to,” said Jane Da Mosto, an environmental scientist and executive director of the non-profit group We Are Here Venice, which is working to defend the city against myriad issues, including depopulation, cruise traffic through St. Mark’s basin and over-tourism. “People are asking: will Venice be defendable against these kinds of episodes?”
It’s not just the still-uncalculated damage to landmarks like St. Mark’s Basilica, where corrosive saltwater creeps through porous brick and tile. It’s also the boxes of ruined belongings and piles of soaked mattresses discarded in alleyways and loaded onto motorboats and trash barges for disposal. The relentlessness of the Venetian fall and winter tides make one-third of ground floors uninhabitable in the historic canal city.
“I am very old, I cannot say that I want to die, but I certainly do not want to be witness to the fact that it does not work,” 84-year-old resident Paola Scarpa said of the Moses barriers, as she walked to check on a family property in the Canareggio neighbourhood on a recent December morning. “It would be a pain too great.”

425,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/iraqi-officials-raise-fridays-toll-to-25-protesters-killed/,"BAGHDAD: Iraqi officials raised on Saturday the death toll to 25 protesters killed and over 130 wounded, after a bloody night of attacks by unknown gunmen that targeted anti-government demonstrators in the capital city.
The health and security officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

The attack on Friday was among the deadliest since Oct 1, when thousands of Iraqis took to the streets calling for sweeping political reforms and the end of Iran’s influence in Iraqi affairs. Security forces regularly use live rounds and tear gas to disperse the demonstrations, leading to heavy casualties.
The gunfire continued until the early hours of Saturday morning. The assailants first unleashed the deadly assault on Baghdad’s Khilani Square and Sinak Bridge, driving through the areas that are the epicentre of the popular uprising. Protesters said the electricity in the square was cut, creating chaos as they ran from the bullets and took cover in nearby mosques and streets.
The attack led to the burning of a car park that demonstrators had converted into a base for their sit-in while surrounding buildings in the square were pockmarked with bullet holes. On Saturday, protesters raised a bloodied white flag as they sought to return to the scene.
One protester was seen collecting the spent cartridges and held out at least a dozen.
Anti-government activists have sought to blame supporters of Iran-backed Iraqi militias, which have staged similar attacks against protester sit-ins in the capital and the country’s southern cities.
A string of mysterious knife attacks against anti-government protesters also occurred on Thursday in the square, after supporters of the Iran-backed militias attempted their own rival demonstration before withdrawing.
Friday’s deadly attacks came hours after Washington slapped sanctions on the head of Asaib al-Haq, a powerful Iran-backed militia accused of being behind deadly sniping attacks on protesters. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned leader Qais al-Khazali, his brother Laith al-Khazali, who is a commander in the group, and Husain Falih Aziz al-Lami.
Iraqi security forces were deployed to streets leading to the square by the early morning.
