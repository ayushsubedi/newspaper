FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

2,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

3,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

4,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

KATHMANDU: The government has set the target to garner more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors’ conference being organised on June 25 for the post-quake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
A study of losses caused by the devastating Gorkha Quake on April 25 and its aftershocks in various regions across the country shows that physical infrastructures worth Rs 512 billion were damaged by the quake and over Rs 666 billion was needed for reconstruction, rehabilitation and new construction.
The government is preparing to collect the assistance by presenting the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) report in the conference prepared by the National Planning Commission for the same.
According to the PDNA report, over Rs 399 billion is necessary for reconstruction and rehabilitation tasks in cultural heritage, education, health and human settlement sectors.
Similarly, Rs 117 billion is needed for reconstruction of agriculture, industry, irrigation and tourism sectors.
Likewise, the PDNA report estimates that it will cost Rs 74.26 billion for reconstruction of media, community infrastructures, hydropower, transport and drinking water and sanitation sectors while Rs 75.11 billion to recover the damaged gender, social security, nutrition, employment, environment and forest areas into previous position.

As per TAAN, 30 per cent of the amount collected from TIMS goes to TAAN’s organisational account, while 30 per cent goes towards NTB’s organisational account. Likewise, 30 per cent of the amount goes to the joint account of NTB and TAAN, while the remaining 10 per cent is deposited in the workers’ welfare fund.
The amount that TAAN is seeking from NTB is related to its share of money collected in the joint account of the organisations.
Distribution of TIMS card came into operation in 2008 to ensure the safety and security of trekkers and to control illegal trekking operations. Since then, TAAN has been issuing TIMS cards to group trekkers, while NTB distributes it to free individual trekkers.
As mentioned in the white paper, TAAN’s demand has not been addressed despite frequent discussions with the concerned authorities. The umbrella organisation of the trekking agencies in the country has also mentioned that several works have been affected as NTB has not released their share from the joint account.
The affected activities, as mentioned in the white paper, include search, rescue and medication of trekkers.
The white paper has mentioned that TAAN has not received its due share of the amount collected in the joint account since the last five years. “This has also adversely affected the administration expenses and wages of staffers working at the TIMS collection centre, along with the work of introducing and promoting new trekking routes,” reads the white paper.
Citing the security issues of trekkers, TAAN has been demanding the government to stop distributing trekking permits to individual trekkers.

Against the anticipation that the faulty Garima brand paddy which did not yield rice grains in the country’s western region would hit national paddy production this year, the preliminary paddy production report of the government has shown that the ‘Garima’ factor had less impact on the overall national production.
Though the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MoALD) is accumulating the paddy production data of this year from across the country, preliminary report has shown that production of the cereal crop has increased in other parts of the country beyond areas where Garima paddy had been planted thereby not altering the national production significantly, informed Ram Krishna Regmi, statistician at the ministry.
“Farmers who had planted Garima seeds had to bear losses and they will be compensated. However, as production of paddy in other parts of the country is seen to have increased, this will compensate the fall in production due to Garima ensuring that the national production is not affected significantly,” said Regmi.
As per MoALD, the paddy was planted in around 1,500 hectares of land in Chitwan, Rautahat, Nawalparasi, Nuwakot, Lamjung, Gorkha and Tanahu. Compared to other districts, paddy production in Chitwan was most affected.
Though Regmi was unwilling to disclose the national production of paddy this year citing that data are yet to be compiled, he informed that most of the provinces have witnessed paddy production above the target. “Especially, the use of hybrid paddy seeds in a majority of arable land has boosted productivity.”
The government has set paddy production target of almost six million tonnes for this year. Though the government is unlikely to meet this target, the production of paddy will be around last year’s production of 5.6 million tones, as per MoALD officials.
This year, paddy plantation has been carried out on 94.42 per cent of the total 1.37 million hectares of arable land used for paddy plantation across the country.
Paddy production alone has over 20 per cent contribution to the total agricultural production of Nepal, while agriculture sector has around 27 per cent contribution to national gross domestic product.

Emergency medical services took 11 people to the hospital, one of them suffering potentially serious injuries, Dr. John Gallagher, director of Sedgwick County EMS, told a news conference.
Company officials said two of victims went to the hospital in private cars and two were treated at the scene.
Injuries were limited because only a skeleton crew was on duty during the holidays, said Deputy Chief Daniel Wegner of the Sedgwick County Fire Department.
The explosion in a 3-inch liquid nitrogen gas line also damaged a storage tank, causing nitrogen gas to vent out of the building, Wegner said.
News video from the scene showed what appeared to be a steam cloud billowing out of the damaged building. The gas was not harmful, Wegner said.
A second valve also ruptured, said Kate Flavin, a spokeswoman for Sedgwick County, and emergency crews vented nitrogen gas from the affected tanks before doing another search of the plant.
No others were found injured and control of the facility was returned to Textron shortly after noon, but emergency crews remained on standby at the scene, she said.
Damage was contained to Plant 3, a site for composite manufacturing and experimental aircraft fabrication including that of the SkyCourier, said Stephanie Harder, a spokeswoman for Textron.
The SkyCourier, a utility turboprop under development, is due to enter service in 2020, Textron has previously said. Harder said it was too early to determine what damage the prototype aircraft under production may have suffered.
Textron Aviation, a unit of Textron Inc (TXT.N), makes Beechcraft and Cessna aircraft.
The Wichita-area economy has long been supported by aircraft manufacturing. Boeing Co (BA.N) announced in January it would suspend production of its 737 Max jetliner, which has been grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes. That move affected workers at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Boeing’s top supplier, which produces the jet’s fuselages.

The Patan High Court has prohibited any sort of protest activities inside banks.
Issuing an interim order today, the single bench of Justice Tek Narayan Kuwar today issued the order restricting protest activities in bank offices, especially by workers’ union, citing that banking is an essential service.
The order states that protest inside banks is against the Essential Service Operation Act 2014, which has kept banking sector as a sector that provides essential service to the public.

“Banking sector comes under essential service provider. Thus, no one should organise activities that directly affect operation of a bank and its service,” reads the interim order.
Earlier, Upendra Bahadur Karki from Nadep Laghubitta Bittiya Sanstha had filed a case against such activities organised by banking staffers and workers’ union in banks and financial institutions.
Following today’s hearing on the case, the Patan High Court has also summoned both parties — the writ petitioner and trade unions — for discussion.

Hydropower developers are still waiting to sign the power purchase agreement (PPA) with Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) for 200 hydropower projects with total installed capacity of 6,000 megawatts of electricity. And a majority of these projects are being developed by independent power producers.
According to NEA, there are some practical issues related to the Nepal Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) regarding the determination of the theoretical basis to ink PPA with developers.

Prabal Adhikari, spokesperson for NEA, said as per guidelines of NERC, power developers need to complete survey, prepare environment and social impact report, obtain power generation licence, submit technical and financial aspects of their power projects and the tentative rates, among others before the PPA can be signed.
Earlier, the power utility could independently negotiate and determine the power purchase rates with the developers.
As per Article 13 (c) of NERC Act, parties that are involved in the sale and purchase of electricity can set the price per unit of power only after receiving permission from NERC. However, PPA guidelines of NEA do not have this provision.
“Since there is confusion regarding this issue in between NERC’s and NEA’s guidelines, we cannot take any decision regarding PPA unless NEA board gives a concrete answer on the issue,” informed Adhikari.
As per Dilli Bahadur Singh, chairman of NERC, NEA and other stakeholders need to follow the guidelines that the commission has prepared. “The PPA signing procedure has not been halted due to us. If the concerned parties forward their agreements to us, we will assess the proposals and take the needful decision,” he stated.
According to Singh, the commission will determine some of the provisions for approving the power purchase and sale rates, tentative investment, ratio of equity and loan, source of the loans and interests, clearance of loans and interests, returns on investment, recurrent expenditure, operational expenditure, maintenance costs, revenue and tax and other service charges, additional capital that will be required, among others.
“The concerned stakeholders need to prepare the aforesaid documents and meet the criteria as per the requirement of the commission,” Singh clarified.
Shailendra Guragain, president of Independent Power Producers Association Nepal, said the government agencies are intentionally delaying the PPA signing process with the power developers.
“The government must establish a ‘one desk’ system to perform all activities before execution of any hydropower project. At present, concerned government agencies have been playing blame game and ultimately we have to face the unnecessary consequences,” he said, adding, the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation must play a more constructive role to break the deadlock regarding all the problems that power developers have been facing since long.
Till a few months back, power producers needed to only approach NEA to sign PPA. But, after formation of NERC, state-owned power utility needs to get the PPA approved from NERC before inking final PPA with the developers.

Eighty-six per cent of private houses that were damaged by the devastating earthquakes in 2015 have been reconstructed in the four years after the establishment of the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) — the consortium of post-earthquake reconstruction process.
The figure, however, also includes houses whose reconstruction is under way.
Amid a programme organised to mark the four years of NRA’s establishment, the authority informed that the reconstruction of 482,323 private houses out of 780,165 households with which NRA had inked the housing grant has been completed so far. Similarly, 189,041 quake-damaged houses are currently being rebuilt.
As per NRA’s statistics, 5,380 or 71 per cent of 7,553 educational institutions affected by the earthquakes have been reconstructed till date. Similarly, reconstruction works of 1,787 institutions is currently ongoing.

Similarly, of the 891 cultural heritage sites of 32 districts damaged by the earthquakes, the reconstruction of 387 sites has been completed, while reconstruction of 123 such sites is ongoing, as per NRA.
Of the 1,197 health institutions affected by the quakes, reconstruction of 665 has been completed, while reconstruction of 149 such institutions is ongoing.
On the occasion, NRA Chief Executive Officer Sushil Gyewali informed that the reconstruction drive is smooth and has made significant progress in recent months. As per him, Rs 335 billion has been invested in the reconstruction works so far.
However, Gyewali outlined a few challenges as the reconstruction process moves ahead, including resource management.
“The reconstruction work still has huge budget deficit. Along with this, challenges also lie in rebuilding of private houses in city areas and collecting the housing grant back from fake beneficiaries,” he said.
As per him, NRA still has a deficit of Rs 300 billion to complete the entire reconstruction works, while the authority requires Rs 34 billion within this fiscal. “The government and other stakeholders should discuss ways to assure necessary budget for reconstruction and ensure that the post-quake reconstruction works move forward smoothly.”

The government is preparing to tighten the process through which people can procure driving licences by making both the written and trial examinations stricter for large as well as small vehicles.
Gogan Bahadur Hamal, director general at the Department of Transport Management (DoTM), informed that they are preparing the draft of the act that will govern the entire transportation sector to address the federal structure of the country.
“We have plans to complete the drafting process soon and get the final act endorsed through the ongoing session of the Federal Parliament,” he added. “We have proposed to change the examination method to avail licence to operate larger vehicles in the Federal Vehicles and Transport Act.”
According to Hamal, the number of fatal accidents involving public transport has been rising every passing year.
He informed that as per a study conducted by DoTM, 80 per cent of the road accidents occur due to the negligence of the drivers. “The remaining 20 per cent includes human error, mechanical faults, bad road conditions and careless pedestrians.
Hence, our major goal is to amend the licence test by targeting drivers,” he stated.

“We are planning to introduce a three-month formal course for licence aspirants, which will include subjects related to the mechanical condition of vehicles, overall condition of vehicles and also the way that drivers behave with passengers, among others,” Hamal added.
He informed that once the act is endorsed, vehicle licence aspirants will have to undertake the three-month formal course before they are eligible to attend the driving trial examination.
After passing the written test, aspirants will then be allowed to sit for the experimental trail test, which will be totally different from the present examination system.
“Licence-seekers will have to go through field trials before they can obtain a ‘temporary’ licence, which means that aspirants will be examined on how they drive in real conditions,”
Hamal said, adding that if they fail the examination, they will be given a chance for one more time only.
According to him, after passing the field test, there will be a further six-month trial period before the aspirant can actually obtain a ‘permanent’ licence.
Likewise, the new age limit in the proposed act is 18 years for two-wheelers and 25 years for four-wheelers.
“We will also be raising traffic fines through the federal law. Due to the rising incidents of traffic violations, we have proposed to increase the traffic violation fines by three folds from what they are at present,” said Hamal. “We believe that once the fines have been increased substantially, the number of road accidents will also decline.”
The act will also address the concerns of ride-sharing services and will clearly define whether it will be legal or not to transport passengers on vehicles registered for private use.
As per Hamal, the DoTM will hold discussions on the proposed act with the chief ministers of all the seven provinces on December 29 and 30.
At present, passenger vehicles have to operate in areas that lack basic road infrastructure which has been blamed for many accidents that have taken place in the recent past.
“We will discuss this issue with the chief ministers for a possible way out and take suggestions for reducing accidents, especially in hilly and mountainous regions,” Hamal said.

The government has remained a mute spectator to recent incidents in the poultry industry that involved a 10-day campaign of hatcheries destroying six million chicks and poultry entrepreneurs arbitrarily hiking the price of chicken and eggs in the domestic market.
Citing the growing loss amid surplus production, hatcheries across the country stopped production of chicks for 10 days till Tuesday. Two days later, poultry entrepreneurs raised chicken price by Rs 15 per kg to Rs 285 a kg. With this, chicken price has been raised by Rs 35 per kg over a one-week period. Similarly, price of eggs has been raised by Rs 15 per case to Rs 290 with effect from today.
In a bid to pressure the government to raise the price of chicks, hatcheries across the country stopped producing chicks for 10 days and apparently destroyed eggs that were ready to hatch. As entrepreneurs involved in the hatchery business claim that the country produces almost four million chicks every week, they believe that almost six million chicks were destroyed from hatching in the 10-day strike that started on December 14.
As those involved in hatchery business and poultry are almost the same entrepreneurs, they first destroyed the soon-to-hatch eggs and then raised prices of both chicken and eggs in the market, while the government remained a mere spectator.
As Nepal is self-sustaining in chicken and does not import the produce, a few big poultry entrepreneurs are trying to leverage their influence and create a monopoly in the market through support from a few government officials, charges consumer rights activist Jyoti Baniya.
“Poultry and hatchery entrepreneurs destroying their own assets in the name of growing loss was to create more assets,” said Baniya, adding that the government’s failure to intervene in such unlawful activities will make the market unhealthy and hit consumers badly.
However, hatchery entrepreneurs defend their move, saying they were compelled to destroy chicks as they had to incur huge loss following surplus production in recent months. “The country produces over four million chicks every week, while its demand is less than three million per week. While the production cost of one chick is almost Rs 50, the market price is almost Rs 20,” argued Rishi Ram Poudel, central senior vice-president of Nepal Hatchery Industry Association, adding that the government should allow new hatchery firms based on market demand and fix chick production quota for each hatchery.
There are more than 200 hatcheries in Nepal and over 120 are based in Chitwan district alone.
However, government officials ‘shamelessly’ say that it was the right of poultry and hatchery entrepreneurs to destroy their assets. “Though we knew about hatcheries destroying chicks, we could do nothing as they had the right to their property. We can intervene only if their activities affect price of chicken and eggs in the market, which it has now,” said Banshi Sharma, director general at the Department of Livestock Service, adding that the department will coordinate with other government agencies and start monitoring the market from tomorrow.
“All those involved in raising prices arbitrarily will be booked,” he added.
Meanwhile, Pradeep Chandra Bhattarai, deputy spokesperson at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, said the government would initiate action as poultry and hatchery entrepreneurs could not raise prices without valid scientific reason. “They have incurred loss due to unhealthy competition that they practised on their own. This should not affect prices of chicken and eggs,” he said.

While the government is busy with preparations for the campaign, CAAN staffers have threatened to stop working if the government does not withdraw its decision of splitting the authority into two separate organisations.
Organising a press meet here today, Sravan Kumar Yadav, president of the union, informed that they had urged the concerned authorities not to divide CAAN. However, their request has remained unheard, he added.
“The then aviation department was turned into CAAN on December 31, 1998. Since then, CAAN has been fulfilling its responsibilities as an operator and regulator of the country’s aviation sector,” he said.
“And in the coming days as well CAAN can carry out its responsibilities with accountability and transparency.”
He further claimed that the CAAN has now also become financially stable and is progressing in other sectors as well.
“In such a situation, there is no need of dividing CAAN into two separate organisations,” he added.

The union has also claimed that efforts are being made against the progress of CAAN. “As the Gautam Buddha International Airport and Pokhara Regional International Airport are all set to begin operation of international flights, some groups want to privatise these projects while CAAN has been fulfilling its duties diligently.”
The union has also accused European Union of trying to rule Nepali’s aviation sector, ‘which is why it has put Nepal in its air safety list citing the role of CAAN’.
The union has announced that it is boycotting CAAN’s anniversary event on December 31. The union has also threatened pen down strike and that the workers will wear black armbands while on duty as a sign of protest.

The insurance bill has been stalled at the Federal Parliament’s Finance Committee since one-and-a-half years as the Ministry of Finance and the committee have been unable to conclude the related discussions.
On July 22 last year, Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada had tabled the ‘Bill for amendment and integration of insurance’ at the Parliament. The bill has envisioned reorganising the current structure of board of directors at insurance companies after its endorsement from the Parliament.
Krishna Prasad Dahal, chairman of the finance committee, said that they will soon hold a discussion on the bill. “Till date the bill has been discussed two or three times, but we were unable to come to any conclusion.”
Dahal further informed that the bill had not been endorsed yet as the ministry had not given enough time for the discussion.
“The discussion is bound to be lengthy as we need to get into all the details. While we are hoping to sit for a discussion within the next five days, all depends on the finance ministry.”
According to Dahal, the issue has been lingering as both the parties have been unable to come together for the discussion. “We have been unable to find a mutually convenient time for the discussion,” he said, while emphasising that both sides were, however, serious about getting the bill endorsed at the earliest.
“I believe that the bill will move forward during this winter season of the Parliament,” he said.

The insurance sector regulator — Insurance Board — had proposed that it be given more autonomy and hence more authority.
However, the ministry has reportedly changed the provision of the initial draft bill submitted by the Insurance Board and reduced the authority of the regulatory body.
“The Finance Ministry has tried to keep the insurance sector regulator as a division under its authority,” a source at the board informed, further claiming that the ministry is intentionally delaying the process of bill’s endorsement.
When he was appointed to the helm of Insurance Board, Chiranjeevi Chapagain had stressed on the need for timely amendment of the Insurance Act.
But should the proposed bill be endorsed, Chapagain could lose his job.
This is because if the Parliament endorses the bill in its current form, the Insurance Board will be dissolved and Insurance Authority will be set up in its place as the sector regulator.

Sushil Gyewali, chief executive officer of NRA, who inspected the ongoing reconstruction process of the historical monument on Tuesday, applauded the progress achieved in reconstruction of Dharahara and encouraged the developer to complete the project within stipulated timeframe.
Reconstruction of Dharahara, which collapsed in the 2015 earthquake, had begun after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in December last year laid the foundation stone for the 18th century monument. Dharahara is being reconstructed at an estimated cost of Rs 3.48 billion, of which Rs 750 million has already been invested so far, as per NRA.

22,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/nrb-directs-himalayan-bank-to-elect-directors-based-on-proportion-of-shares/,"Kathmandu, December 25
Himalayan Bank Ltd (HBL) will now have to ensure that its board directors representing institutional shareholders are elected on the basis of proportion of shares they hold in the financial institution.
Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank and the banking sector regulator, has given 30 days’ time to the bank to make this change.
NRB has issued a directive saying the bank should hold election of board directors within 30 days so that institutional shareholders, who hold largest number of shares, can send their representatives to the board.
This directive, seen by The Himalayan Times, was issued by NRB’s Bank Supervision Department on Monday.

The latest central bank decision is expected to pave the way for a representative of Mutual Trading to enter the boardroom, as it is fourth largest institutional shareholder in the bank with 11.85 per cent stake.
Mutual Trading is solely owned by Prem Lata Khetan, wife of late Mohan Gopal Khetan and mother of Rajendra and CP (Chandra Prakash) Khetan. PP (Prem Prakash) Khetan — son of late Hari Gopal Khetan, who is brother of late Mohan Gopal Khetan — used to represent Mutual Trading in the bank’s board till 2012. He stepped down that year following differences with other board members, according to sources.
Mutual Trading had made an attempt to resend its representative to HBL’s board few years ago, but its request was denied by Board Chairman Manoj Bahadur Shrestha, sources said. The firm then moved the Patan High Court in November 2017 accusing HBL’s chairman and CEO of preventing it from sending a representative to the boardroom. The court, in its first verdict, told the firm to wait until existing board directors completed their four-year term this fiscal year. The firm has since appealed to the court to review its decision, but no verdict has been issued so far.
The Banks and Financial Institutions Act and a central bank directive clearly say board members, who represent institutional shareholders, should be elected in proportion to shares held by investors. If this provision is enforced in line with the latest central bank directive, the representative of Chhaya International will have to exit the boardroom.
Himalayan Bank has six major institutional shareholders, with Habib Bank of Pakistan holding 20 per cent stake, followed by Employees Provident Fund (14 per cent), N Trading (12.71 per cent), Mutual Trading (11.85 per cent), Ava International (11.38 per cent) and Chhaya International (8.89 per cent). Except for Mutual Trading, all other institutional shareholders have sent their representatives to the bank’s board.
It is impossible to make room for representatives of all six major institutional shareholders of the bank in the board because of a provision in the Banks and Financial Institutions Act enforced in 2017. This law allows banks to have up to seven members in the board, including the chairman, but two seats must be reserved for an independent director and a director who represents public shareholders.
This means institutional shareholders can only send a maximum of five persons to the board.
This provision, coupled with the latest NRB instruction, means Chhaya International, which has the lowest number of shares among six major institutional shareholders must quit the board. Chhaya International is represented by Prachanda B Shrestha in the board. Prachanda did not receive THT’s call and neither did he respond to a text message.
Prachanda, and Manoj, the chairman of Himalayan Bank since 2004, are siblings.
Multiple sources told THT that both the brothers have tightened their grip on the bank over the years, which, they said, have not always produced good results.
“We are about to lose an opportunity to bring in a new foreign investor in the bank because of the delay made by the chairman in making disclosures as requested by the foreign group,” a source said referring to the interest shown by CDC Group, a development finance institution owned by the UK government, to purchase 20 per cent stake of Habib Bank in the Himalayan Bank. Habib has already made the decision to offload its stake in the bank. “But we are not sure whether we can rope in CDC because of the chairman’s imprudence. This has raised the eyebrows of top central bank officials as well.”
Many are now viewing the central bank’s latest directive as a move to break the stronghold of Shrestha brothers in the bank’s board.
“We want banks to bring in reputed foreign investors so that there is healthy competition in the market and transfer of knowledge and skills, which will benefit the entire economy,” a central bank official told THT on condition of anonymity.

Bankers have expressed their reservations against the recent move of Nepal Rastra Bank to tighten lending standards for auto and personal home loans.
Stating that the NRB’s move — which requires banks and financial institutions to maintain the debt service to gross income ratio on personal loans, housing loans and hire purchase loans at 50 per cent — will directly hit loan demand and disbursement, bankers have asked the central bank to revoke its direction.
Issuing a circular yesterday, NRB had barred BFIs from floating personal, housing and hire-purchase loans amounting to more than half the income of the borrower. The circular has also made it mandatory for BFIs to seek income certificates and tax clearance certificates from the borrowers of such loans.
“As BFIs have their own policy on issuing loans, implementation of such provision will directly affect loan disbursement from BFIs,” said Bhuwan Dahal, chief executive officer of Sanima Bank, adding that bankers will discuss the issue with the central bank.
Gyanendra Dhungana, president of Nepal Bankers’ Association — the umbrella organisation of 28 commercial banks — said the NRB’s recent direction was impractical, especially the provision which sought tax clearance certificate from borrowers.
“Borrowers rarely come up with tax clearance certificate of their income. It is not possible for borrowers to submit tax clearance certificate of money they have acquired through remittance or house rent,” said Dhungana.
Meanwhile, NBA is also preparing to send an official letter to the central bank asking it to make amendments to the recent circular.

The Finance Committee under the Federal Parliament has urged stock market investors to submit their suggestions in writing for implementation of a 58-point suggestion made by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) for capital market reforms.
In this regard, Finance Committee had summoned representatives of share investors’ associations today and held a discussion on the best way to implement the suggestions made by central bank.
Uttam Aryal, chairperson of Investors’ Association of Nepal, had led the discussion from the investors’ point of view. Hence, the committee has tasked him to submit the suggestions of the investors in writing.
During the discussion today, various representatives of the investors opined that the government should issue broker licences to banks.

As per Aryal, investors also asked concerned authorities to take an initiative to reduce the interest rate of banks. Investors demanded that the 58-point suggestion be implemented without further adieu for improvement of the stock market.
In December 2018, the Ministry of Finance had formed a task force under the then deputy governor of Nepal Rastra Bank Shivraj Shrestha to look into the problems facing the share market. The task force was formed after share investors had launched protests protesting unfavourable government policies, extremely high bank interest rates, among other issues.
Although some suggestions of the task force have been implemented by the government, the stock market has not improved significantly. The government has already set up the settlement guarantee fund and changed Nepse’s software.
The suggestions that are yet to be implemented include resolving the capital gains tax dispute, enhancing margin trading, etcetera.
Earlier, it was decided that the Citizen Investment Trust would be designated as market dealer, but lack of necessary preparations by the Securities Board of Nepal has halted the process.
Today’s delegation of share investors also included Tulsi Dhakal on behalf of Nepal Investors Forum and Radha Pokharel on behalf of Nepal Pujibazar Laganikarta Sangh, among others.

The Department of Commerce, Supply and Consumer Protection (DoCSCP) has requested stakeholders to provide suggestions for revision of its monitoring policy.
Issuing a notice today, the department has implored industrialists, traders, exporters, importers, consumers and other governmental and non-governmental authorities related to the department to submit their suggestions within 15 days.
The department has urged the stakeholders to provide their review of the existing monitoring practices of the department along with recommendations to improve its policies and rules.
“Aiming to intensify the market monitoring and to regulate the market for protection of consumers’ rights, the department is seeking feedback and suggestions from the stakeholders,” the notice reads.
After collecting recommendations, the department will evaluate the suggestions and implement practical recommendations while revising its monitoring policy.
Currently, the department is conducting monitoring on a daily basis and further intensifies its inspection during the festive seasons. However, the department has faced immense criticism for not conducting its monitoring properly.
Meanwhile, former director general of the department, Yogendra Gauchan, said that the government market monitoring outside the valley has not been as effective as desired due to lack of human resources. The department has been saying that there is a lack of technical human resources in the market for monitoring activities. The government has faced difficulties in deploying technicians in the lack of skilled manpower, especially in the rural areas, even as the department conducts daily monitoring within the valley.
Amidst this, the department has decentralised the responsibility of market monitoring to the local governments from this year. Starting with the festive season of this year, the local governments have also started conducting market inspections.

Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality of Solukhumbu district has topped the chart of natural resource royalty earners at the local level, generating Rs 115 million in income in the last fiscal from the use of mountains, rivers, forests and mines.
Next in the league table of top natural resource royalty earners is Tamakoshi Rural Municipality of Dolakha district (Rs 88.9 million), followed by Gokulganga Rural Municipality of Ramechhap district (Rs 78.7 million), Bidur Municipality of Nuwakot district (Rs 35.5 million) and Bhotekoshi Rural Municipality of Sindhupalchowk district (Rs 33 million).

This is the first time the federal government has distributed royalty collected from use of four natural resources — mountains, rivers, forests and mines — at the local level. The royalty generated in the last fiscal was disbursed last week.
Of the 753 local units across the country, 576 local governments, or 76.5 per cent, had received royalty from use of natural resources. The federal government had distributed Rs 1.4 billion in royalty among these local governments.
The federal government distributes 25 per cent of the total royalty generated from the use of natural resources at the local level and another 25 per cent among seven provinces. It keeps 50 per cent of such royalty.
As per this formula, seven provinces received Rs 1.4 billion in royalty, with Province 3 becoming the highest revenue earner (Rs 531.1 million), followed by Gandaki (Rs 285.9 million) and Lumbini (Rs 250.9 million).
The federal government retained Rs 2.9 billion in royalty collected from use of natural resources.
A big chunk of royalty was collected from the use of rivers, which house quite a number of hydropower projects.
Nepal generated Rs 748.7 million, or 52.3 per cent of the total royalty, from the use of rivers. Forests made a contribution of Rs 390.6 million to the government’s royalty, followed by mines (Rs 154.5 million) and mountains (Rs 138.4 million).
Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, which emerged as top royalty earner, generated Rs 82.9 million from use of mountains and Rs 32.1 million from use of forests. This rural municipality is home to the world’s tallest peak, Mt Everest, as well as Mt Lhotse, Mt Cho Oyu, Mt Ama Dablam and Mt Nuptse. Each foreign mountaineer must fork out $11,000 in expedition royalty to climb Mt Everest.
The federal government was supposed to distribute royalty a month after the end of the fiscal, in mid-August. But it was delayed due to confusion in formula developed to distribute the royalty.
Nim Dorje Sherpa, chairman of Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, said, “We should have received the royalty money from fiscal 2017-18 onwards, but the central government citing mismanagement of paperwork for its inability to do so,” he said.
Bhesh Prasad Bhurtel, deputy financial comptroller general of Financial Comptroller General Office, said they were able to distribute royalty only after detailed meeting with different government agencies since last one-and-a-half years.
Earlier, government agencies related to mountains, rivers, forests and mines had submitted a bulk figure of royalties collected, so the FCGO faced problems in segregating the royalty amount they had actually generated, he explained.

30,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/san-francisco-cafes-are-banishing-disposable-coffee-cups/,"SAN FRANCISCO: A new cafe culture is brewing in the San Francisco area, where a growing number of coffee houses are banishing paper to-go cups and replacing them with everything from glass jars to rental mugs and BYO cup policies.
What started as a small trend among neighborhood cafes to reduce waste is gaining support from some big names in the city’s food and coffee world.
Celebrated chef Dominique Crenn, owner of the three-star Michelin restaurant Atelier Crenn, is opening a San Francisco cafe next year that will have no to-go bags or disposable coffee cups and will use no plastic. Customers who plan to sip and go at Boutique Crenn will be encouraged to bring their own coffee cups, says spokeswoman Kate Bittman.

On a bigger scale, the Blue Bottle coffeehouse chain, which goes through about 15,000 to-go cups a month at its 70 US locations, says it wants to “show our guests and the world that we can eliminate disposable cups.”
Blue Bottle is starting small with plans to stop using paper cups at two of its San Francisco area branches in 2020, as part of a pledge to go “zero waste” by the end of next year. Coffee to-go customers will have to bring their own mug or pay a deposit for a reusable cup, which they can keep or return for a refund. The deposit fee will likely be between $3 and $5, the company said.
Blue Bottle’s pilot program will help guide the company on how to expand the idea nationwide, CEO Bryan Meehan said in a statement.
“We expect to lose some business,” he said. “We know some of our guests won’t like it — and we’re prepared for that.”
Larger coffee and fast-food chains around the US are feeling a sense of urgency to be more environmentally friendly, and will no doubt be watching, said Bridget Croke, of New York-based recycling investment firm Closed Loop Partners, which is working with Starbucks and McDonald’s to develop an eco-friendly alternative to the disposable coffee cup.
Despite the name, today’s conventional paper cups for hot drinks aren’t made solely from paper. They also have plastic linings that prevent leakage but make them hard to recycle, Croke said. She says it’s unlikely large national chains will banish disposable cups, in the immediate term, or persuade all customers to bring mugs, so they’re looking for other solutions.
Starbucks and McDonald’s chipped in $10 million to a partnership with Closed Loop to develop the “single-use cup of the future” that is recyclable and compostable.
“They know there are business risks to not solving these problems. And the cup is the tip of the spear for them,” said Croke, adding that Blue Bottle’s choice of San Francisco for its test run is clearly the right market.
Starbucks, which has more than 15,000 US cafes and about 16,000 internationally, plans to test newly designed recyclable cups in five cities next year: San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Vancouver and London, spokeswoman Noelle Novoa said.
California cities have long been leaders in recycling and passing laws to encourage eco-friendly habits.
This year, the state became the first to ban restaurants from automatically handing out plastic straws with drinks. It was also the first, in 2014, to prohibit stores from providing disposable plastic grocery bags to shoppers, and bags at checkout now cost 10 cents.
Also this year, San Francisco International Airport became the nation’s first major airport to stop selling water in plastic bottles. Water is now sold in glass bottles and aluminum cans, and travelers are encouraged to bring their own empty bottles to fill up for free.
Starting in January, cafes and restaurants in Berkeley will charge 25 cents for disposable cups, and San Francisco is considering similar legislation.
Anticipating the fee, a group of about a dozen Berkeley cafes teamed up in a mug-sharing program, where customers can rent a stainless steel cup from one cafe and drop it off at any of the others. Vessel, the Colorado start-up that provides the cups, has a similar program running in Boulder.
Many coffee drinkers in the San Francisco area are taking Blue Bottle’s announcement in stride.
“Of course it’s a good idea,” said freelance writer Tracy Schroth, at a Blue Bottle cafe in Oakland. “It’s such a small step to ask people to bring their own cup. People just have to get into the mindset.”
At a Blue Bottle in San Francisco, electrician Jeff Michaels said he does love the coffee but doesn’t want to pay more if he forgets a mug.
“I paid almost $7 for this coffee,” Michaels said, sipping a cafe mocha. “How much are people willing to pay for a coffee?”
Small-cafe owner Kedar Korde is optimistic that one day it will become trendy for coffee drinkers to carry around reusable mugs, just like stainless steel water bottles have become a must-have accessory in the San Francisco area.
Korde’s Perch Cafe in Oakland ditched paper and plastic cups in September, along with lids and straws.
“We now offer a glass jar that comes in a 12 ounce (350 milliliters) or 16 ounce (470 milliliters) size,” Korde said. Customers put down a 50 cent deposit and can return it for a refund or keep it and get 25 cents off future drinks. The cafe also sells 50 cent reusable sleeves for the jars.
Korde says he’s been surprised by how quickly customers have adapted. He was inspired to make the change after his 9-year-old daughter’s school did a cleanup project at Lake Merritt, across from his cafe, and found their disposable cups in the water.
His daughter joked that she shouldn’t have to clean her room if he couldn’t keep his stuff out of the lake, but he took it more seriously.
“We’re a small coffee shop. We’re not going to save the world,” Korde said. But at least “our cups are no longer winding up in the lake.”

31,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/nia-will-generate-several-economic-opportunities/,"The fate of Nijgadh International Airport in Bara district has become uncertain after the Supreme Court on December 22 continued the interim order of December 6 to halt all field works at the construction site. The SC’s direction followed a writ petition filed on August 22 expressing concerns related to the environmental impact of felling a large number of trees that are 500 to 600 years old at the project site. The stay order has thrown out of gear the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation’s plans to commence construction of the mega project this year. Centred around this issue, Arpana Ale Magar of The Himalayan Times caught up with Secretary of Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Kedar Bahadur Adhikari to know further about the challenges of NIA and with Secretary of the Ministry of Forests and Environment Bishwa Nath Oli to know about the current situation facing the country’s forest areas and existing rules on felling trees for development projects. Excerpts:

NIA will generate several economic opportunities
-Kedar Bahadur Adhikari, Secretary of MoCTCA
Firstly, could you explain the significance of NIA?
The major question is whether or not we want to improve our status from being one of the least developed countries. Nepal still does not have a full-fledged airport that can take advantages of air business. A full-fledged airport means having more than a single runway, terminal building, cargo building and big hangars, and aircraft maintenance centre, airport hotel and other infrastructure. NIA will have the capacity to handle 60 million passengers annually, which in turn will generate several economic opportunities. And for all these benefits, we are building NIA. NIA will support not only tourism and aviation sectors but also help diversify our trade through reliable cargo services. It could help the country meet the target of double digit growth. NIA is something the country needs, rather than just an object of desire. That is why this airport is a game changer project for the country’s economy.
What are the challenges for NIA construction?
Forest clearance at the construction site is the major challenge for us at present. Although the Environment Impact Assessment of the project has already been approved, we are yet to receive permission from the Ministry of Forests and Environment to fell trees for site clearance. Earlier we planned to select the contractor and clear the site simultaneously as the latter would take a bit longer time because after receiving permission from the forest ministry, we have to go through the tender process for site clearance. However, things didn’t go as per our plan. While some stakeholders are unable to comprehend our plan, we will move ahead after striking consensus among all the concerned authorities.
The Supreme Court recently decided to continue its interim order to halt felling trees at NIA. What is MoCTCA’s view on this decision?
This is just an interim order and not a final verdict of the SC. We have been informed that the order will only affect field work while we can still do other policy level works for the airport. We are hoping that the final verdict of the SC will be positive and we will receive a go-ahead for airport construction. Sometimes we have to lose something to gain something better. We hope that SC understands the country’s developmental needs. For now we have no other option than to wait for the final verdict.
What are the objections of the forest ministry?
Firstly, we had requested the forest ministry to allow us to cut down trees in around 2,500 hectares of land, which it rejected. Back then they had inquired whether all of that land was needed for the airport construction. Later our study showed that only 1,900 hectares of land is needed for the airport. We again sent another proposal to the forest ministry including all these details. Thus, we don’t have any issues with the forest ministry. But the apex court took a decision of halting field work around the same time that the forest ministry was finally taking a decision on site clearance process. This has delayed the airport construction. It has led us to suspect whether efforts are being made to drop this project.
Apart from the environmental issues, what are the other processes that the government is currently working on?
The government has recently shortlisted Zürich International Airport for NIA construction. Now we are waiting for their business proposals for NIA construction and operation. Selection of Zürich was the best decision as we have decided to operate this airport as per public-private partnership (PPP) modality. We don’t need to worry about its investment capacity, so investment will not be a problem. Soon we will ask them to submit proposals for investment and construction modalities. After they submit their project plan, we will negotiate based on our requirements for NIA.
And what about the previous detailed feasibility study prepared by the South Korean firm Landmark Worldwide?
We may have owed them if we had used the DFS that they had submitted. But as we have now decided to construct the airport according to PPP model, that DFS is no longer contextual. And the detailed project report (DPR) too is not a problem for NIA construction. We have enough documents that precisely explain the requirements of the airport. The DPR will be prepared by the Zürich Airport if we award the project to them. The construction company itself has to make DPR and we will give our inputs on this. Moreover, if the private sector does not build the airport, the Nepal government is capable enough to build it on its own. The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has also prepared DFS of this project. Based on that study we can take the project forward.


The new Forest Act aims to facilitate development projects 
-Bishwa Nath Oli, Secretary of MoFE
What are the criteria for providing forest area to development projects?
The forest ministry has recently implemented a completely new Forest Act 2019 from October 20 that has replaced the earlier Forest Act 1992. We also implemented the Environment Protection Act 2019 from the same date. The Forest Act has mentioned that a development project has to submit Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) to the forest ministry based on the project scale. As the older act needed to be reviewed to make it more contextual, we have brought the new act for the preservation of forests and the environment. The new Forest Act has provisioned to provide forest area for national priority projects under section 10. Section 10 has mentioned that development projects have to submit EIA, detailed project report (DPR) or detailed engineering design to the ministry while proposing forest area for the project. Likewise, a secretary-level recommendation from the respective ministry also needs to be submitted to prove the project is a national priority project.
What is the provision of felling trees for development projects?
Along with the new Forest Act, we have recently approved a framework to provide forest area to national priority projects. And the framework has mentioned that if any development project uses forest land, the project has to provide land equal to the area covered by the forest. As per the rule, development projects have to pay around Rs 1.4 million to Rs 1.5 million per hectare to use forest land. And if any development project has to cut down trees, it has to plant 10 trees for every one tree. In the late 90s, forest area covered 39 per cent of land in Nepal, while the latest data of 2015 shows that forest area has now reached 44.74 per cent of the total land. So we have reduced the number of trees that need to be planted compulsorily for felling trees in project sites. The earlier act had mentioned that 25 trees needed to be planted in place of one tree. If the project is not able to provide the land, then the act has also included a provision where the developer can compensate by paying the amount based on the valuation of the forest area. Once the project developer decides on one of the two options for acquiring the forest land, we will send the proposal to the Cabinet for approval.
But if project developers can simply pay for the forest area instead of compulsorily planting trees, how will the forests be preserved?
Earlier, we faced problems whereby project developers planted trees only for the sake of it. Some even planted invasive species of trees in the forest areas that adversely affected the ecological balance. The new rule is aimed at addressing this challenge while facilitating the development projects at the same time. But this does not mean that we are no longer taking care of the forests. The new Forest Act has introduced a provision of establishing a Forest Development Fund (FDF). The amount collected from the projects for permitting them to use forest area and cut trees will be used completely for forest development. From the collected amount, we will plant trees and organise programmes to preserve forests. The act is very strict about the collected amount to ensure that it is not misused. Soon we will implement the guideline of FDF too.
So, where will the trees be planted from this fund? A recent study conducted by the department under the forest ministry has revealed that 106 local units out of the 753 do not have forest areas. Technically, the trees have to cover at least half a hectare of land to be considered a forest. So, the 106 local levels do not have a forest. So, we will be planting trees in the open areas of these 106 local units. Likewise, trees will be planted in open areas at community-based forests, forests preserved by the government, among others. Likewise, there is a lot of public land where we can develop a forest. Thus, we have enough places for compensatory plantation. Already more than 50 per cent of local demand for wood is being supplied by private forest areas. The amount collected in this fund will not be added to the central treasury of the ministry.

The 45-megawatt Upper Bhotekoshi Hydropower Project has finally restarted commercial generation from today.
Though it had been previously commissioning energy since January 2001, the project had been closed after the April 25, 2015 earthquake and floods and landslides completely damaged the project.
The project had successfully conducted the latest test transmission on December 7.
Initially, the project had been partially damaged by the earthquake and later in July, 2016, the floods in the Bhotekoshi River completely damaged the project. The project was being reconstructed since the last two years. The reconstruction work of the Upper Bhotekoshi hydropower project was completed by Sinohydro’s Bureau 11, a Chinese company, at a cost of about Rs seven billion.
“We have completed all the necessary tests including, civil, hydroelectrical and hydromechanical works,” informed Bikram Sthapit, chief executive officer of the company.
As per him, due to the low flow of water in the winter season, they will be able to generate only 25 megawatts of electricity. “After the water level rises we will able to operate in a full-fledged manner,” he informed.
Earlier, after the reconstruction works were completed, the project tested the physical infrastructure and equipment of the hydropower plant.

33,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/govt-to-review-social-security-fund-guidelines/,"Kathmandu, December 23
After persistent complaints from employers, employees and other stakeholders regarding some provisions in the Social Security Fund (SSF) being unrealistic, the government has finally planned to review certain provisions in the SSF’s guidelines within three months. There have also been complaints that the guidelines discriminate between public and private sector employees and that participants in the fund will have to actually pay double taxes.
Moreover, stakeholders have also criticised the policy as both workers and employers seem to be reluctant to participate in the social security programme.
Kapilmani Gyawali, executive director of the Social Security Fund, said the government is going to make amendments as the fund has been receiving widespread criticism due to the lower benefits it offers and unprofitable provisions.
“We’re going to hire a group of ‘actuaries’ from abroad who will look into the issues being raised by different stakeholders and will make adjustments to the facilities that will be provided by SSF,” he said.
An actuary is a business professional who deals with the measurement and management of risk and uncertainty. The name of the corresponding field is actuarial science. These risks can affect both sides of the balance sheet and require asset management, liability management, and valuation skills.

Gyawali further said that the government was ready to amend the law after objections were raised regarding the age limit of retirement and insurance arrangements being unrealistic and the fund being discriminatory between public and private sector employees.
He said that the provision related to insurance and taxation will also be revised. “We will come up with arrangements that can be easily integrated into the fund.”
Last week, a team from the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry had also requested the government to revise and include more realistic provisions that could help attract more contributors.

Private telecom company Ncell risks losing additional frequency blocks it won in spectrum auction held last week if it is unable to clear the applicable outstanding capital gains tax, as well as the bid amount for the spectrum, by January 2.
Ncell, which was allowed to participate in the auction for residual frequency blocks in the 1,800 megahertz bandwidth on the condition that it would clear all its outstanding dues to the government, was the highest bidder with a bid amount of Rs 58 million per frequency block of 1 MHz, surpassing Nepal Telecom.
While the highest bidder has to pay the bid amount within 15 days of auction, Ncell also needs to clear its outstanding CGT within that period or else it will lose the spectrum to the next highest bidder, as per Nepal Telecommunications Authority.
“Should Ncell fail to comply with both these provisions within the stipulated time, Nepal Telecom, which was the second-highest bidder, will automatically become the successful bidder in the spectrum auction,” informed Purshottam Khanal, chairman of NTA.
Initially, Ncell was not eligible to participate in the spectrum auction, as a provision in the NTA’s specification states that any applicant for spectrum auction must have cleared all tax dues. However, the NTA board allowed Ncell to participate in the auction on the condition that if it won the bid, it would be awarded frequency blocks only after clearing its tax liabilities, including CGT to the government.
NTA allowed Ncell to participate in the spectrum auction also because otherwise NT would have been the sole bidder, as other telecom firms did not meet NTA specifications for the auction.
Once it complies with the stated provisions, Ncell will be able to purchase maximum of nine out of 16 1 MHz frequency blocks available in the 1,800 MHz bandwidth. This is because NTA has limited telecom firms to use a maximum of 20 1 MHz frequency blocks in 1,800 MHz bandwidth and Ncell is already using 11 1 MHz blocks in this bandwidth.
The Ncell CGT issue should have been settled by now after the latest verdict of the Supreme Court determined Rs 22.44 billion as remaining outstanding CGT in the Ncell buyout deal. But the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes — an international tribunal — last week issued an interim order to the government asking it not to initiate CGT collection process from Ncell.
To further complicate things, the Large Taxpayers Office yesterday gave an ultimatum to Ncell to clear its outstanding capital gains tax dues within 15 days, in contradiction to the ICSID’s interim order.

The programme was organised on August 16 and 17 at Kanjirowa National Secondary School in collaboration with Robotics Association of Nepal (RAN) and Nepal Robotics Project, USA, according to a press release issued by the organiser.

The main aim of the training was to promote STEM — focusing on both the practical and theoretical aspects of robotics in Nepal, reads the statement. As many as 28 participants from 18 schools were involved in learning about the fundamentals of STEM education, drone making, aerodynamics, principles of flying, among others.
Kapil Dev Regmi, Chairman of Kanjirowa School, highlighted that Nepal’s education system required a practical approach to encourage the students for innovation and research rather than promoting rote learning. He was hopeful that such training will be given priority in more schools in future.
Participating teachers had an opportunity to interact with one another and share their experiences on the condition of STEM education in Nepal. The programme was led by some innovative engineers having extensive knowledge of robotics and latest technological advancements in the field.
Michael Kronmiller from Nepal Robotics Project, US, Aliyah Pandoliff from Kashmir World Foundation, US, and Prof Sandra Magnus, former NASA Scientist and Astronaut sent messages for the success of the programme and expressed their interests to work further with Kanjirowa in STEM education in the future too.

42,https://thehimalayantimes.com/education/government-bars-pupils-from-pursuing-non-academic-courses-abroad/,"Kathmandu, June 12
Nepali students, who wish to pursue non-academic courses, like vocational education or language courses in countries such as Australia and Japan, will not be allowed to do so from now onwards, thanks to the government’s radical move aimed at curtailing the rights of high school graduates to make choices. What’s more, students who have not completed Grade XII will not be allowed to study abroad.
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology published a notice today stating that students who have completed Grade XII or equivalent will be given ‘no objection letters’ to study abroad only if they intend to pursue academic courses of bachelor’s level or above.
Students cannot study abroad without obtaining ‘no objection letters’. These letters are also essential to get foreign currency exchange facility.

“We will issue no objection letters even to those who wish to pursue technical and vocational education, language courses and academic bridge courses, which are similar to language courses. But those students will have to provide evidence to substantiate they will get enrolled in a university to pursue academic courses after completing vocational or language courses,” said MoEST Under-secretary Maheshwor Sharma.
This move will largely affect students intending to study in Australia. Many Australia-bound Nepali students join technical and vocational institutions. This is common among those pursuing nursing.
Technical and vocational education, which is a non-academic course, generally prepares students for the job market, as it is designed by conducting studies on the needs of several industries. Countries such as Australia, Germany and Switzerland are well known for their technical and vocational education courses.
The latest move will also hit students who leave for Japan to pursue language courses. Many of them have not even passed Grade XII.
The latest provision introduced by the government clearly states that students will not be given permission to study abroad if they have not completed Grade XII. At present, not many students prefer to study abroad before passing Grade XII, but the new provision prevents parents who can afford to, or students who wish to, from doing so.
“The new provisions were introduced on the basis of the law which states that students can only get enrolled in foreign institutions if they intend to pursue higher education,” said Sharma. He added, “We now define higher education as tertiary education and not education attained in Grade XI and XII.” Earlier, the government used to define education provided in grades XI and XII as higher education. This has changed after the government started recognising grades XI and XII as a part of high school.
“The government should not have introduced such a provision without holding consultation with stakeholders. This blanket provision will not do good to students planning to study abroad. Students should be allowed to go abroad if they can attain quality education,” said Kedar Bhakta Mathema, former vice-chancellor of Tribhuvan University.

Loughlin, who starred in the television sitcom “Full House,” and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli filed papers in federal court in Boston waiving their personal appearances at an arraignment hearing and asking to have not guilty pleas entered on their behalf.
They are among 50 people accused of participating in a massive scheme that allowed wealthy parents to use cheating and $25 million in bribes to help their children secure spots at well-known universities like Yale, Georgetown and USC.
California college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer pleaded guilty in March to charges that helped parents facilitate cheating on college entrance exams and bribed coaches at universities to falsely present their children as athletic recruits.
Prosecutors allege that Loughlin (54) and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USC’s crew team, even though they did not row competitively, to help them gain admission.
Loughlin and Giannulli provided Singer photographs of their daughters in order to create fake athletic profiles for them, which a USC athletics official in exchange for bribes then used to support recruiting them, prosecutors said.
The couple and several other parents were originally charged in March with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Prosecutors secured an indictment on April 9 that included an additional charge of conspiring to commit money laundering.
Several other parents charged alongside Loughlin and Giannulli also filed papers seeking to waive appearing at an arraignment and have not guilty pleas entered for them. A federal magistrate judge granted their requests on Monday.
In all, 33 parents have been charged in the college admissions scandal. Of those, 13 have agreed to plead guilty, including “Desperate Housewives” TV star Felicity Huffman. She is scheduled to plead guilty on May 21.

ULYSSES, KANSAS: A 16-year-old Kansas boy will soon earn his high school diploma — and a few days later he’ll travel to Harvard to collect his bachelor’s degree.
Ulysses High School senior Braxton Moral will attend both commencement ceremonies in May, becoming the only student to successfully pursue a four-year high school degree and a bachelor’s degree from Harvard at the same time, The Hutchinson News reported .
Harvard has changed the rules, Braxton’s father Carlos Moral said, so his son will “the one and only” reaching that milestone. Braxton Moral will be 17 when he gets his diplomas.
Carlos Moral said they began to realize their son was special when he was in the third grade.
“They told us: ‘You need to do something. He’s not just gifted. He’s really, really gifted,’” he said.
Braxton Moral skipped the fourth grade.
The Ulysses school district allowed him to take some high school classes while he was still in middle school. Before high school he took a class offered at Fort Hays State University. Then he was admitted into Harvard.
Braxton Moral simultaneously studied at the high school and the Harvard Extension School. The program typically serves adults who work and can’t attend classes on campus full time.
Ulysses High School math teacher Patsy Love served as the proctor for the Harvard program, administering Moral’s tests in Kansas. Moral spent the summer before his junior year at Harvard’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
“We constantly are monitoring Braxton to make sure he is not too overwhelmed,” said Julie Moral, Braxton Moral’s mother. “No achievement is worth him being unhappy.”
Braxton Moral is on track to graduate from the Bachelor of Liberal Arts program, with a major government and a minor in English, said Harry Pierre, associate director of communications for Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education.
Braxton Moral said he hopes to attend Harvard Law School next.
“Politics is end game for me,” he said, though he’s still too young to vote.

The event was organised targeting fresh graduates and eighth-semester students of IT and Engineering for internship and job placement.
Students of BE Civil, BE Computer, BE Electronics and Communication, and BSc CSIT from various colleges across the country received an opportunity of an on-the-spot interview for internship and job at a single venue. On-the-spot interview with top IT and engineering companies of Nepal was the main highlight of the event.
Dakshina Shrestha, Associate Professor and Head of Training and Placement Unit said, “The event was organised with an objective of helping students liaise with the industry and job market to make a smooth transition from college to corporate life. Many graduates were placed by online interviews. Overall, it was a win-win situation for both companies and graduates. The feedback we received was excellent. We were requested to organise such event every year.”

Courtesy: AP
BOSTON: The latest crop of US Rhodes scholars has more women than any other single class, and almost half of this year’s recipients of the prestigious scholarship to Oxford University in England are either immigrants or first-generation Americans, the Rhodes Trust announced Sunday.
Among the 32 winners is Harvard University senior Jin Park, the first recipient covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation.
Park, 22, of the New York City borough of Queens, arrived from South Korea with his parents when he was 7, studied molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, and founded a nonprofit to help undocumented students apply to college.
He hopes to become an immigrant advocate, saying it’s important for him to use the opportunity to better others, not just himself.
“When you grow up as an undocumented immigrant in America, that understanding that your talents don’t really belong to you in the traditional sense, that you have to share the fruits of your labor with others, that’s just something you learn,” Park said.
Alaleh Azhir, a 21-year old senior at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, emigrated from Iran when she was 14 — and is also one of 21 female scholars named Sunday. The New York City resident hopes eventually to become a doctor and will study women’s and reproductive health at Oxford.
“I’m just a passionate advocate for women in general and that’s mostly because of my background,” she said. “I thought that the way I could advocate for women could be by advocating for their health.”
At Chapman University in Southern California, Vidal Arroyo, 21, reflected on his unlikely path to becoming his school’s first Rhodes Scholar.
“As a Latino, a first-generation college student, and a train commuter to college, winning this scholarship means so much to me because it sheds hope for students from backgrounds like my own who have to overcome multiple barriers in pursuit of a higher education and a better future,” said Arroyo, who plans to study engineering science at Oxford.
And Eren Orbey, a 23-year-old senior at Yale University in Connecticut, whose parents emigrated from Turkey, hopes studying at Oxford will bring greater “context and clarity” to his writing. He is a regular contributor to The New Yorker magazine and is working on a book about his father, who was slain in Ankara when he was just 3, and the killer.
“I’m interested in studying the ethics of revenge and forgiveness,” Orbey said Sunday by email. “I think that our culture and media coverage often condescend to immigrants and survivors of trauma. In my writing, I hope to recast tragedy and strife as occasions for growth and heroism.”
The US Rhodes scholars join a separate, international group of scholars representing more than 60 countries.
Rhodes Scholarships provide all expenses for at least two years of study at Oxford. They were created in 1902 in the will of Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman and Oxford alum who was a prime minister of the Cape Colony in present-day South Africa.

LONDON: Football legend David Beckham has visited Indonesia – where one in three children have been physically attacked in school – to see how his charity, the 7 Fund, is combating bullying.
The A-list celebrity and former England captain launched the fund to protect the world’s most vulnerable youngsters in 2015 with the United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF).
“I feel very proud to see how my 7 Fund is helping UNICEF tackle bullying and violence in schools in Indonesia, and is ultimately keeping children, especially girls, safe in their schools so they can continue their education,” he said.
Bullying and violence are among the biggest worries for young people in Indonesia, with more than 1 in 5 teens aged 13 to 15 – or 18 million students – experiencing it, leading to mental health problems and school dropouts, UNICEF said.
The 7 Fund teaches children who have been bullied and former bullies to educate others and trains teachers to keep children safe. Bullying has been reduced by almost a third among the 7,000 children who have taken part in pilot programmes, it said.
“I spent time with an amazing young girl – Sripun – who was voted by her peers to take part in an anti-bullying programme to help stop violence in schools,” Beckham said in a statement.
“This has increased her confidence and she’s hopeful that other students won’t have to go through the same bullying experience she did.”
The fund — named after Beckham’s lucky number on his England and Manchester United shirts — focuses on children at risk of violence, abuse or disease.
Beckham, a father of four, has said that he hopes his own children will be proud of his work with the 7 Fund, which also has projects in Indonesia, Nepal, Uganda and El Salvador.

Vice-chairman of National Planning Commission Swarnim Wagle has said that setting the educational agenda has been a great challenge in the country.
Speaking at the 18th Annual General Meeting of Educational Journalist Group here today, he said the government had to give priority to education.
“The quality of education should be improved now that the local levels are responsible for handling and managing school education,” he said.
Around 40 per cent of budget is being sent to the local levels and preparations are also on to hand over different projects currently being handled by different non-governmental organisations to the local levels.
Similarly, former education minister Dhaniram Paudel said despite the handover of the education system to the local levels, the Ministry of Education, Department of Education and district education offices should handle the education system.
Madhu Prasad Regmi, secretary at the Ministry of Education, said 23 responsibilities of the education sector had been given to the local levels without hampering the educational system.
As all the basic and secondary schools are being handled by the local levels it will be easy to manage resources for the education sector from local resources, he added.
On the occasion, Mathura Yadav principal of Tribeni Primary School, Rupandehi, and Devi Khadka Pokhrel, member of School Management Committee of Kamala Secondary School, Sindhuli were honored at the programme.

Kathmandu
Teachers are guides for students providing students with valuable knowledge, which help students to excel in their studies as well as life in general. Teachers with decades of teaching experience in various colleges share important tips.

Study on a regular basis
Teachers suggest that students should give regular time to their studies. However, they say there is no fixed hours that they should set aside.
“Regular reading is a must,” says Bharat Kumar Bhattarai, who has 30 years of experience as a Nepali lecturer. He suggests students to prepare notes right from the beginning of the academic year and go through it regularly.
Saroj Pyakurel, Accounting lecturer in different colleges in Kathmandu, says that there is no fixed hours that students should give to their studies. However, according to Pya-kurel, who has 14 years of teaching experience, students should give as much time as they can daily, in which they would be able to understand the lessons taught every day. “Students themselves should decide how much time they should give regularly on a daily basis so they understand the lessons,” he suggests. He stresses that during holidays too, students should set aside at least three hours for revisions.
Educationist Prof Dr Bidya Nath Koirala says that the time students should give to their studies depends upon their nature. Some students learn fast and some slowly, so students themselves should find out how much time they should give to their studies according to their learning ability.

Tips for exam preparation
Educators suggest that students should go through all the topics of a subject in order to obtain good marks in exams.  Nepali lecturer Bhattarai suggests students to divide time according to the importance and marks of the topics. “For the exams you should not study selecting a few topics, but study all the topics in the text with the intention to understand each topic thoroughly.”
He says that students who select only few a topics to study for exams will not be able to do well. “Every topic in course is inter-related, and if students do not understand earlier topics, they will not be clear about the next chapter too,” he opines.
He also suggests students to prepare for exams by noting down important points of each chapter. Besides this, he says that students, who prepare notes from the beginning, will score good marks in exams as they will have already gained a deep knowledge of each chapter. However, he suggests avoiding using guides books and guess papers. “Students depending upon guide books and guess papers will ruin themselves,” he informs as “guide book writers are not responsible ones; they take it as a job and they are not responsible towards students’ progress.”

Be proactive
Students should not only depend upon the teachers’ notes but should also work on their own by studying reference materials, books from the library and doing online researches, as per the teachers.
“Teachers are limited within the circle of their knowledge and education, so students should also study and prepare from books by various writers. This will broaden their knowledge,” says Bhattarai.
Pyakurel also argues that students should not only depend upon their teachers and course books. “Students can benefit much from YouTube and Google as thousands of study materials are available there.”
He further says, “The mind is always motivated by desire, so students should also research on issues in which their interests lie.”

Questioning mind
Prof Dr Koirala says that raising questions is the most important feature of a learner. He says that students should always have questions in their mind and ask questions to themselves in order to learn. On any topic or issue, a student should ask questions: Why it is so? How did it happen? What is the mechanism behind it? How is it related with me? Raising such questions will make a student understand topics analytically, he says.

Clear vision
Sociology lecturer Uttam Prasad Devkota says that students should have a goal. Devkota has 13 years of experience in teaching.  “It is not that you study BBA because you completed your plus two level. Students should have a clear vision about their field of interest and about what they want to be in future,” points out Devkota. He adds that the students should not be limited to their course but should broaden their horizon by gaining knowledge on social, cultural, political and economic conditions of the country and people. Students should always notice what is happening in their society and country. This will make them explore the possibility of the current subject they are studying. They should not only prepare to get good results in exams but think of study and learning as a regular process, Devkota adds.

Kathmandu
Teej, one of the greatest festivals for Hindu women, is here. Students also celebrate this festival, and even if they don’t, they are affected by the festivities surrounding it as people from their friend circle or family members celebrate it. Sharing their views about this festival, they admit that the study environment college and homes is affected by the festival.
In celebratory mood
For most students the best aspect of this festival is that it strengthens the bond between female members in society as they meet and share their feelings with each other. They add that the singing, dancing and the celebration part of the festival is what they enjoy the most.
Nisha Khatiwada, a resident of Kapan and a Vth semester student of Bachelor of Public Health at the Karnali College of Health Sciences in Battisputali, says that it is fascinating to see women in red, dancing and singing folk songs on streets, going to temples in a holy and fasting mood.
Class environment
Rebecca Maghariya, a IVth year student of Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) at the Shanker Dev Campus in Putalisadak, says that as their college has no uniform, students come wearing red and green, or colourful kurta and also with mehendi on their hands two weeks prior to Teej. Maghariya is from Kailali and is currently residing in Thankot.
Maghariya’s classmate Pratiksha Gautam says Teej becomes a subject of all talks among classmates. Gautam hails from Rukum and is residing in Dillibazar. According to her, kind of clothes to wear and songs to sing during Teej become the main topics of talk in class starting a few weeks before the festival.
Effects on study
The students also admit they are distracted from their studies during the festival due to many reasons.
Neeru Poudel, a IVth Year BBS student at Shanker Dev Campus, says that the festival affected her when she was studying in BBS Ist Year as the board exam was on the same day. She was distracted from her studies as there was a celebratory environment at her home. According to her, this year too the BBS Ist Year board exams were scheduled on Teej but was postponed due to floods in Tarai. Poudel is from Syangja and residing in New Baneshwor. She says that music and other noise from Darr events at a nearby complex could be heard from her room. This disturbs her while doing her college assignments.
Umesh Bhakt Joshi, a IInd Year student of Bachelor of Law (LLB) at the Nepal Law Campus at Pradarshanimarg, says that around 50 per cent of female classmates in his class do not attend class from around two weeks prior to Teej. Joshi, from Bajhang and residing in Kirtipur, says almost all his female classmates are absent from Darr eating day till Rishi Panchami. He opines that as half the number of students remain absent, their lecturers show no interest in teaching and usually postpone classes for a week. There is also less possibility of female lecturers holding classes on those days, informs Joshi, adding that student unions in the college have organised Darr programme for students this year too as in previous years.
Shanta Bahadur Tamang of the Nepal Law Campus however, says that Teej celebration should not affect students regarding their studies as it depends upon students themselves on how to manage time. According to him, if some days are to be spent in celebrations, students should study those chapters early on or give extra time to the same after the festival ends.
Superstition
Apart from these aspects of Teej, Khatiwada said she does not believe bathing and performing other rituals on Rishi Panchami will purify women and earn them penance from the so-called mistakes they may have committed being and making others impure during periods. Such superstitions push women to an inferior position in society, she adds.

67,https://thehimalayantimes.com/education/the-hostel-life/,"Hasana Lawaju talks to college students who are living in hostels as they pursue their studies and finds out why students find it advantageous to stay in one


Hostel provides a good environment for studies — serious students take the best advantage while living in hostels. While there are the fun and challenges of living in a hostel, these are also the best places for students to live while pursuing their higher studies. Most students agree that they are motivated to study while saving their time as they attend their colleges while living in hostel.
Conducive study environment
Some students find hostel environment motivational to concentrate in their studies, especially during exams.  “Every student staying in a hostel usually has exams at the same time, and thus all are studying during that time,” says Bishwadeep Tamang, a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering, Bhaktapur. Tamang, who hails from Sankhuwasabha, is staying at Hostel Libali — a private hostel in Bhaktapur.
Tamang’s classmate as well as roommate Manish Dhakal echoes a similar view — “when a  friend is studying for exams at hostel, a competitive spirit develops among other friends, and as a result everyone is motivated to study”.
The motivation to study comes from seniors at her hostel for Manisha Khadka, Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) VIth Semester student.  Khadka, who studies at Padmakanya Multiple Campus, Baghbazar and stays in the college’s Pragya Chhatrawas, shares, “When I see my seniors — especially Master’s level students — studying sincerely, I am inspired to study properly.”
Living in a hostel with classmates becomes advantageous, especially when one misses a class or does not understand the topic taught in the classroom.  “Whenever I do not understand any topic taught by the teachers, I can consult my roommates or other friends in the hostel who have a better understanding of the topic,” points out Kshitij Dahal, BE (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering. Dahal also resides in Hostel Libali.
However, Sharmila Upadhyaya staying at Padma Girls Hostel in Pulchowk, has a different experience. Initially, when she started living in the hostel three-and-a-half years ago, it was difficult for her to adjust because she was not used to studying in group. But with time, she has gotten used to it.
Upadhyaya, BE (Computer Engineering) VIIIth Semester student at the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk,  shares her hostel offers a good environment for students as it “only selects students after checking their academic performances”.
Life made easier
Khadka’s hostel is next to her college premises. “It takes me only a few minutes to reach my hostel. So, my time is not wasted in travelling,” says Khadka, who hails from Butwal. Living near the college, she claims to utilise most of her time for studies.
Had Dhakal, whose house is in Kapan, chosen to commute to his college in Bhaktapur from his home “I would have spent at least four hours daily just travelling in bus”. Thanks to his decision to stay in a hostel, he is able to save valuable time.
The students also need not cook or do laundry and cleaning as most hostels provide students with food, laundry and other services.

“We do not need to cook, wash dishes or clothes, and it is convenient for us,” Tamang shares.
Along with that other facilities are available in the hostels. For instance, the three-and-a- half storey Pragya Chhatrawas has made one study hall available in each floor for students along with Wi-Fi facility, as per Geeta Tandukar, a third class officer at General Administration Division of the Padmakanya Multiple Campus.
Kutumba Boys Hostel, Jawalakhel receives students’ report cards from their respective colleges. “We wake the students up early in the morning, monitor their studies, talk to the parents if their children are not concentrating in their studies or have poor academic performances,” hostel coordinator Bandana Khatri reveals.
More than studies
Be it a hostel run by the college or a private one, most make students’ academics the priority. But they also provide opportunities for students to have fun. As such, the occasional celebrations in hostels are the best moments for students like Khadka. They celebrate Teachers’ Day where they offer treats to their teachers and also celebrate birthday of their hostel warden, as per Khadka.
Hostel wardens too support the students in such endeavours. Rakesh Machamasi, Warden of Hostel Libali informs, “We prepare delicacies like Dahi Chiura, Khir, Yomari et cetera  on different occasions for the hostel students and we all celebrate together. Our students find such celebrations interesting.”
Dissatisfaction 
Most students agree that hostels provide them with a good study environment. However, they have some dissatisfaction too, mostly about the food served.
“Sometimes, the food served by our hostel is not hygienic. At times I have found insects and hair in the food, though it does happen always,” complains Khadka.
Dahal has some objection with the meat-policy of his hostel. “Our hostel serves meat every Wednesday. But if I do not feel like eating on that day and want to have meat on some other day, that is not possible,” Dahal argues.
But Upadhyaya puts forth a different opinion. “It is not what we want to eat, but what is available. If we do not eat properly, no one in the hostel will convince us to eat. As such habits like not eating on time  can even affect our health. So, rather than complaining, we should learn to take care ourselves,” she opines.

NEW YORK: Lindsey Vonn popped the question to hockey star PK Subban.
“Merry Christmas and happy holidays everyone!! On our 2 year anniversary, in a “non traditional” move, I asked PK to marry me and he said, Yes,” Vonn tweeted on Christmas Day. “Yes (bashful emoji) ! Women aren’t the only ones who should get engagement rings!”
The former ski racer closed the tweet with the hashtags “MerryChristmas” and “equality.”
Vonn linked a picture of herself and Subban with the ring, with the couple wearing matching striped pajamas in front of a Christmas tree with three dogs in the foreground. She also posted a close-up of Subban flashing the ring, with the words “Drip drip”and a blue teardrop.
Vonn also said on social media in August that they were engaged.
The 35-year-old Vonn recently retired from a skiing career that included three Olympic medals, four overall World Cup titles and 82 World Cup race wins, a record for a woman.
The 30-year-old Subban and won the 2013 Norris Trophy with Montreal as the NHL’s top defenseman. He was traded to New Jersey from Nashville in June.
Vonn had a high-profile relationship with Tiger Woods. She previously was married to former ski racer Thomas Vonn, and kept his last name after they separated.

KATHMANDU: Nepal’s famous folk-rock band, Nepathya, performed at the Palms at Crown, entertainment venue, in Melbourne of Australia, on Monday.
The show kicked off with Nepathya’s popular number “Bheda ko Un Jasto” with a synchronised video and light at a sold-out auditorium.
While performing the song, the band’s lead singer Amrit Gurung paused and said, “Yesterday, we have lost one of our founding members—Suk Gurung–who gave us hit song ‘Chakyo Chakyo Deurali Danda,” and paid tribute to late Gurung from the stage.”
“May his soul rest in peace,” Amrit Gurung added.
As the show went on, the band performed their hit numbers–Taal Ko Pani, Yo Jindagini, Resham among others.
As usual, Gurung was supported by Dhurba Lama on drums, Suraj Thapa on keyboards, Subin Shakya on bass guitar, Niraj Gurung on guitars and Shanti Raymajhi on madal.
With this show, Nepathya’s concert entourage ends its Australia tour and heads back home on Tuesday.

70,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/disney-cuts-lesbian-kiss-from-star-wars-in-singapore/,"KUALA LUMPUR: Disney has cut a lesbian kiss from the latest “Star Wars” movie – one of the top Christmas films – Singapore’s media regulator said on Tuesday, so that more children can watch it.
The two minor female characters embrace but do not kiss in the version of “The Rise of Skywalker” shown in Singapore, local media said, as the ninth and final film in the celebrated science-fiction series rakes in millions from loyal fans.
“The applicant has omitted a brief scene which under the Film Classification Guidelines would require a higher rating,” a spokeswoman from Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Disney, which owns the “Star Wars” production company Lucasfilm, did not respond to a request for comment on its decision to cut the scene from the last installment of the second highest-grossing movie franchise of all time.
It concludes a story that began in 1977, when filmmaker George Lucas introduced a young hero named Luke Skywalker and delighted audiences with a galaxy of robots, furry warriors known as Wookiees and a host of other eclectic characters.
Sex between men is illegal in Singapore and punishable with up to two years in prison, though the British colonial-era law is rarely enforced. The law does not apply to sex between women.
Singapore activists challenged the law last month as polls suggested attitudes toward homosexuality are softening and similar legislation was scrapped in India last year.
The film is rated PG-13 in Singapore without the kiss scene, meaning parental guidance is advised for children below 13. Higher ratings mean it could be restricted only to viewers aged 16, 18 or 21 and above.
In 2016, the Singapore organisers of the musical “Les Miserables” removed a scene in which two male actors kiss after complaints from the public.
Disney declined to respond to a question about censorship in other markets, including the Middle East, amid media reports that lesbian kiss has also been deleted from screenings of “The Rise of Skywalker” in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

UNCASVILLE: Organizers wanted to make it clear the 99th Miss America competition isn’t your grandmother’s beauty pageant, and their winner did just that on Thursday.
Virginia biochemist Camille Schrier won the crown just minutes after wowing the crowd with science. Dressed in a lab coat, she gave a colorful chemistry demonstration of the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.
Schrier, a native of Pennsylvania, said she hopes to “break stereotypes about what it means to be a Miss America in 2020” by being a “woman of science” who is authentic to herself.
“I’m not the beauty queen,” she said. “I’m the brand ambassador for this organization and I’m more than just someone with a crown on my head.”
Victoria Hill of Georgia placed first runner-up.
No longer called contestants, the 51 women “candidates,” who hailed from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, competed for a $50,000 scholarship and the “job” of Miss America, a one-year paid position they hope to use as a public platform for their “social impact initiative.”
For the second year in a row, women were not judged in a swimsuit or how they look in an evening gown. Instead, a series of interviews and talent demonstrations will determine who is best qualified to wear this year’s crown.
“To make it relevant for these young women, it was important for us as a scholarship and service organization to make sure that we were reflective of this generation, meaning that you no longer had to be defined by some sort of ideal,” said Regina Hopper, president & CEO of the Miss America Organization.
Schrier, 24, who spoke on stage about having tackled an eating disorder, said she decided to compete for Miss America after the swimsuit competition was ditched, along with other changes that have been made to modernize the organization.
“I kind of figured that I would never get on that stage because I was a woman who did not want to get into a swimsuit on stage. And I didn’t have a performing talent, which is really ironic now,” she said, adding how she’s the first Miss America to win with a science experiment, a presentation she brings to schools.
Schrier is a cum laude graduate of Virginia Tech with dual bachelor of science degrees in bio chemistry and systems biology and she is currently studying to obtain a doctor of pharmacy degree.￼ Her platform issue is drug safety.
Morgan Nichols, Miss South Carolina, had her own message on Thursday night. She walked down the red carpet wearing a billowing, long skirt topped by a plain white T-shirt that read: “Stronger.”
While Hopper acknowledges there has been some push-back from “old pageant” people who liked the old way of doing things, she said there’s been greater interest in the competition since the roll-out of Miss America 2.0.
When asked on stage whether the Miss America organization should change even more and allow married women and women with children to participate, both Schrier and Hill said no. Schrier told reporters afterward that she believes the job would be too busy for a mother.
This year also marked the first time the multi-day event is being held at Mohegan Sun, a tribal casino and entertainment complex in suburban southeastern Connecticut. Miss America organizers announced plans this summer to leave Atlantic City, New Jersey — for the second time in its history.
Miss America also switched from ABC back to NBC to broadcast the glitzy finale to an estimated 4.5 million viewers. And for the first time, preliminary events and the finale — held in Mohegan’s 10,000-seat arena — are being streamed live on the NBC app.
“We’ve had many, many large events. This probably reaches the most people,” said Jeff Hamilton, president and general manager of Mohegan Sun. “We’re just really, really excited about it.”
Miss America organizers and NBC have not yet agreed to a multi-year contract with the Connecticut casino. A decision is expected in the coming months.
Schrier succeeds 2019 Miss America Nia Franklin, a classically trained opera singer from New York.
The decision to drop the swimsuit competition did create great controversy and criticism of Miss America officials, including former board chair and former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, who said in 2018 that Miss America would represent “a new generation of female leaders focused on scholarship, social impact, talent and empowerment.” Carlson has since stepped down.
Atlantic City businessmen came up with the idea for a pageant in 1921 as a way to extend the summer tourism season beyond Labor Day weekend. It became synonymous with the New Jersey seaside resort but moved to Las Vegas in 2005, returning to Atlantic City in 2013.

72,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/little-miss-period-tackles-japans-menstruation-taboos-with-a-punch/,"
TOKYO: Her timing can be terrible and she can pack a mean punch.
But “Little Miss Period” – a pink blob with red lips and red pants who stars in a Japanese manga comic and movie of the same name – has a mission: breaking taboos in a society where talking about menstruation has been seen dirty or embarrassing.

The character has generally been received positively as a step toward better understanding among the sexes. Some critics, though, worry about stereotypes and inattention to underlying gender discrimination that holds back Japanese women in many fields.
“Until now, menstruation has been something to hide and many people completely lack correct understanding of it,” said Kazue Muta, a sociology professor at Osaka University.
“I can’t praise the manga 100% … but it would be good if it were a step toward greater openness and education.”
The movie “Little Miss Period” was released domestically by entertainment company Yoshimoto Kogyo Co Ltd last month. It is based on a manga by male artist Ken Koyama that debuted in 2017 before being compiled into a book by publisher Kadokawa.
The film also opened in Taiwan this month and will debut in Hong Kong in January. Premieres in China and across Southeast Asia are also planned.
The topic of menstruation caught public attention in Japan recently when department store Daimaru suggested female employees wear a “period badge” to alert co-workers to their cycle. The plan sparked accusations of harassment and the store is reconsidering.
In the manga series, Little Miss Period – “Seiri-chan” in Japanese – delivers a punch to the gut that lays some women out flat before drawing blood with a syringe. When a woman’s husband fails to sympathise, he gets a “period punch” of his own to help him understand.
History gets a nod, with the tale of a feudal era Japanese girl forced to stay in a secluded hut because of the belief that menstruating females are unclean.
The movie version focuses on Aoko, a publishing firm editor whose male boss shows little compassion for her monthly pain. Aoko’s widower boyfriend is raising a young daughter. “If only men could get periods, even just once a year,” Aoko laments.
Feminist author Minori Kitahara welcomed efforts to break taboos but lamented that the representations were “treating the matter like a comedy talk show.”
Nobuyoshi Yoshida, 33, said he found the movie instructive. “Men don’t get how harsh menstruation can be for some women,” he said as he exited a cinema. “This was easy to understand.”
His girlfriend Kumiko Hanazawa, 32, was succinct: “I want men to watch this.”

73,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/anna-karina-the-icon-of-french-new-wave-cinema-dies-at-79/,"PARIS: Anna Karina, the French New Wave actress who became an icon of the cinema in the 1960s and was the muse of Jean-Luc Godard, has died. She was 79.
The French culture minister announced her death on Twitter on Sunday. French media said that the Danish-born Karina had cancer and died Saturday.

”Her look was the look of the New Wave. It will remain so forever,” Culture Minister Franck Riester tweeted.
“Anna Karina radiated. She magnetized the entire world,”‘ Riester said, adding that ”French cinema has lost one of its legends.”
Karina made seven films with Godard, her partner at the time, including the 1961 “Une Femme Est Une Femme” (A Woman is a Woman), in which she played a femme fatale. For that, she received the best actress award at the Berlin Film Festival. Other cult Godard movies starring Karina included the 1962 “Vivre Sa Vie'” (Live Your Life) and the 1965 “Pierrot Le Fou.”
Karina captured film-goers with her large blue doe eyes and acting and singing talents.
The French New Wave broke with traditional cinematic conventions to create a fresh approach to making movies, in keeping with the free-spirited times.
Godard wasn’t the only director with whom Karina worked. Jacques Rivette’s 1966 film “La Religieuse” (The Nun), adapted from the 18th-century French novel by Diderot, was initially banned. The story of a young woman forced into the convent by her mother, who had given birth out of wedlock, was revived in a restored version and presented at the 2018 Cannes film festival.
Born Hanne Karin Blarke Bayer in Denmark, she initially modelled and sang in cabarets before coming to France. She was reportedly discovered, and renamed, by Coco Chanel, then discovered by Godard.
Karina also worked, among other illustrious directors, with Luchino Visconti.
In a bold undertaking at the time, the actress later got behind the camera to make her own movie in 1973, “Vivre Ensemble” (Living Together).
Films that Karina has appeared in will be shown on the silver screen again with a retrospective of Godard starting next month at the Cinemateque, a noted film institution in France which she had frequented.

KATHMANDU: After successfully performing in Brisbane, Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart, Nepal’s famous folk-rock band, Nepathya, captivated the full-house audience at Big Top Auditorium in Luna Park of Sydney, Australia, on Saturday.
Performing for the fifth time in Sydney, Nepathya, entertained the audience with their mix of old and new songs with a great effect of the latest technology at the sold-out auditorium this weekend.
With this show, Sydney hosted Nepathya’s concert for the record fifth time. Nepathya has already performed more than five times in Kathmandu, Pokhara, Butwal, Chitwan, Hetauda and Dhangadhi within Nepal.
As the show went on, band’s lead singer and social activist Amrit Gurung said, “I still remember our first concert ten years ago as there were fewer Nepalis living in Sydney. However, during the last decade, Nepali diaspora has migrated looking for opportunities all over the globe.”
“Nepal would be a prosperous nation if it could do enough to stop the flow of brain-drain in the near future,” Amrit Gurung added.
“I see future in youths like you, who have gained knowledge, skills and experience in a foreign land, to transform the course of the nation like ours. Although our predecessors failed to create opportunities for us, we should be able for the next generation in Nepal, “Amrit Gurung shared.
As usual, Gurung was supported by Dhurba Lama on drums, Suraj Thapa on keyboards, Subin Shakya on bass guitar, Niraj Gurung on guitars and Shanti Raymajhi on madal.
After the Sydney show, Nepathya’s concert entourage will head to final stop-over in Melbourne to perform on December 23, the band said.
Nepathaya is currently touring Australia for the fifth time with new music series.

77,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/lemonade-by-beyonce-is-named-the-aps-album-of-the-decade/,"NEW YORK: The top 15 albums of the decade by Associated Press Music Editor Mesfin Fekadu:

Beyoncé, “Lemonade”: At the beginning of this decade, Beyoncé was already the greatest singer of her generation. She won a record six Grammys in a single night, had women AND MEN “oh-oh-oh’ing” to the fun sound of “Single Ladies” and continued to be a beast of a performer. But somehow Superwoman — shoot, she’s Superman, too! — found a way to do more: Like a boss she launched her own company, Parkwood Entertainment, and really took the bull by the horns of her career. In 2011, she released the R&B adventure “4,” featuring classics like “Countdown,” “Love on Top,” “Party,” “End of Time,” “I Care” and “I Miss You.” Three years later — in surprise form — came “Beyoncé,” her bold, audacious and daring album that showcased a new side of Beyoncé: Goodbye was the girl who cared about topping the charts, and born was an artist, a true storyteller, a grown woman. Somehow, she topped herself again with “Lemonade,” which still tastes as good as it did when it was released in 2016. The usually private Beyoncé bares her soul on the album, singing about a troubled relationship, black pride and motherhood in a brave way. Lyrically, she’s on point and honest over beats and sounds that range from rap to rock to country and pop. “Who the (expletive) do you think I am,” she brashly asks on “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” which co-stars Jack White. The answer: the greatest of all time.
Rihanna, “Anti”: Something was in the water in 2016: Beyoncé delivered “Lemonade” and Rihanna gave us the best album of her career with “Anti.” Rihanna had been moving like the Energizer Bunny since releasing her first album in 2005. She also put out albums in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 — showing that she was a singer who knew how to pick a hit, record it and make it sound better than any other artist could. But she took four years to create “Anti,” and the time was used wisely. No need to hit the skip button on this album as Rihanna shows her sultry side on “Kiss It Better,” her twerk side on “Work” and her vocal chops on “Love on the Brain.” Her hard work, work, work, work, work, work has truly paid off.


Beyoncé, “Beyoncé”: See earlier entry.
Adele, “21”: Back in my day — well in 2010 — record labels sent albums months in advance, and in November 2010 I received Adele’s “21.” Everything else around had to be turned off. I was sucked in. Months later, so was the world. THE ENTIRE WORLD. Adele was impressive on her 2008 debut, especially on “Hometown Glory,” but with “21” she went deep, too deep, she was rolling in the deep! Literally. Each song made you feel something — sad, lonely, bouncy, fired up, calm, angry, lost. And nine years later, each song sounds as classic as they did at first listen, especially “Turning Tables,” “Set Fire to the Rain” and the incomparable “Someone Like You.”
Kendrick Lamar, “good kid, m.A.A.d city”: All of Kendrick Lamar’s albums released this decade have been masterpieces, including the 2011 independent release “Section.80” as well as the major-label projects “To Pimp a Butterfly” and “DAMN.,” which won him the Pulitzer Prize for music as he made history as the first non-classical or jazz artist to win the prestigious prize. Lamar has profoundly mixed his poetry with hip-hop, jazz, soul, funk and African music to create songs that tackle blackness, street life, police brutality, survival and self-worth. And with 2012’s “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” this great kid immediately raised the bar not in only in hip-hop, but in music period, forcing his peers to do better and try harder.
HAIM, “Days Are Gone”: The sister trio HAIM reached perfection on their debut album. Hit play. And that is all.
SZA, “Ctrl”: SZA is masterful and introspective on her confessional debut album, which follows a young woman going through life and the turbulent experiences that come with it, from dating dusty boys to dealing with self-doubt.


Janelle Monáe, “The ArchAndroid”: According to contemporary pop folklore, Janelle Monae arrived on the pop landscape from another planet, and boy do we need more artists from that sphere to land here now. On the beautifully theatrical “The ArchAndroid,” she brilliantly paints the picture of an android, Cindi Mayweather, who finds out she is the chosen one and is trying to figure out how to handle her newfound mission. The versatile album has so many highpoints, including the Fela-flavored “Dance or Die,” the playful “Tightrope,” the groovy “Locked Inside” and the addictive “Faster.”
Katy Perry, “Teenage Dream”: I’ll quote the opening line of my 2010 “Teenage Dream” review, which came before the album matched the record Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” set by launching five No.1 hits: “Katy Perry’s new CD is like a magical slot machine: Select any song and you’ll hear a hit.”
Bruno Mars, “24K Magic”: Bruno Mars released three epic albums this decade, but “24K Magic” was a whole mood.
Solange, “A Seat at the Table”: Solange’s art-piece of an album will move you to think, and sing along, at the same time.
Sam Smith, “In the Lonely Hour”: Unrequited love ruled Sam Smith’s debut album, introducing the world to a piercing voice that is brave and honest.
Nas, “Life Is Good”: Nas is still the best rapper alive. Don’t at me.
Taylor Swift, “1989”: After dabbling in it on “Red,” former country singer Taylor Swift hopped, skipped and jumped into the pop music world with “1989,” an adventurous album full of hits, hits and more hits.
Kacey Musgraves, “Golden Hour”: With timeless songs like “Space Cowboy,” “Butterflies,” “Slow Burn” and “Lonely Weekend,” Kacey Musgraves proved to not just be golden, but grand.

79,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/frozen-2-leads-box-office-again-playmobil-flops/,"NEW YORK: “Frozen 2” blanketed multiplexes for the third straight weekend, continuing its reign at No. 1 with $34.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.
The Walt Disney Co animated sequel has already grossed $919.7 million worldwide. It will soon become the sixth Disney release this year to cross $1 billion, a record sure to grow to seven once “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” hits theatres later this month. Early next week, Disney will cross $10 billion at the global box office this year.

But the weekend overall at the box office was yet another disappointing one for the movie industry. A handful of under-performing releases and a relatively thin wide-release schedule hasn’t helped the 5.6% slide in domestic ticket sales from last year, according to data firm Comscore.
This weekend produced an outright flop in “Playmobil: The Movie,” the week’s only new wide release. The STX Films release was never expected to do well, but it bombed so thoroughly that it will rank among the worst-performing wide-releases ever. It grossed $668,000 in 2,337 venues, giving it a per-theatre average of just $286.
A handful of companies combined to produce the $75 million French film, including Wild Bunch and Pathe.
The top five films were almost unchanged from last weekend.
Rian Johnson’s acclaimed, star-studded whodunit “Knives Out” remained in second place with $14.2 million, declining a modest 47% in its second week of release. With $63.5 million cumulatively and $124.1 million worldwide, the Lionsgate release has been one of the season’s bright spots.
So has James Mangold’s “Ford v Ferrari,” which stayed in third place with $6.5 million over its fourth weekend. The racing drama, starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, has sped to a global take of $168 million for Disney, which acquired the film’s original studio, 20th Century Fox, earlier this year. The film cost about $100 million to make.
Melina Matsoukas’ outlaw romance “Queen & Slim” moved up to fourth in its second week with $6.5 million, swapping places with Marielle Heller’s Mister Rogers drama “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” ($5.2 million in its third weekend).
Todd Haynes’ true-story legal drama “Dark Waters,” starring Mark Ruffalo as a defense attorney who takes on the DuPont chemical company, expanded nationwide to 2,011 theatres. The Focus Features release made $4.1 million.
Celine Sciamma’s acclaimed period romance “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” opened at two locations with a very strong $33,552 per-theatre average. Neon will release the French film wider in February.
Some of the weekend’s most widespread movie watching may have been on Netflix, though the streaming service doesn’t disclose viewership tallies or box-office receipts.
After a three-week theatrical run, Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story,” one of the year’s most critically acclaimed films, began streaming Friday. On Friday, Nielsen said Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” last weekend drew an average audience of 13.6 million viewers from Nov. 27 to Dec. 1. Netflix has said Nielsen numbers, which only estimate US viewership, reflect an incomplete picture.
Amazon likewise didn’t release ticket sales for “The Aeronauts,” which opened in 52 theatres over the weekend. Tom Harper’s film, which cost $40 million to make, stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as 19th century balloonists.
A week before it opens in North America, Sony’s “Jumanji: The Next Level” debuted in 18 international countries where it made $52.5 million. The sequel to 2017’s “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” which grossed $962 million worldwide, is expected to lead the box office next weekend.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at US and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

During the show, the band’s lead singer Amrit Gurung requested the Nepali youths to love their nation despite living in a foreign land. “We are extremely happy to perform here and delighted to see audience’s love and affection to Nepali music,” Gurung added.

82,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/marriage-story-dominates-gotham-awards-with-4-wins/,"NEW YORK: Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” was the resounding winner at the IFP Gotham Awards, taking four awards including best feature at the annual New York awards-season kickoff.
By the end of the night on Monday, Baumbach, having long ago exhausted his one prepared speech, stood at the podium exhorting cast members Adam Driver and Laura Dern to lend him help. Having already given their own speeches — Driver for best actor, Dern as a tribute honoree — they demurred, content to watch Baumbach squirm again while he improvised a few remarks.

Baumbach turned, ultimately, to his actors — “My special effect, my everything is the cast,” he said — and to Netflix for what he called its “unconditional” support of his film, a portrait of divorce starring Driver and Scarlett Johansson. Earlier, Baumbach thanked Netflix, too, for saving the Manhattan single-screen Paris Theatre, which the streaming company purchased last week.
Praise for Netflix and its chief content creative officer Ted Sarandos, who was also in attendance, was a common refrain throughout the evening. The streaming service, which filled up numerous tables at the banquet at Cipriani’s Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, also celebrated wins for Ava DuVernay’s Central Park Five series “When They See Us,” (DuVernay was additionally singled out for tribute) and the documentary “American Factory.”
The Gothams, now in their 29th year, is the premier New York gala for independent film, a kind of earlier East Coast corollary to Los Angeles’ Independent Film Spirit Awards in February. Put on by the nonprofit Independent Film Project with nominees selected by committees, Gotham winners can diverge from seasonal favourites. Last year, Chloe Zhao’s lyrical Western “The Rider” took the best feature.
But a recent stretch of Gotham winners went on to land best picture at the Academy Awards, including Barry Jenkins’ “Moonlight,” Tom McCarthy’s “Spotlight” and Alejandro Inarritu’s “Birdman.”
And “Marriage Story,” which begins streaming Friday after playing for several weeks in theaters, seems sure to continue a long march through awards season. Acclaim has been heaped on its leads and its ensemble, and it’s been celebrated as a crowning achievement for the 50-year-old Baumbach.
While not a surprise to others, the most shocked winner of the evening was easily Awkwafina, who took the best actress for her performance in Lulu Wang’s family drama “The Farewell.”
“Oh my god. I never won anything. I can’t even win an argument in the Instagram comments,” said Awkwafina.
A handful of movies up for best feature — “Uncut Gems” with Adam Sandler, “Hustlers” with Jennifer Lopez — went home emptyhanded. Trey Edward Schultz’ ambitious family melodrama “Waves,” also up for best feature, scored an award for Taylor Russell as a breakthrough actor.
The Gotham Awards liberally sprinkle in tributes throughout the ceremony. This year’s honorees included Dern, DuVernay, Sam Rockwell, FilmNation chief executive Glen Basner and Jason DaSilva, a filmmaker and disability rights activist. DaSilva’s Emmy-winning documentary “When I Walk” chronicles his own experience with multiple sclerosis.
DuVernay shared her tips for directing, among them: treat actors and crew the same, don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know” and change your socks at lunchtime.
Both Baumbach and Greta Gerwig presented Dern with her award, donning what they called “Laura Dern sweaters” for the occasion. The two filmmakers, aside from living together as a couple with a son, share Dern in their latest movies. In “Marriage Story,” Dern plays a ruthless divorce attorney. In Gerwig’s “Little Women” (an upcoming Sony Pictures release ineligible for the Gothams), she plays Louisa May Alcott’s benevolent matriarch Marmee.
Gerwig and Baumbach swapped their speeches, which resulted in Baumbach declaring that he loved Dern “even more than Leonardo DiCaprio, who I sincerely believed I would someday marry.”
The Gothams reliably serve as pep rallies for independent cinema and those that toil in the ever-threatened lower-budgeted realm of moviemaking. Presenter Natasha Lyonne, whose Netflix series “Russian Doll” was nominated for best breakthrough series in episodes less than 40 minutes, evoked that sense of indie pride with more than a touch of sarcasm.
“If there’s one thing everyone in the room can agree on,” Lyonne said while presenting, “it’s that we can never have enough Batman movies.”

The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame band will play April 23 at Northern Kentucky University’s BB&T Arena, across the Ohio River 7 miles south of the Dec 3, 1979, concert site, where another two dozen people were injured Dec. 3, 1979, amid confusion and lack of preparation for thousands of fans lined up for hours for first-come seats.

The announcement came after WCPO-TV in Cincinnati aired a Tuesday night documentary featuring interviews with lead singer Roger Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend, the remaining original members of the British band that emerged in the 1960s featuring songs of youthful rebellion such as “My Generation” and its “Summertime Blues” cover.
Both have said they’ve been haunted by the tragedy. Townshend recently told The Associated Press he was looking forward to discussing it in Cincinnati.
“Now we can have a conversation about it when we go back,” Townshend said.
“We will meet people and we’ll be there. We’ll be there. That’s what’s important,” he said. “I’m so glad that we’ve got this opportunity to go back.”
The band is adding the concert to its “Moving On!” tour 2020 dates.
The Who said it will donate a portion of proceeds from the Cincinnati area concert to a memorial scholarship fund benefiting students in the Cincinnati suburb of Finneytown. Daltrey visited a Finneytown High School memorial site in 2018 and the band has for years supported the scholarship effort there. Three of the 11 killed, including two 15-year-old girls who were the youngest victims, had attended Finneytown High.
The band didn’t know about the tragedy until the concert was ending. Longtime manager Bill Curbishley had made the decision to have the show go on, warning Cincinnati authorities that they wouldn’t be able to control the crowd if the concert was called off.
“Despite everything, I still feel inadequate,” he told WCPO. “I don’t know about the guys, but for me, I left a little bit of my soul in Cincinnati.”

Hit animated movie takes inspiration from Sámi culture
Sámi people live in northern Europe
“Frozen 2” dubbed in North Sámi, rare move for a blockbuster

OSLO: The sequel to Walt Disney Co’s 2013 hit animated musical “Frozen” is generating excitement among indigenous Sámi people in northern Europe, whose culture the movie has taken inspiration from.
“Frozen 2” debuted in US cinemas on Nov 22 and is progressively rolling out worldwide. On its debut weekend, it grossed $350 million, making it “the biggest opening ever for Walt Disney Animation (not including Pixar)”, according to Hollywood trade publication Variety. The movie opens in Norway on Christmas Day.

Norway inspired many elements of the first “Frozen” movie, such as character Anna’s dress or the architecture of the fictional kingdom of Arendelle.
The second film takes inspiration from the culture of the Sámi, an indigenous minority living across Norway, Sweden, Finland and northern Russia, who have faced discrimination against their language and culture.
In Norway, a state-appointed truth and reconciliation commission is investigating the discrimination perpetrated on minorities including the Sámi and Kven peoples.
“I am planning to see the movie again with my whole family,” said Aili Keskitalo, president of the consultative Sámi Parliament in Norway, who attended the film’s world premiere in Los Angeles with her 11-year-old daughter and set a scene from the movie as her Facebook profile picture.
“Frozen 2” sees Anna and sister Elsa head north of Arendelle to find out the truth about a mystery. They meet the Northuldra, who live closely with the reindeer. Reindeer herding is a traditional Sámi activity.
“Some of the beautiful costumes in the film took inspiration from our gákti. They also took inspiration from the guksi, our traditional wooden cup,” said Anne Lajla Utsi, a member of a Sámi advisory group that collaborated with the filmmakers.
“We felt they really listened and that it was very important to them to do this right,” Utsi, managing director of the International Sámi Film Institute, told Reuters.
Disney signed a contract with Sámi representatives to commit themselves to portray their culture respectfully. That included supporting the dubbing of the movie in North Sámi, the most spoken of the Sámi languages, and release it at the same time as the Norwegian version.
When Utsi posted a picture of the “Frozen 2” poster on Facebook with its Sámi title, “Jikŋon 2”, it went viral.
“My youngest daughter is really looking forward to watching the movie again in her language,” said Keskitalo.
“My elder daughters, who are 22 and 25 years old, are also very excited about seeing the movie. It is not often that we see a movie in North Sámi. I think a lot of adults will see the movie too.” (

85,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/k-pop-singer-sentenced-to-6-years-in-jail-for-rape-sharing-secret-sex-videos/,"SEOUL: A South Korean court sentenced a K-pop musician to six years in prison on Friday for raping a woman and distributing a video capturing the act in a case that drew attention to the darker side of the country’s lucrative entertainment industry.
Jung Joon-young, 30, was arrested in March. Choi Jong-hoon, 30, a former member of South Korean boy band FT Island, was also sentenced to five years in prison for the rape of the woman.
Both were members of online chat groups that shared secret sex tapes and made jokes about drugging and raping women, the Seoul Central District Court said.
Jung’s conviction also includes the illegal distribution of other videos he took secretly while having sex with women. The identities of the victims were suppressed to protect their privacy.
The court also sentenced each man to 80 hours in “sexual violence treatment” education.
“The defendants are well-known celebrities and friends, but the chat they’ve had showed that they simply considered women as objects of sexual pleasure, and committed crimes that were extremely serious,” Judge Kang Seong-soo said as he handed down the verdict.
“Strict punishment is inevitable as the damage inflicted has not properly been recovered and the victims demand harsh penalties.”
Jung admitted distributing the video and others he took, though he argued the sex was in all cases consensual. Choi denied raping the woman, and had argued that he did not remember having sex with her and that if he had, it was likely consensual.
Lawyers for Jung and Choi could not be reached for comment.
Their case was one of several scandals involving sex crimes and other illegal activity that revealed a dark side of an industry at the centre of the global K-pop craze.
Lee Seung-hyun, a former member of K-pop group Big Bang better known by the stage name Seungri, is also on trial over accusations he paid for prostitutes for foreign businessmen to drum up investment in his business.

HONG KONG: Taiwanese-Canadian model-actor Godfrey Gao has died after suffering an apparent heart attack while on set in China.
Gao was filming a sports reality show in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo on Wednesday when he died. His agency, JetStar Entertainment, confirmed his death on its official Facebook page.
The 35-year-old was filming “Chase Me,” a Chinese variety series, when he reportedly fell while running. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to his agency.
The Taiwan-born Gao initially rose to fame by becoming the first Asian male model for the luxury brand Louis Vuitton. He acted in numerous television dramas and movies, including a role in the Hollywood film “The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.”
His body will be transported Wednesday to Taipei, Taiwan’s capital.

87,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/singer-goo-haras-death-shines-light-on-dark-side-of-k-pop/,"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA: The death of South Korean singer and actress Goo Hara, whose body was found at her home in Seoul this week, has again shone a spotlight on pressures that stars, especially females, face in the cutthroat K-pop industry and in deeply conservative South Korean society.
Goo’s death at age 28 came less than two months after the death of Choi Jin-ri, or Sulli, another K-pop star and Goo’s close friend. Experts say both Goo and Choi faced extensive cyberbullying and sexual harassment from the public and media throughout their careers, which took a toll on their mental health.

Police say they are still investigating Goo’s death and found a “pessimistic note” at her home.
Once popular mostly in Asia, K-pop has spread far beyond South Korea, thanks to wildly popular groups such as “BTS” and “Blackpink.”
Goo debuted in 2008 as part of the five-member girl group Kara, which shot almost immediately to fame and helped pioneer the K-pop global phenomenon.
She later launched a successful solo career in South Korea and Japan.
Sulli began her career around the same time as Goo, debuting as a member of the girl band f(x) in 2009. She also had multiple acting roles after stepping away from her singing career.
Goo made headlines when she took her former boyfriend, Choi Jong-bum, to court last year. Choi claimed to have been assaulted by her, while Goo accused him of threatening to release a sex video of her.
During the dispute, Goo’s Korean agency didn’t renew her contract. A court sentenced Choi to 1 ½ years in prison on charges of coercion and assaulting and blackmailing Goo. The jail term was suspended, keeping him out of prison. Choi appealed and the trial is still ongoing.
K-pop is highly competitive, with dozens of groups debuting each year. Industry experts have long warned about the dark side of the scandal-ridden industry. Aspiring artists, as young as their early teens, train for years. Only a few debuts and even fewer are commercially successful. The likelihood of their success increases if they sign with a handful of top entertainment agencies.
The industry is known to have strict rules for their stars — including dating bans, spartan training and diets, and sometimes slave-like and unfair contracts. Experts say the industry has additional requirements for its female artists, unspoken rules reflective of South Korea’s patriarchal society.
Park Hee-A, a K-pop journalist and writer of “Interviews with K-pop Stars,” said female stars are bound by rigid societal rules of femininity.
“Some female idol members have gotten ostracized for not smiling in a television show and reading a book about feminism that contradicts male-dominated patriarchal South Korean society,” Park told The Associated Press.
Expectations of purity and chastity govern women in South Korea. Goo faced a barrage of hate comments following media reports about the sex video despite her being the victim of revenge porn.
“The topic of sex is taboo in South Korea compared to western countries,” said Tae-Sung Yeum, attending psychiatrist at Gwanghwamun Forest Psychiatric Clinic. “There’s a high moral standard required, especially for female celebrities, because South Korea is a patriarchal society.”
Sulli, Goo’s long-time friend, also made headlines, often malicious and misogynistic, for speaking out about subjects such as ageism and feminism. She was criticized for wearing shirts without a bra, calling older male colleagues by their first names and openly supporting feminism.
Yeum said it’s difficult for K-pop stars to seek professional help for depression, especially in a country where many people believe that psychiatric disorders can be “treated with one’s will.” He said multiple suicides in the industry stem from stars being plunged into a hypercompetitive system with a plethora of abuses from a young age.
When Sulli was found dead in her Seongnam home, Goo bid farewell to her friend in a live-streamed video. “I will live more diligently for you,” Goo cried while apologizing for not being able to make it to her funeral.
Two days before Goo’s death, she uploaded a final selfie on her Instagram with the caption, “Good night.”

At the end of a year that saw musicians like Niall Horan and Ed Sheeran gingerly dip their toes into other languages, Coldplay have responded: Hold my European beer.
Their new album, “Everyday Life,” is so utterly embracing of the world that has words spoken or sung in Arabic, Spanish, Zulu and Igbo, and even a French verse sung by lead singer Chris Martin.
This cover image released by Parlophone/Atlantic shows “Everyday Life,” a release by Coldplay. Photo: Parlophone/Atlantic via AP
It’s a fluid and experimental 53-minute double album, divided into two halves, Sunrise and Sunset. If on 2015’s “A Head Full of Dreams,” the band sampled the likes of Barack Obama and a Rumi poem, now they’re doubling down.
“Everyday Life” is bursting with idiosyncratic references, ranging from the film “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” to a Bob Dylan lyric, a novel by Khaled Hosseini, audio of a bullying traffic stop by a cop in Philadelphia, an elegy to Africa, samples from Nigerian composer Harcourt Whyte and jazz legend Alice Coltrane, the South African activist song “Jikelele” and an exuberant tune about Syrian refugees (“Orphans,” which features a credit for Martin’s teenage son, Moses).
“Orphans” is really the only traditional-sounding Coldplay song. The others are often subdued, instrumental or undercooked. “I haven’t finished this one yet” say the liner notes on the stripped-down and fragmentary “WOTW/POTP.” It’s an astonishing, unsafe step from a band who could have just kept giving us “Something Like This.”
There are ambient sounds and snippets from films, including the documentaries “Everything Is Incredible” and “Fela Kuti: Music is the Weapon.” The band even seems to reference themselves (“Boom bo-boom boom” from “X Marks the Spot.”) Sometimes it feels less than an album and more like a multimedia project.
Fans will find that, sonically, the band has stepped off the dance floor. The new music is less bombastic and more intimate. “Old Friends” is a mournful ode to loss, while “Daddy” is sung from the heartbreaking perspective of an abandoned child. “Daddy are you OK?/Look dad we got the same hair.” There’s even spots of gospel and funk-jazz.
The band is also playing with time, with lyrics and credits seemingly created on an old typewriter and offering old timey band portraits that recall those famous shots of The Band.
There are also political songs — the menacing “Trouble in Town” and the sarcastic “Guns” — but most of the album is about faith — all faiths, from East Asian Buddhism to Pakistani Sufism.
It begins with a prayer in “Church” — “Oh, Father, God Almighty, why have you forsaken me?” — and ends 15 songs later with a soft thanksgiving Hallelujah, thanks to the gentle title track’s earnest plea for peace (sounding not unlike something from “Parachutes”)
“How in the world am I going to see/You as my brother not my enemy,” Martin sings. “Got to keep dancing when the lights go out.” In response to an ailing world, Coldplay are opening their arms wide and refusing to stop believing.

90,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/leonard-cohens-posthumous-album-centres-on-poetry/,"Leonard Cohen, “Thanks for the Dance” (Columbia/Legacy Recordings)
Leonard Cohen’s last album, released just weeks before he passed in 2016, was “You Want It Darker,” which had a sense of finality that made it a fine conclusion to his brilliant musical career.
“Thanks for the Dance,” on the other hand, seems to bring down the curtain on Cohen’s parallel universe, the poetry he started to publish long before he began making records.
Illustrating the point, the new nine-track set is more like a Cohen spoken-word performance with very good and empathetic musical backing, most of it composed by his son, Adam.
Understated exceptions are the title track and a few lines here and there, but Cohen doesn’t really sing, not that his resonant voice needs a melody to convey the experience, depth, humour, horror and beauty of his lyrics.
Expanding on recordings made mostly at the same time as the sessions for “You Want It Darker,” Adam Cohen and engineer/mixer Michael Chaves searched out some of the master’s previous collaborators and some new ones to complete the compositions. Among them are Sharon Robinson, Jennifer Warnes, the Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue Choir, Beck, Daniel Lanois, Feist, Javier Mas, Zac Rae, Patrick Leonard and Anjani Thomas.
“Happens to the Heart” opens the album with haunting guitar, laud and piano supporting Cohen’s listing of a life’s worth of experiences, the gentle accompaniment from Andre de Ridder’s stargaze orchestra making the lines even more effective — “I was always working steady/But I never called it art.”
The title track could be a sequel to “Take This Waltz,” a 1980s song with lyrics Cohen adapted from a poem by Federico García Lorca. Here the themes appear to be more personal but just as inspired.
Other highlights include the subtle flamenco airs of “The Night of Santiago,” the dark-as-night and terrifying “Puppets” and closer “Listen to the Hummingbird,” a short but wise and emotional epilogue.
“Thanks for the Dance” is like discovering a box of old letters — or in this case, poems — from a departed loved one. It’s an emotional experience that allows Cohen’s great talents to be appreciated again.

As the show went on, band’s lead singer Amrit Gurung performed their upcoming new song Naina Tala, a song sung by Nepali Gorkha army, who served during the British occupation of India. The song traversed through other British Gurkha regiments around the world and came to the Nepali settlement.

“I had been hearing this song since my childhood from the retired Gorkhali Lahure uncles,” Amrit Gurung shared explaining the roots of the song.
“We are glad to see people from all walks of life and age come together to celebrate Nepali music with us,” Gurung, band’s lead singer and social activist said.
The Brisbane show was organised by Mount 8848 Events and the Australia tour is coordinated by Sydney based Nepali Touch. After successfully performing in Brisbane, the band heads to Adelaide where they will rock the audience on November 22.
As usual, Amrit Gurung is accompanied on stage by Dhruba Lama on drums, Suraj Thapa on keyboards, Niraj Gurung on guitars, Subin Shakya on bass guitar and Shanti Raimajhi on madal.

NEW YORK: Singer Ariana Grande is telling her fans that she has a bad sinus condition that has made her “very sick” and might force her to cancel upcoming shows on her world tour.
Grande, 26, says in videos posted Saturday on Instagram that “my throat and head are still in so much pain.”
While she sounds OK, “I’m just in a lot of pain and it’s difficult to breathe during the show,” she says in a message to her fans. “I just really don’t know what’s happening with my body right now and need to figure it out.”
Grande says she plans to see a doctor soon.
She adds: “I’m scared that I might have to cancel some things, so this is kind just a heads up of like I don’t know what’s happening with my body, and I’m really disappointed and freaked out of why I can’t get better because it’s been over three weeks at this point.”
People magazine first reported on Grande’s Instagram videos.

94,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/joker-expected-to-cross-1-billion-global-box-office-milestone/,"Comic book movie “Joker” is poised to surpass $1 billion in global ticket sales on Friday, becoming the first R-rated Hollywood movie ever to overcome the milestone.
“Joker,” a dark origin story from Warner Bros about Batman’s arch nemesis, had sold $999.1 billion as of Thursday despite not having been screened in China, which is projected to become the world’s largest movie market next year.
Starring Joaquin Phoenix as a mentally-ill loner who finds fame through a random act of violence, the movie earned warm reviews as it opened in early October but stoked controversy in the United States over fears it would encourage violence.



Box office analyst Gitesh Pandya said “Joker” would top the $1 billion level on Friday.


“Absolutely jaw-dropping achievement for an R-rated film with a moderate budget and no China release,” Pandya, founder and editor of Box Office Guru, wrote on Twitter.
Its nearest R-rated rivals are 2018 movie “Deadpool 2” ($785 million) and 2016’s “Deadpool” ($783 million), both starring Ryan Reynolds as a foul-mouthed superhero.



Thanks to a modest production budget estimated at about $60 million, “Joker” is also the most profitable comic book movie ever, according to Forbes.com, due largely to the film’s focus on character rather than special effects and action scenes.



“Joker” is now the 7th biggest Hollywood movie at the 2019 box office, behind action-packed blockbuster “Avengers: Endgame” at $2.8 billion and family movie “The Lion King” at $1.6 billion, both from Walt Disney.
The movie is expected to land nominations in the upcoming Hollywood awards season and has inspired fans to visit the spot in New York’s Bronx district where Phoenix’s character transforms into the Joker, his face painted like a clown and with green hair, and dances triumphantly down a set of steep steps.

96,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/disney-plus-adds-disclaimer-about-racist-movie-stereotypes/,"NEW YORK: Disney’s new streaming service has added a disclaimer to “Dumbo,” “Peter Pan” and other classics because they depict racist stereotypes, underscoring a challenge media companies face when they resurrect older movies in modern times.
The move comes as Disney Plus seems to be an instant hit. It attracted 10 million subscribers in just one day. The disclaimer reads, “This program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.”
Companies have been grappling for years with how to address stereotypes that were in TV shows and movies decades ago but look jarring today. Streaming brings the problem to the fore.
In “Dumbo,” from 1941, crows that help Dumbo learn to fly are depicted with exaggerated black stereotypical voices. The lead crow’s name is “Jim Crow,” a term that describes a set of laws that legalized segregation. In “Peter Pan,” from 1953, Native American characters are caricatured. Other Disney movies with the disclaimer include “The Jungle Book” and “Swiss Family Robinson.”
“Pocahontas” and “Aladdin” do not have it, despite rumblings by some that those films contain stereotypes, too.
On personal computers, the disclaimer appears as part of the text description of shows and movies underneath the video player. It’s less prominent on a cellphone’s smaller screen. Viewers are instructed to tap on a “details” tab for an “advisory.”
Disney’s disclaimer echoes what other media companies have done in response to problematic videos, but many people are calling on Disney to do more.
The company “needs to follow through in making a more robust statement that this was wrong, and these depictions were wrong,” said Psyche Williams-Forson, chairwoman of American studies at the University of Maryland at College Park. “Yes, we’re at a different time, but we’re also not at a different time.”
She said it is important that the images are shown rather than deleted, because viewers should be encouraged to talk with their children and others about the videos and their part in our cultural history.
Disney’s disclaimer is a good way to begin discussion about the larger issue of racism that is embedded in our cultural history, said Gayle Wald, American studies chairwoman at George Washington University.
“Our cultural patrimony in the end is deeply tethered to our histories of racism, our histories of colonialism and our histories of sexism, so in that sense it helps to open up questions,” she said.
Wald said Disney is “the most culturally iconic and well-known purveyor of this sort of narrative and imagery,” but it’s by no means alone.
Universal Pictures’ teen comedy “Sixteen Candles” has long been decried for stereotyping Asians with its “Long Duk Dong” character.
Warner Bros. faced a similar problem with its “Tom and Jerry” cartoons that are available for streaming. Some of the cartoons now carry a disclaimer as well, but it goes further than Disney’s statement.
Rather than refer to vague “cultural depictions,” the Warner Bros. statement calls its own cartoons out for “ethnic and racial prejudices.”
“While these cartoons do not represent today’s society, they are being presented as they were originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed,” the statement reads.
At times, Disney has disavowed a movie entirely.
“Song of the South,” from 1946, which won an Oscar for the song “Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,” was never released for home video and hasn’t been shown theatrically for decades, due to its racist representation of the plantation worker Uncle Remus and other characters. It isn’t included in Disney Plus, either.
Disney and Warner Bros did not respond to requests for comment.
Sonny Skyhawk, an actor and producer who created the group American Indians in Film and Television, found the two-sentence disclaimer lacking.
What would serve minority groups better than any disclaimer is simply offering them opportunities to tell their own stories on a platform like Disney Plus, Skyhawk said. He said that when he talks to young Indian kids, “the biggest negative is they don’t see themselves represented in America.”

97,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/the-crown-welcomes-its-new-royals-in-season-3-launch/,"LONDON: Television fans welcomed a new queen on Wednesday as Olivia Colman and other stars of royal drama “The Crown” turned out for the world premiere of the Netflix show’s third season.
Colman, who won an Oscar earlier this year for playing a different royal in dark comedy “The Favourite,” portrays Queen Elizabeth in a retelling of the life of Britain’s reigning monarch. Colman replaces Claire Foy, who won a Golden Globe for the role as a younger version of Elizabeth.
The show’s third season, arriving on Netflix on Sunday, picks up the story in the mid-1960s going through to 1977, as heir to the throne Prince Charles (Josh O’Connor) comes of age and Britain goes through a pop culture revolution led by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.

Creator Peter Morgan has said the series, whose first two seasons cost about $130 million to make, is based on known facts and imagined private conversations.



Helena Bonham Carter, who takes on Elizabeth’s younger sister Princess Margaret, said she was a joy to play.



“The hardest thing about playing Margaret or anybody of the family is that ultimately so many people feel they know her. And everyone has an opinion,” Bonham Carter told Reuters Television on the red carpet.
“There were so many really close friends that were all too happy to talk about her and wanted to and really loved her and also wanted to show the side that was less known about her – that she was funny, that she was full of warmth and that she was very multicolored,” the actress said.
Erin Doherty, who plays second-born child Princess Anne, said that working on the series had made her more sympathetic to the royal family.


“After doing this show, I feel like I understand them a lot more and I really, really value them and I have a lot of empathy for them,” Doherty said.


Asked whether he thought the royal family watched the show, Tobias Menzies, who plays the queen’s husband Prince Philip in middle age, said he doubted it.
“It makes me a bit nervous imagining them watching it. I’d be amazed if they watch it, but maybe they do…. My money is that they probably don’t,” he said.

NEW YORK: Stocks ended slightly higher on Friday, helped by better-than-expected quarterly results from Google’s parent Alphabet and retailer Amazon and a modest recovery in oil prices.
However, the gains were held back by disappointing results from Exxon Mobil as well as news out of the Bank of Japan, which did not announce as much stimulus as many had hoped.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 24.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,432.24.
The Dow was held back partly by a drop in the oil giant Exxon Mobil. The company reported its smallest quarterly profit in 17 years, well below what analysts were looking for, due to the continuing weakness in oil prices. Its major competitor, Chevron, fared slightly better. While earnings dropped sharply from a year ago, Chevron’s results still beat analysts’ expectations.
Exxon fell $1.25, or 1.4 percent, to $88.95. Chevron climbed 69 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $102.48 after being down earlier in the day.
Broader market indicators ended higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,173.60 and the Nasdaq composite increased 7.15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,162.13.
Wall Street is finishing out its busiest week of corporate earnings, which was dominated by mostly strong results from technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and others.
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped $25.50, or 3.3 percent, to $791.34. The company reported earnings of $8.42 a share, well above the $8.04 that analysts were looking for.
Amazon rose $6.20, or 1 percent, to $758.81. The online retail giant reported a profit of $1.78 per share, well above the $1.11 a share that analysts expected. Amazon reported it sold $30.4 billion in goods in the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier.
The strong results from Amazon and Google, as well as the results from other tech companies, helped lift the technology-heavy Nasdaq 1.2 percent this week, while the Dow lost 0.8 percent. The S&P 500 closed the week down slightly. It was the first weekly loss for the S&P 500 after four weeks of gains.
So far, corporate profits appear to be coming well ahead of what were very low expectations. Earnings in the S&P 500 so far are down 2.4 percent from a year ago, which is better than the 5.2 percent decline expected when earnings season started, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“Expectations were exceptionally low for the second quarter. While consumers goods and technology has been better than expected, the energy sector continues to show challenges,” said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock.
Investors remain cautious, however. The run-up earlier this month made stocks more expensive than investors are historically comfortable with. The S&P 500 is trading at 18.5 times its expected earnings for the next year, noticeable above the 12-14 times investors typically look for.
The presidential election will continue to grow as an issue for markets in the next several months. Investors dislike uncertainty, and the unexpectedly close presidential election and mostly unknown policies of Donald Trump puts them on edge.
Next week another fifth of the S&P 500 will report their results, including Proctor & Gamble, General Motors, Kraft Heinz, 21st Century Fox and Allstate, among many others.
Moore also pointed out the July jobs report, released August 5, will give investors direction since the June and May jobs reports showed two clashing directions for the US economy.
Japan’s central bank ended a policy meeting Friday by announcing it will expand purchases of exchange traded funds from financial institutions to help inject more cash into the world’s third-largest economy and pursue its 2 percent inflation target. But the measures fell short of hopes for more aggressive action. That helped the yen surge as investors priced in fewer yen in circulation. The dollar dropped to 102.03 yen from 105.45 yen.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury note falling to 1.46 percent from 1.51 percent the day before.
In energy trading, benchmark US crude reversed earlier losses and was up 46 cents to close at $41.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 24 cents to $42.46 a barrel in London.
Heating oil rose less than 1 cent to $1.28 a gallon, wholesale gasoline futures rose 1 cent to $1.32 a gallon and natural gas fell was little changed at $2.88 per thousand cubic feet.
In other currencies, the euro rose to $1.1179 from $1.1073 the day before and the British pound rose to $1.3239 from $1.3148.
The price of gold closed up $16.70 to $1,349 an ounce, silver rose 16 cents to $20.31 an ounce and copper rose a penny to $2.222 a pound.

NEW YORK: Five years after United Airlines and Continental merged, the company’s new CEO declared in a public letter that the combined company has failed to live up to the expectations of both fliers and United’s employees.
Just three weeks into the job, CEO Oscar Munoz acknowledged in full-page newspaper ads that “the journey hasn’t always been smooth.”
Since the merger, United has been plagued with chronic delays, computer outages and dissatisfied workers, who have a reputation for taking out their frustrations on fliers. The problems overshadowed the tenure of former CEO Jeff Smisek, who took over the combined airline when the merger closed on Oct. 1, 2009.
On Sept. 8, Chicago-based United Continental Holdings said Smisek was ousted following an internal investigation into the airline’s dealing with the public agency that operates its hub airport in Newark, New Jersey. That agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is part of a federal investigation into abuse of power. Munoz, a railroad executive and head of United’s audit committee, was named president and CEO.
In his letter, which ran in national newspapers, Munoz didn’t offer any hints as to how he will actually fix United’s many problems except that he will listen to fliers and employees.
“We are committed to re-earning your trust,” he wrote.
The company set up a website, UnitedAirtime.com, for people to ask questions and provide feedback to the airline. The airline posted a few questions and answers in advance of the site’s launch that focus on delayed luggage delivery, aging airplanes that lack Wi-Fi or working TVs and the poor quality of first-class meals.
“Let’s be honest, the implementation of the United and Continental merger has been rocky for customers and employees,” Munoz says on a video greeting on the site. “While it’s been improving recently, we still haven’t lived up to our promise or our potential.”

WASHINGTON: US manufacturers expanded at their slowest pace in two years last month, held back by faltering global growth and cutbacks in oil and gas drilling.
The Institute for Supply Management says its index of factory activity fell sharply to 50.2 in September from 51.1 in August. That is the lowest level since May 2013. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders and production both fell sharply and a measure of hiring also declined, according to the ISM, a trade group of purchasing managers. All three still barely remained in expansion territory.
US manufacturers are getting hit by slower growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy, and a stronger dollar, which makes US goods more expensive overseas. Oil and gas drillers are also cutting back on their orders for steel pipe and other goods in the wake of sharply lower oil prices.
China’s factory activity contracted last month, according to a survey of its purchasing managers, though its manufacturing index inched up to 49.8 from 49.7 in August.
Manufacturers cut 15,000 jobs last month, the most in five years, payroll services provider ADP said Wednesday. The government will release its jobs report Friday, and economists forecast it will show that the economy added 206,000 jobs overall.
The unemployment rate is expected to remain at a seven-year low of 5.1 percent.
Most economists expect US manufacturing will do little for the economy for the rest of the year, with the possible exception of automakers. But so far, healthy consumer spending on cars, homes and restaurant meals is offsetting overseas weakness and driving modest growth.

Are we utilising resources to the best of our ability?
As Shahrukh Khan stated in the blockbuster film, ‘Chennai Express’ — “Don’t underestimate the power of a common man”, the financial markets can deliver the same phrase with a twist. Don’t underestimate the power of information! In the age of technology and information, the world of traders has been enveloped by numerous data and reports. Life, as the traders know it, has been surrounded by scores of data emancipating from various economies and every second matters in the race towards accomplishing profits. With the passage of time, global markets have provided innovative ways to look at the markets and the fundamentals within it. Given that global markets are operating 24 hours a day and five days a week, inevitably investors will enhance their knowledge levels.
In recent times, during market operation, information does stem out from every corner of the globe with astounding pace that traders need to keep an eye on every major economy around the globe. Given the markets is a convergent point for the constant flow of information, investors should weigh the data and incorporate the ones which one feels will be imperative to his trading strategies. Easier said than done, the preceding sentence might leave some readers with a raised eyebrow and an immediate question — how do I weigh the information or how can I know the importance of such information?
In the first few trades, it is important to follow the impact of such information and wait to enact on the appropriate trade. With experience, the trader will learn the importance of such information and incorporate similar strategies in the ensuing days too.
But given the importance of the word ‘information’, are we utilising resources to the best of our abilities? Having undertaken numerous training classes related to the markets, I have noticed that participants have not been keeping themselves updated with the latest developments from around the globe. It is next to impossible to throw the dart expecting to find the bull’s eye when darkness has clouded the room. However, with light, the task of finding the bull’s eye becomes a tad easier. Information is the light, guiding traders and making the process of trading more effective.
A mentor once said — “information from the markets, if interpreted and processed in the right manner, will always reap greater results in the forthcoming days.” In contemporary times, processing the given information is a major challenge for the prevailing investors. In theory, trading seems easier but when theory has to be converted into practice, life does not seem to be easy. However, with experience and practice, one will surely master the art of trading from the given processed information. Hence, information is the most important commodity in today’s global financial world.

FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

A recent high school graduate, she wants to pursue Biomedical engineering in her undergraduate studies. Head strong about her goals, she leaves no opportunities behind to achieve them.
When EmpowHER came around, she knew what she needed to do. The idea of sharing the same platform with other like-minded women and learning new things excited her. She joined EmpowHER with a hope to improve her leadership skills, and bring back her experience and understandings to her students.
She has been working as a teacher since the last three years at a women’s school in her neighbourhood. Many of her students work as domestic helpers in dif ferent houses in the community. In exchange for school fees, many young women from rural Nepal travel to the capital to work as domestic helpers. Despite mistreatment and abuse, these girls stay with their host families so that they can receive free schooling. But most of them do not even get to go to school, and even if they do they cannot concentrate and lag behind in their classes due to over workload. Therefore, through her EmpowHER ‘Impact Service Project’ Martina will provide free coaching classes to help these girls with their assignments and class works including sessions on ESL, mathematics, and computer courses. Based on their performance in the coaching classes, she will provide
scholarships to few students to support their tuition fees. She hopes her effort will
help at least few young women to pursue education without being forced into domestic labour.

She wants to pilot her project in Mashfal VDC in Dolpa, where many women have lost their lives to Chaupadi. With the help of her project, she will be providing awareness trainings in the community to help women overcome the social pressure to practice such traditions, and establish an understanding of menstruation as a biological process rather than a regressive social practice. She will also provide trainings on women health and how women can take care of themselves while they are menstruating. She hopes that her efforts will help the community gain a different perspective on women menstruation, leading to both behavioral and social change towards such practices.
She joined EmpowHER to empower herself so that she can enable other women in the community. Through EmpowHER she has been able to strengthen her interpersonal skills, better herself as a leader, and develop ever lasting sisterhood.
As the journey of EmpowHER progresses, we see the passion, focus, and the sense of responsibility towards the community brewing strongly in our participants. We are confident that these change makers will leave no stones unturned to make a powerful impact anywhere they go.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

105,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

106,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

107,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/trade-with-confidence/,"IT IS SEEN THAT TRADERS FOCUS ON RESULTS RATHER THAN PROCESS

KATHMANDU: Trade outcomes cannot be assured. The market might be predicted up to some level but its result is uncertain. You entered a market with full preparation to come out successful and it happened to be same as predicted but it can be the other way too; you entered a market with full study and analysis and relied on probabilities to come out successful but it had an unexpected outcome. The nature of trading is like that. Due to its nature and effect on the psyche of human being, it is essential to have a lot of self-confidence.
Self-confidence is an element which is required in every field to excel. Without this underlying competence, a person cannot grow and be ahead. It is rightly said that ‘Without confidence, we can do little in life. With it, we can change the world’. Confidence is a tool which when used in trading can have a positive impact and help to improve the performance thereon. Self-confidence in trading is the ability to focus on improvement and better performance thereby keeping self away from negative thought patterns like fear, greed, anxiety, et cetera.

Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade

Many traders have the misconception that winning trades develop confidence but the fact is just the opposite. More winning trades come from a dedicated focus on the process of trading where traders develop their skills and in doing so, develop their confidence. Focus on the process of trading is very important but very often, it is seen that traders focus on results rather than process. Soon if a trader sees a loss or two in a strategy they attempted, they will discard the strategy. This attitude leads only to frustration. So, in the phase of trading it is quite important to understand how we learn. Learning does not start at point A and steadily progress to point B; it is not a linear. Learning occurs in a series of ups and downs. We grow a little, fall back a bit, advance some more, take breaks and this is how it goes.
Other thing which leads to confidence development is positive thoughts. Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade. They don’t have a negative outlook. Rather they are quite optimistic and try to learn from their mistakes. It is said that positive outlook brings out positive result and the same applies to trading too. So instead of burdenning your mind with negative thoughts and wasting your time, be positive and think of how you can plan your trade better and follow it properly.
Develop self-confidence and you will see a better performance in your trade!

108,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/entrepreneur-juggler/,"“START SMALL, REALLY SMALL. TEST YOUR BUSINESS MODEL BEFORE YOU REACH OUT TO THE MASS.”

KATHMANDU: Amun Thapa, 27, owner/co-owner of five companies combined suggests that he is an ‘entrepreneur juggler’. When asked what it means, he states, “Someone who is constantly juggling between several ventures. At present, I manage Sasto Deal, Sasto Book, Irish Pub, Chhahari Production and Anthropose. A few other interesting projects are in the pipeline.”
Before asking him how he manages to look after all of these, I was curious to know where he started. Amun, I discovered, sees things in black and white without much grey areas. “For any problem, there are two approaches — to complain or to seek for solutions. I have always taken the latter approach. I never intended to become an entrepreneur. But the problems I personally faced in Nepal and elsewhere got me to come up with solutions, and hence the businesses I am involved with,” he shares. He says that getting where he is today was not an easy task. In his own words, “The first and foremost hurdle, when starting a business, is to understand the local legal and tax systems. Nepali entrepreneurs still do not have a clear understanding of how they should go about when it comes to taxation. It is a shame but also a reality that most businesses operate without proper registration and billings. This makes it difficult for other businesses to work. Also, finding the right employees is another major challenge here, apart from building culture.”
Amun shares that getting investment for a start-up in Nepal was a daunting task. He blames the regulations set by the Central Bank for Foreign Direct Investment and suggests that the easiest route is to seek for investment among friends and family. With profit margins depending on the venture/start-up, Amun says that the first year of the start-up, he did not care much about the profit margin but diverted their efforts in generating brand awareness. He shares, “This is when the advertisement costs are at their maximum. But to put it in numbers, a venture must seek at least 10 per cent to 40 per cent profit margin for it to be sustainable and scalable.”
On employees he says, “The smartest thing to do is ignore the resume because it tells nothing about an employee. We hire them on the basis of their performance during their internship period (which usually lasts for two months). Most of them come through referrals. We also have performance incentives to encourage employees to work at their level best. As for salaries, I believe everyone deserves to be paid well, like the saying goes — if you look after your employees, they will look after your clients.” He opines that he would definitely focus more on technology if he had the chance to start over again. “Over the past four years I have witnessed consumers adapting to changes in technology. People have taken to Facebook and Viber for communication, apps are replacing websites, and such. I was talking to a hotel owner in Pokhara yesterday and he told me, one of the first things people ask for after checking-in is the WiFi password.”
When asked about the Nepal’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, Amun says diversification is the key. “Nepal is now not only relying on tourism and hydropower and banking industries as income generating businesses but there are a lot more new industries that were introduced to the market in the past several years. Therefore, we are definitely on the right track.” His words of wisdom for the ones starting out are, “Start small, really small.
Test your business model before you reach out to the mass. Focus on building systems because this comes in handy when you are scaling your businesses. And always give priority to your brand because revenues can go up and down but your brand is what keeps you going.”

European telecoms group Altice will become a major force in the lucrative US cable market after it agreed to buy fourth-largest operator Cable vision for a mix of cash and shares in a deal worth USD 17.7 billion including debt.
The move is the latest foray by French-Israeli billionaire and Altice founder Patrick Drahi, who built a telecoms and cable empire in recent years via debt-fueled acquisitions in France, Portugal and Israel.Drahi entered the United States in May by buying small regional cable group Suddenlink for USD 9.1 billion and had declared he would do more acquisitions so as eventually to earn half of Altice’s revenue there.
GM to pay USD 900 million settles US criminal case
General Motors Co (GM.N) has agreed to pay USD 900 million and sign a deferred-prosecution agreement to end a US government investigation into its handling of an ignition-switch defect linked to 124 deaths, two sources told Reuters. The deal means GM will be charged criminally with hiding the defect from regulators and in the process defrauding consumers, but the case will be put on hold while GM fulfills terms of the deal, one source said. No individuals would be charged in the criminal case, one of the sources said. The company’s expected USD 900 million payment, confirmed by a second source, is less than the USD 1.2 billion that Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) paid to resolve a similar case.

Global stocks at three-week highs as Fed decision looms
World stocks inched to a three-week high on Thursday while the dollar drifted lower against other currencies, as investors consolidated positions ahead of a nail-biting US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. There was a sense of relief as much as anything that after months of market speculation and advice from almost everyone from the IMF to the heads of the world’s top companies, that the wait for the Fed’s verdict would be over by 1800 GMT. Europe’s main share markets were left at a virtual standstill with Britain’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 all barely budged after two days of gains helped by a flurry of merger activity.Currency and bond market moves were low key too.

AUSTRALIA

US Fed may not hike interest rates
The Australian share market has surged ahead of highly anticipated US Federal Reserve rates call, as energy stocks soar on a strong bounce in crude oil prices. Investors remain upbeat approaching the US Federal Reserve’s decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, with financial markets predicting a 30 per cent chance of lift-off. At the 4.15pm (AEST) official market close, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 added 47.9 points, or 0.94 per cent, to 5146.8 points, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 47.6 points, or 0.93 per cent, to 5171.2 points. The growing sense that the US Fed may not hike interest rates has also pushed the Australian dollar above US72c for the first time in three weeks as per The Australian.
Australian shares rose 1.5 per cent on Thursday for a second straight day of gains as all sectors rallied ahead of the US Fed’s interest rate decision later in the day. Banks and miners were among the clear winners with the “Big Four” lenders rising more than two percent in early trade. A jump in oil prices pushed energy stocks higher. The S&P/ASX 200 index added 73.83 points to 5,172.7 by 0215 GMT. The index closed 1.6 per cent higher on Wednesday, and is on track to post a second straight weekly gain. Analysts said the market could claw back some of the day’s gain as the near-month futures contract expires on Thursday and could add some volatility. Asian stocks hit a three-week high on Thursday after a jump in oil prices lifted Wall Street, with many investors taking last-minute positions ahead of the Fed’s policy decision.

BANGLADESH

Secretary of state for treasury ministry
According to The Daily Star, Poland is interested in investing in mining, coal extraction and installation of liquefied natural gas terminal in Bangladesh as the European country has experience in the sectors, a deputy minister said yesterday. Zdzislaw Gawlik, secretary of state for the treasury ministry, also said his country is keen to explore shell gas in Bangladesh. “We are bringing in very solid proposals of investment in Bangladesh,” he said. “I know Bangladesh is developing at a faster rate. So we are working at the government-to-government and business-to-business levels to intensify bilateral relationship.”
Tea prices in Bangladesh edged higher for a second straight week at the weekly auction on Tuesday amid tight supplies and strong demand for quality leaf. Bangladeshi tea fetched an average 187.93 taka (USD 2.4) per kg at the 19th auction of the current marketing season, slightly up from 185.81 taka at the previous week’s sale when the prices snapped seven-week losing streak, an executive with National Brokers said. There was huge demand for quality tea, while volume dropped again this week compared with last week, helping prices to perk up, the executive said. About 1.93 million kg was offered at the sole auction centre in Chittagong, of which 6.5 per cent was unsold. In the previous auction, about 10 per cent of the 2.17 million kg offered went unsold. The national budget for the 2015/16 fiscal year that started in July raised the regulatory duty on tea imports by five per cent to discourage overseas buying. Tea prices fell sharply in the last marketing season on poor demand from local buyers as business sentiment was hit by renewed political unrest early this year that left more than 120 people dead and disrupted supplies. The country, however, has moved from being a net exporter to a net importer of tea due to rising consumption.

CHINA

Activists rally ouside the White House
China’s economic powerhouse is slowing, destabilising global markets. Beijing’s neighbors, unnerved over its pursuit of territorial claims, are increasingly cosying up to Washington. A threat of US cyber sanctions looms over Chinese companies. It might seem an ideal time for US President Barack Obama to take advantage of Beijing’s troubles and get tough when he hosts Chinese leader Xi Jinping for a state visit on September 25. Obama is expected to press Xi on issues that have strained relations between the two countries, but his approach will be tempered because for better or worse the world’s two biggest economies are inextricably bound together. That will mean a difficult balancing act for Obama. He is under pressure to send a strong message to Xi over cyber spying, Chinese economic policies and South China Sea disputes, but he does not want to upend a summit that could set the tone for relations for his last 16 months in office.
Just as China shows that its domestic stock market can be something of a one-way street — investors can put money in, but not take money out — the biggest mutual fund company, Vanguard Group, is moving ahead with plans to expose more mom-and-pop investors to the country’s heavily restricted exchanges. With the Shanghai stock exchange down by 37 per cent and the Shenzhen exchange off by 43 per cent during the past three months, compared with just an 18 per cent drop on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, Vanguard is adding China mainland stocks to its USD 60 billion emerging markets fund in the coming year.Vanguard says adding A-shares — stocks that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, as opposed to those that trade on the Hong Kong exchange — will diversify the fund, but acknowledges they pose unique risks related to tracking a benchmark. Steps taken by the Chinese government to restrict trading on domestic exchanges make it difficult for index funds to buy the stocks they need to replicate the performance of Chinese benchmarks, fund executives said.

EUROPE

Nestle fails to convince European judges
According to The Guardian, Nestlé has failed in an attempt to convince European judges to let it trademark the shape of the four-finger version of a KitKat in the UK. The European court of justice ruled that the KitKat’s shape was not distinctive enough for consumers to associate it with the chocolate covered wafer. Nestlé is not seeking to trademark its two-fingered version of KitKat. Nestlé had argued that even without its red and white packaging or the word KitKat embossed on the chocolate, the shape of the bar should be regarded as distinct. The dispute between Nestlé and Cadbury, which has fought to prevent Nestlé securing a trademark, will go back to the UK high court for a final ruling that will determine whether rivals will be able to launch copycat KitKats in Britain.Despite the court’s failure to allow the trademark, Nestlé said it was pleased with the ruling.

INDIA

Reserve Bank of India headquaters, Mumbai
India requires sustained low inflation and a credible programme for fiscal rectitude to lower the cost of capital, Urjit Patel, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said on Thursday, striking a hawkish note after government calls for interest rate cuts to boost the economy. The central banker also said in a speech to a business conference that he expected India’s current account deficit to be 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product in the 2015/16 fiscal year. New banking licences issued by the RBI were also aimed at lowering the cost of capital, Patel said. His remarks addressed concerns that commercial banks have failed to pass on recent cuts in the RBI’s main policy rate to their borrowers.
India plans to address some pending tax disputes in the next few days, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday, but did not give details or say whether the cases in question included disputes with foreign companies that have spooked investors. Earlier this month, the finance ministry decided not to press claims for a Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) against foreign portfolio investors. India remains locked in major back-tax battles with telecoms group Vodafone (VOD.L) and Cairn Energy (CNE.L). Arun Jaitley said last week that the government was trying to resolve pending tax cases, many of them outside the courts.

Japan’s exports slowed for a second straight month in August in a worrying sign that China’s economic slowdown could deal a damaging blow to the world’s third-biggest economy and force policymakers to inject fresh stimulus before too long. The data joins a string of depressing shipment numbers in key regional economies — including South Korea and Taiwan — which has heightened anxiety over a China-led slowdown in global growth and tempered bets of the US Federal Reserve lifting rates for the first time in almost a decade later on Thursday.Slowing exports could increase the chance of additional monetary easing from the Bank of Japan, because this could lead to lower factory output, slack economic activity and less momentum needed to offset deflationary pressure caused by a collapse in oil prices.
Vietnam agreed with Japan on Tuesday to step up security cooperation, becoming the latest Southeast Asian country to seek closer ties with Tokyo as China maintains an assertive posture in disputed waters in the South China Sea. The agreement between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Vietnam’s Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong comes after a US expert said on Monday China appeared to be carrying out preparatory work for a third airstrip in contested territory in the South China Sea. China has overlapping claims with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei in the South China Sea. It is also embroiled in a row with Japan over a group of East China Sea islets. Earlier this year, Japan reached an agreement with Malaysia and the Philippines to strengthen security ties.

Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Thursday ahead of a likely policy move by the US Federal Reserve, with stocks in Malaysia outperforming and Singapore hitting a more than one-week high as a big jump in global oil prices boosted energy stocks. Oil prices jumped as much as six per cent on Wednesday after a US stock draw. Oil bulls were also encouraged by doubts on whether the Fed will decide to hike US interest rates on Thursday after tame August inflation data. Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur composite index was up 2.1 per cent on a rally in oil-related stocks. The index touched 1,691.93, a near six-week high, on resuming trade after a market holiday. Shares of oil and gas services firm Sapurakencana Petroleum Bhd was up seven per cent and Tenaga Nasional Bhd was 2.3 per cent higher, among top gainers.
While Malaysia’s premier faces tough questions over the origin of hundreds of millions of dollars transferred to his bank accounts, the country has tentatively received good grades for its anti-money laundering efforts from a team of international experts, documents reviewed by Reuters show. A draft report by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body which monitors how countries fight illicit financial flows, said Malaysia had put in place a “robust policy framework” to combat money laundering.But it said the Asian country needed to be more effective in targeting high-risk offences and needs to pay more attention to transnational crime. The draft, dated Aug 4 and marked for official use, said the FATF inspection team found the Malaysian government had a “strong political commitment and well functioning coordination structures” to fight money laundering and that “significant resources have been allocated” to investigations in this field.

RUSSIA

Launch of new Opel Astra to boost sales
General Motors (GM.N) executives said they remained committed to meeting their goal of reaching profitability in Europe by 2016, brushing aside concerns that a downturn in Russia could put their goal at risk. “We are confident about reaching our goal,” Opel Chief Executive Karl-Thomas Neumann told journalists at the Frankfurt auto show on Tuesday. In July, GM warned its European employees the Opel and Vauxhall brands were still posting significant losses, and meeting its goal of returning to profit by next year would be difficult given the crisis in Russia and the Euro Zone. But General Motors President Dan Ammann said on Tuesday the launch of a new Opel Astra would help boost sales.
Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc on Tuesday said it expected to complete its new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a soon-to-be banned Russian engine, but the date could slip if it does not receive enough US government funding. Aerojet Vice President Julie Van Kleeck declined comment on reports that Aerojet has offered USD two billion to acquire United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 rocket launch venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Analysts say the bid is a strategic move by Aerojet to shut out rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, that is developing a new engine favored by ULA for use in its new Vulcan rocket. ULA has said Blue Origin’s engine programme is about two years ahead of Aerojet’s work on the AR-1 engine, a claim Aerojet disputes.Work on the new engines gained urgency after US lawmakers passed a ban on use of Russian RD-180 engines for launches of US military or spy satellites following Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine last year.

PAKISTAN

Pakistan and Afghanistan have shelved a raft of agreements that promised to more than triple cross-border trade, officials said, as economic ties seen as key to regional stability fall victim to rivalry and suspicion. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani struck the trade deals with Pakistan soon after taking office last year as part of a broader rapprochement that included plans to share intelligence on Taliban insurgents active in both countries. That cooperation was aimed at tackling the Islamist militant movement, which has separate Afghan and Pakistani branches whose violent campaigns kill thousands of people each year and hamper much-needed development. The trade deals were supposed to be a step towards warmer relations and boosting Afghanistan-Pakistan trade from USD 1.6 billion now to USD five billion by 2017. But officials told Reuters that the agreements, which include reducing tariffs and granting each other preferential trade status, have stalled.
Pakistani farmers will receive USD 3.2 billion in grants, subsidies and loan advances from the government, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced on Tuesday, in a bid to spur sluggish growth in one of the country’s main economic sectors. The new schemes represent the government’s largest economic development programme for the agricultural sector since it was voted into office in 2013.The funds will be provided through immediate cash grants and subsidies on agricultural inputs worth USD 1.4 billion, while loan advances worth USD 1.85 billion will also be made and disbursements begin this year, he said. “The conditions of the agricultural sector do not inspire confidence,” Sharif said as he announced the new package at a farmers’ convention in Islamabad. The package includes immediate cash grants for rice and cotton farmers, cuts in fertiliser prices, and a government scheme to pay insurance premiums for farmers who cannot afford them.

THAILAND

TAC plan expansion of it 4G mobile network
Thailand’s Total Access Communication Pcl (TAC) said on Thursday it is planning a major expansion of its fourth generation (4G) mobile network, as it seeks to displace rivals Advanced Info Service Pcl and True Corp. The country’s second largest mobile operator, controlled by Norway’s Telenor, has received regulatory approval to provide 4G services on the 1800MHz frequency band, which is currently used for 2G, Chief Executive Officer Lars Norling told a news conference. TAC also plans to increase its number of base stations to 32,000 in early 2016 from 17,000 now, aiming to provide 4G network coverage nationwide.
The Asian Development Bank will lower its 2015 GDP growth forecast for Thailand from the current 2.9 to 3.0 per cent following weaker-than-expected performance in the first half, the Bangkok Post reported, citing Luxamon Attapich, the bank’s senior economist for Thailand.The new growth forecast, due to be announced on Sept 22, will be higher than 2.5 per cent, the paper reported.

USA

A women walks past the FR headquaters
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has made clear she would rather delay an interest rate hike for too long than move sooner and risk jeopardising a tepid economic recovery, a conviction that will face its sharpest test yet on Thursday. Having weighed the economy’s steady march toward full employment against the backdrop of weak inflation and wage growth and turbulence overseas, the US central bank will issue its latest rate decision at the end of a two-day policy meeting. A rate hike would be the first in the United States in nearly a decade. Fed watchers, however, see the outcome as a toss-up, with Yellen’s consistently stated desire to see workers reap more benefits from the recovery, coupled with weak price rises and a variety of global risks, looming large. “It is a game-time decision. The key is what Yellen thinks and my guess is that she will want to wait,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. “If you put yourself in her shoes, you don’t want to make a mistake by going too soon.”
Oil prices were stable on Thursday as a US stock draw tightened the market while Asia’s economies showed new signs of weakness.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading at USD 47.13 per barrel at 0430 GMT, virtually unchanged from their previous close, while Brent was up 6 cents at USD 49.81 per barrel. That followed a price jump of as much as six per cent in the previous session when data from the US Energy Information Administration showed the largest crude drawdown since February 2014 at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point. Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures said that the stock draw was “a result of higher refining activity and lower US crude production which is helping the US inventory glut to ease off”.

110,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

KATHMANDU
Traders are simply investing their time, thinking that if they spend a lot of time around the markets, analysing charts, reading books and studying courses, their skill level will improve. Investing time is necessary when you are starting out, as there is a lot to learn. But putting in hours will not necessarily increase your profit potential. If you always repeat the same mistakes, putting in hours will just be meaningless with those habits in place. To improve, make repeated and deliberate choices. Here are five things to start doing today to improve your trading performance.
GET HELP
Trading is tough and not a cup of tea for everyone especially when we go at it completely alone. So choose a person who could be just a friend or family member who you have told your plans to and who you keep updated on your performance. Share what you are doing, what you are struggling with and what you are having success with. Anyone can get side tracked, so be open to being told when you have gone astray. When your own discipline and self-awareness fails, you will have someone to help you get back on track.
FOLLOW YOUR PLAN
Talking about strategies with other traders or discussing your performance with your trading referee is fine, but avoid the opinions of others when it comes to specific trades. Trade your trading plan, your way. It doesn’t matter if a trader you respect says they are going to buy when your plan says to sell.
PRACTICE
A strategy may seem simple on the surface, but even a simple strategy is hard to implement in live market conditions. Every day, every trend, every pullback is slightly different; nothing looks exactly the same as it did in the textbook examples. So trade it in a demoaccount until you consistently see profit from it.
MENTAL CLARITY
Each day take one minute before you trade to make sure you are feeling clearheaded and focused. Also take a couple of seconds to reiterate that you’re here to trade, not check your social media accounts, email or watch videos online. When you trade, simply focus on trading and leave other matters. Check the economic calendar to be aware of events that may move the market, so you are not taken by surprise during the day. If you are angry, upset or unfocused, avoid trading. It only takes one day, one trade even, to lose an entire account when not in the right mind frame.
RECORD YOUR TRADE
Review every trade you make. Take screenshots of your trades with entries, stop loss levels, targets, and your technical/fundamental notes so you can easily review your trades at a later time.

KATHMANDU
Hear it verbatim from Rajesh KC on how he aspires to build a world-class Nepali brand.
“I have been drawing cartoons since 1990s. Back then they were limited to my friend’s portraits but once I got the platform, I was able to polish my skills and dedicate my time and energy to the same. It has been 25 years now and I recently expanded the skills I have to something new.”
On Phalano Luga: “Phalano Luga came to me as a pleasant surprise. A friend of mine who owned a t-shirt store asked me to design a few prints for t-shirts. While designing, I thought to myself, ‘He might give me royalty and I might make some money out of the designs but why not create a Nepali brand in itself?’ I visited stores for market evaluation and realised that even though Nepal has a lot of talent in terms of designs, the fabric was not up to the mark. Even though the t-shirts had tags that said, ‘100 per cent cotton’, something was amiss. Phalano Luga came into existence with an ambition of creating a Nepali brand for Nepalis to wear. With the fabric imported from Ludhiana, India, and the manufacturing factory located in Patan, I have been able to give the market what I had in mind. The printing machines are imported from California and are top class and that is how I had imagined my brand to be — uncompromising and pocket-friendly.”
On growth: “Initially, I had a target of selling at least one t-shirt per day. I thought that the concept of a Nepali brand might take some time to build but I am surprised with the exponential growth Phalano Luga has seen. In the past two years, my dream of selling one t-shirt per day has topped 30 t-shirts per day.”
On workers: “This is one of the bigger challenges I face. Retaining workers and getting the best ones is a big challenge. A group of Nepali workers are coming back to Nepal from Malaysia to work with me. Apart from retaining them, paying them the same amount they used to earn overseas is a challenge. The people I am working with right now are also working with the production unit of Nike, Adidas, Peter England and other such global brands, based in Nepal. The problem is not the quality of the workers, but the economy and the quality of local materials available.”
On funds: “While starting the business off, my bank was skeptical about giving me a loan. My capital investment was close to one crore and after convincing the bank, I had 30 per cent of the costs covered. Most of the funds were drawn from my own pockets.”
On new ventures: “As of now, with more than satisfactory sales, I have the confidence of expanding my business across the country and abroad. But my first priority would be maintaining the quality for a while before dreaming big. Phalano Coffeeghar which is the latest addition to my business venture is something I am looking up to for now. With Phalano Luga doing well, I partnered with an old friend, Prem Aryal and opened the cafe last week. I had the space and he had the ideas, we got together and came up with the Coffeeghar plan. Like the tees, the eatables available at the cafe will all be Nepali-centric. Long term plans for this cafe are branded water bottles and sugar sachets.”
On the future: “I aspire to make Phalano Luga as big as Nike and Adidas.”

Mad sad ad world. Graphic: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Kathmandu
With the country in dire need of post disaster economic recovery, it is expected that governing bodies address the concerns of major contributors to the GDP. The advertising industry is one such sector with the potential to help with economic recovery; and could provide a significant push towards an economic boom, just as the country needs it the most.
Advertising helps create successful businesses, which then lead to employment opportunities. Even media, the driving force behind growing economies, benefits from stability in the industry, as advertising is the chief source of revenue for mass media like newspapers, television, radio, print magazines and websites. Research has consistently shown that countries with larger investments in the advertising industry are more developed than other countries. For instance, the advertisement industry in the United States creates 18.2 million of the 126.7 million jobs. However, back home in Nepal, the predicament of the advertising industry is such that the government is yet to give due recognition to the industry.
According to the Advertising Association of Nepal (AAN), the total annual revenue of the advertising
industry is Rs 5.5 billion. While it is an industry with vast potential; it appears to lack order with various unresolved issues brimming under the surface.
The present scenario
Although at a very slow pace, the industry was witnessing growth before disaster struck. Post earthquake, the scenario looks far from encouraging. Is there a noticeable difference in the industry before and after the earthquake? Ranjit Acharya, CEO of Prisma Advertising says, “Before the earthquake, the industry was in its growing stage. Growth was rather slow but it was growing
nonetheless. Post earthquake, advertising agencies had to cut down on budgets, as it was the need of the hour. With no help from any quarter it was a necessity to cut down costs.” According to him, most businesses had to cut down on advertising budgets, which led to stagnancy in the industry. He says, “A person must seek medical help when ill and not cut down on medicinal costs. The same is with
advertisements.”
Deependra Tandon, Director of Business Advantage says, “In the first few months after the disaster in April/May we did not have any business. We have gradually recovered now and we hope that the business will revive in the festive season.” He adds that the business is still in its infancy and there is room for improvement.
Ahimsa Yonjan, Managing Partner at TBWA\Benchmark Nepal, says, “The earthquakes led to a rather disturbing slowdown for a month or two, but considering everything that has happened, the industry looks to have weathered the storm rather well”. He adds, “However, as an industry, we do not seem to have learned much from the experience, as there is actually very little difference in communication styles or brand behaviour before or after the earthquakes.”
The mushrooming of advertising agencies
AAN has 298 advertising agencies on its member roster, but there still exist several hundred more agencies that are not registered with the association. With so many advertising agencies operating in the market, it is still generally accepted that most of the advertisements that are produced in Nepal are not satisfactory. On this, Santosh Shrestha, President of AAN says, “Because there is no entry barrier to this industry, anyone can register and have an agency up and running in no time. While this opens a lot of doors for newcomers it leads to compromise on the quality. It becomes a tough job to monitor quality.” He further says, “The world of advertising is creative and fascinating. In Nepal, the industry has an estimated growth of 10 to 15 per cent annually. If we focus on quality control, nothing can stop this industry from growing in the coming years.”
Advertising agencies and advertisement standards
On the compromised quality of advertising and agencies not being up to the mark, Shrestha says, “The quality of advertisement depends of the level of awareness of the society, resources, budget and the economy. Advertisements reflect the attitude of the society. The market is small and the economy is not
progressive. The current focus is on production of effective advertisements rather than creative ones.”
He adds that they are responsible to cater to the mass with limited budget. He says, “Suppose there are three kids who study in grade three, six and eight. Now, all of them must be explained to in a similar manner, in a language they can comprehend. The teacher explains in the easiest way so that every one can understand. The same goes with advertisement.”
Joydeb Chackravarty, Managing Director, JWT – Thompson Nepal has a different view on this subject. He says, “Nepali consumers are exposed to creative advertisements, if not from within the country, but definitely from the world outside. They are intelligent and they know exactly what they want.
Advertisers should not underestimate their level of awareness and should not doubt their intelligence.”
He says that it is high time for the industry to push the envelope in terms of standards and creativity.
Yonjan says, “While I do agree that the overall quality of advertising could be a lot better, I think it is quite unfair to generalise and say that the quality of advertising agencies is not up to the mark. There are a few agencies doing good work locally, so we must give credit where it is due.” He further says, “As with any other industry however, a combination of many factors; such as, lack of industry knowledge and processes, timelines, an unwillingness to provide proper compensation on the side of all parties involved, leads to a large proportion of work being of poor quality. It is the same with art, music and movies. Much of what is produced is quite terrible, but there are those that stand out.”
The clean feed debate
For almost eight years now, AAN has lobbied with the government to introduce a Clean Feed Policy. This policy will ensure content filtering systems that can be used to block foreign commercials aired through foreign channels from reaching the Nepali audience. The main purpose of this policy will be to eliminate the trend of dubbing and encourage multinationals to produce and develop advertisements through local agencies.
Nirmal Raj Poudel, CEO of Welcome Advertising and Marketing, says, “Multinational companies dub foreign advertisements and broadcast them in local channels.  Further, the paid channels also include commercials. This results in quality compromise.”
However, some industrialists claim that clean feed is an uphill task in Nepal. They argue that competition will be killed with the introduction of this policy. A Clean Feed Committee has meanwhile been formed by AAN that has been doing research on the topic and is under dialogue with the government for a quick implementation of this policy.
The right way of doing things
According to some, one of the biggest challenges the industry currently faces is the lack of vision and leadership within the industry. Only self- regulation and quality checks can turn the industry around. Tandon says, “The change must start with the industry itself. Introducing policies is not enough for the development of the industry.” Yonjan has similar views, he says, “We cannot introduce laws to control or fix what are inherently industry problems. What is more necessary is an independent regulatory body that can develop and enforce a code of conduct/best practice model in place for the overall advertising market.”
Although the advertising industry is currently facing an uphill battle, this is still an industry that has enormous potential. With the industry only just beginning to mature, and mediums like digital and new age media opening up, there appears to be much to look forward to for the industry. For the rest of us, it remains the industry to watch.
In parting, it is perhaps Chakravarty who sums it up best — “The next five years are going to be challenging for the advertising industry in Nepal. However, if we follow the right way of doing things and remain honest and integrated there are chances that we can recover soon.”

The monsoon struck the village mid-June, but officials of Sangachowk VDC are still struggling to distribute cash relief to villagers.
Currently, the villagers are living inside temporary shelters made from rusted zinc sheets riddled with holes and timber salvaged from their damaged houses. They kept some zinc sheets and timber to shelter their cattle and poultry after distribution of relief amount was delayed.
Shyam Khadka, 55, of Pokhre said,”The rain water trickles through the zinc sheets. The families of my three sons are housed under one small temporary shelter. Even if the government distributes relief money it will not be sufficient to procure zinc sheets to construct temporary shelters that will accommodate the families of my three sons.”
Basanta Prasad Ghimire, secretary, Sangachowk VDC said cash relief had not been distributed as the registered households claiming cash relief outnumbered the actual damaged households.
“Over 28,000 households have registered for cash relief, whereas, the District Administration Office has allocated cash relief for only 22,000 households on the basis of existing documented records before the earthquake of April 25,” he said.
The government had announced immediate cash relief of Rs 15,000 for one damaged house. The joint families who have not legally divided properties are not eligible for immediate cash relief even if they had been staying in separate houses.
“The joint families who lost more than one house registered fore cash relief under names of different members of the same family,” Ghimire said, stressing that families who had lost more than one house are not satisfied with government policy.
He warned that a monitoring team comprising ward citizens’ forum would be deployed to find such joint families who had registered more than once for the same house before issuing the ID card to claim immediate cash relief and Rs 200,000 to further build a permanent house.
The government released Rs 5.53 billion to the local authorities for immediate relief countrywide in May.
According to District Disaster Relief Committee, the death toll was 3,656 in Sindhupalchowk. About 90 per cent of houses in the district were razed to the ground.

116,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/duplication-in-tax-headings-draws-flak/,"KATHMANDU: The draft of the new constitution has overlooked the concerns related to effective levying of major taxes and duplicated some tax headings in central and state governments, as well as provincial and local governments.
Such duplications might pose a threat to the revenue system once the country adopts a federal structure due to disputes of power allocation between central and provincial government to levy taxes, according to tax experts.
The draft constitution has proposed that excise and individual income tax can be levied by both the central and provincial governments. Similarly, it has also proposed that many other tax headings be levied by the provincial and local governments, like registration tax, vehicle tax and tourist fee.
“Even as related Acts will have to be formulated, the power allocation in the central, provincial and local governments will result in disputes when the laws related to taxes are enforced in the coming days,” opined Rup Khadka, tax expert and the chair of the government-formed High Level Tax System Review Commission. The draft constitution has extended authority to levy taxes, but it is silent on power allocation regarding enforcement, like what portion of the excise duty and IIT can be levied by the province and the portion of the registration and vehicle and land tax that can be levied by the local government.
Giving an example of South Sudan, Khadka said, “The taxes proposed to be levied by the central government were also placed in the domain of provincial government, which led to a dispute. It was later sorted out by forming a task force under the chairmanship of the finance minister of the centre, comprising finance ministers of provinces.”
According to him, it would be better to extend the authority to levy a certain tax to a particular government that can effectively levy that duty. “That power can be shared among other governments.”
The HLTSRC has suggested the finance committee of the Parliament to put customs, VAT, excise, corporate and individual income tax under the domain of the central government for effective enforcement, as these taxes are of stra-tegic importance and strong institutional mechanism is required to levy them effectively. Likewise, registration tax and vehicle tax have been recommended to be levied by provincial government.
Who is to levy what
Central government: Customs, excise, value added tax, corporate income tax, individual income tax, passport fee, visa fee, penalties and royalty of natural resources Provincial government: Wage tax (which covers large portion of individual income tax), land tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, excise, entertainment tax, advertisement tax, tourist fees, agriculture income tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources
Local government: Land and rent tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, service fees, tourist fees, business tax, entertainment tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources

117,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/development-bond-yields-fall-to-all-time-low/,"KATHMANDU: Yield on development bonds, regardless of their maturity period, has fallen to an all-time low, dampening sentiment of bankers, who have to tap the government securities market to meet some of the regulatory requirements.
Return on 15-year development bonds floated today by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) dropped to 2.65 per cent, the lowest since February 1964, when the government first introduced development bonds with a maturity period of five years to raise debt from the domestic market to finance development activities.
Surprisingly, returns on these securities are falling lately even as their maturity period is increasing.
When NRB auctioned five-year development bonds on May 28, the weighted average cut-off rate stood at four per cent. Then on June 4, when it floated seven-year development bonds, the return fell to 3.44 per cent.
The yield further dropped to 3.08 per cent when NRB offered nine-year development bonds on June 11.
The freefall continued on June 25 as well, when 10-year development bonds were floated. At that time, the weighted average interest rate had dropped to 2.99 per cent.
Considering 7.1 per cent inflation of mid-May, returns on these securities are negative in real term.
“Yields on bonds are falling rapidly because of excess liquidity in the banking sector,” Nara Bahadur Thapa, chief of Public Debt Management Department at NRB told The Himalayan Times.
Banks and financial institutions (BFIs) are currently sitting on excess liquidity of over Rs 70 billion. However, a large chunk of this money cannot be extended as loans because it is being used to meet the minimum regulatory net liquid asset to total deposit ratio, or LD ratio, of 20 per cent.
So, BFIs are rushing to grab these low-yielding securities assuming it is wiser to invest funds in bonds and get some returns rather than let them sit in coffers and generate no return.
Lately, what also appears to have exerted pressure on yields is the government’s decision to repay a part of debt.
So far this fiscal, the government has repaid Rs 42.55 billion of debt, including principal, shows the latest NRB report.
On the other hand, fresh government securities worth only Rs 42.34 billion have been floated in the market. This means net borrowing of the government stood at a negative of around Rs 211 million.
“Because of this, BFIs are rushing to replenish their stock of government securities to maintain LD ratio. This is raising the demand for bonds,” Thapa said, adding, “This is another reason for fall in bond returns.”
The falling bond return is, in fact, good news for the government, as it is now able to raise domestic debt at low interest rates. This means the cost of rebuilding parts of the country ravaged by the earthquake would be a little cheaper.
But bankers say this is creating ‘distortions’ in the market.
“Many BFIs that have purchased low-yielding instruments are now carrying a lot of market risk,” said Sashin Joshi, CEO of Nabil Bank.
This is because purchase of nine-, 10- and 15-year bonds is not a short-term investment, according to Joshi.
“And if returns on bonds rise next year, the instruments bought this year will turn into nothing but loss-making tools. At that time, many BFIs will have no option but to sell those instruments at a discount. This may hit their profitability as well,” Joshi added.

KATHMANDU: There is now little doubt that Pashupati Murarka, officiating president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), will take the helm of the largest private sector umbrella body tomorrow.
Murarka taking the lead of FNCCI has become a certainty after the two other contenders — Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar and Bhawani Rana — withdrew their candidacy for the post of FNCCI president from the election slated for tomorrow.
Organising a press meet on Tuesday, Rajkarnikar had announced his willingness to withdraw his candidacy and support Murarka if Rana also did the same. After Rana formally withdrew her candidacy yesterday, Rajkarnikar also formally pulled out his application today.
So, Murarka is the sole contender for the top post of FNCCI and will be announced as the unanimous president tomorrow. It also means that the post of senior vice president, which Murarka held before he took on the role of officiating chief of FNCCI, will be vacant.
Murarka had been appointed as the officiating president after its past president Pradeep Jung Pandey was arrested in a three-decade old corruption charge on March 18.
As per the FNCCI statute, election of the senior vice president should be done within five days of the president’s election. The senior vice president is elected from the executive committee, though the rest of the posts are filled through direct election.
According to FNCCI sources, there is general consensus among FNCCI members to select Bhawani Rana for the post of senior vice president. Leaders of the largest private sector umbrella body have claimed that rifts and groupism that occurred during the past elections will be bridged after the selection of a unanimous chief at FNCCI.

Nepal is hosting the Donors’ Conference for the reconstruction of the country in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes.
“Media reports that there was clash between us and there was lack of coordination while sending invitations to neighbouring countries are baseless. The finance minister and I were supposed to go to India and China respectively. But, I cancelled my visit to China after Chinese authorities informed us that Chinese foreign minister will not be able to participate in the conference due to prior engagement,” Pandey told the meeting of
National Disaster Management and Monitoring Special Committee of the Legislature Parliament headed by Speaker Subas Chandra Nembang today.
Finance Minister Mahat said that his ministry had prepared the 300-page Post Disaster Need Assessment, with the help of more than 200 experts divided into 23 sub-panels by working round the clock in view of the conference. “This is the official document of the government detailing the damage and need assessment. This document has created the base to see support from donor countries and inter-country agencies,” Mahat said.
The government has invited 65 countries and inter-governmental agencies, said Finance Mahat, adding: “Of them, 125 delegates of 40 countries and agencies have already expressed their commitment to participate in the conference”. Seven minister-level participants have sent their confirmation to participate in the conference, according to Mahat.
“Initially, donor countries wished to delay the conference to August-September. Citing the devastating earthquake situation, they proposed to hold the conference in New Delhi of India, Tokyo of Japan and Paris of France. They were reluctant to participate in the conference expressing their doubt over the safety of the participants as the situation had not been normal. However, we persistently stood on our stance of holding the conference in Kathmandu and made all arrangements for their safe living during their stay here. Ultimately, the donors were convinced and are expressing their commitment for their participation,” Mahat said.
Mahat said that the government would focus on foreign grant collection, sharing experiences of managing post-disaster situation and solidarity of friendly nations to Nepal’s crisis.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Pandey said that the government wanted to show the international community that the country was safe for tourism and it maintained complete harmony during the national crisis despite having around 125 different communities.
Mahat, responding to a complaint that Russian ambassador in Kathmandu did not get invitation till last Wednesday due to the government’s carelessness, said, “The government, six weeks ago, had emailed all the embassies and ambassadors in Kathmandu, making preliminary request to participate in the conference. The [Russian] ambassador had replied us via email that the country’s representative would not be able to participate in the conference due to pre-scheduled engagement on the conference day. Then, we did not send invitation to him. But, after we heard about the complaint, we have sent an invitation recently.”
Lawmakers including CPN-UML’s Madhav Kumar Nepal, Nepali Congress’s Ramchandra Paudel and Unified CPN-Maoist’s Girirajmani Pokharel, had urged the ministries to clarify the controversies related to the conference and suggested them to make the conference a success.
After listening to the two ministers, panel Chair Nembang instructed the government to take the neighboring countries and donors into confidence and also consultations with all the parties and take their feedback. Nembang also instructed the government to make an arrangement for making the foreign delegates observe the major tourist areas — both damaged and not damaged — independently during their visit to give a message that Nepal is safe for foreign tourists.

With the aim to incorporate recent policy and technical advancement, Family Welfare Division has updated clinical protocols on reproductive health.
Dissemination of information on reproductive health clinical protocol was done amidst an event held in the capital today.
The protocol designed for medical officers, staff nurses/ANMs and paramedics includes nine components — family planning, safe motherhood, newborn care, sexually transmitted infections/HIV/AIDS, adolescent sexual and reproductive health, prevention and management of infertility, safe abortion service, gynaecological morbidity and gender-based violence.

The protocol provides details on what health practitioners should do when a patient visits the health centre with reproductive health problems. Protocol presented in texts, flow charts and pictures will guide healthcare practitioners to provide quality reproductive healthcare services.
The protocol helps health practitioners for accurate diagnosis, examination and treatment of patients as it instructs the health practitioners in preparing summary of the case, explains about treatment for the health problems and also explains in detail about the need for referral and process of referral to the patients and his/her family.
“The objectives of the protocol are to improve the quality of reproductive health care for women, men, children and adolescents through evidence-based protocol, to standardise reproductive health care at different levels of healthcare and enhance the level of performance to ensure quality, to improve efficiency and better utilisation of service and to instil culture of accountability in the health system,” said Dr Punya Paudel, chief of the safe motherhood programme at Family Health Division.
“The new clinical protocol is developed as a guide for health workers to deliver quality reproductive service in Nepal and will be made accessible for all across the country,” said Dr Bhim Singh Tinkari, director of Family Health Division.

Those arrested are Madan Kumar Moktan, Sandesh Gole, Som Sunar, Ganesh Lama, Rikjen Moktan, Sadeep Gurung, Bharat Thapa Chhetri, Indra Bahadur Tamang, Bikram Bhujel, Raju Paudel, Sabin Tamang and Samit Tamang. They hail from Dhading, Makwanpur, Sindhupalchowk, Kavre and Nuwakot districts and are in age group of 20-30.
Three persons, including Madan Kumar were held with a stolen motorcycle (Ba 94 Pa 1142) from Kirtipur, and further investigation led to the arrest of nine others. Police have confiscated 40 stolen bikes from them. DSP Hobindra Bogati, MPR spokesperson, said it was the single biggest seizure of two-wheelers lifted by the racketeers. They had lifted the vehicles from Kirtipur, Balambu, Satungal, Kalimati, Pharping and Bafal areas of Kathmandu.
The gang would lift the bikes from the valley and rode the two-wheelers to other districts for sale. Racketeers are found selling a stolen bike for Rs 20,000 to Rs 100,000 depending on its condition and brand.
Most two-wheelers lifted from the city were sold to clients in rural parts that have road networks but lack presence of law enforcement officials. Victim Support Unit at Metropolitan Traffic Police Division registered a total of 1,093 complaints of bike theft in the past eight months (mid-April to mid-December). However, only 118 of them were recovered during the period.
Police have suggested the bike owners to park their bikes at safe places with handles locked and also to install intelligent locking system with double lock options, making it difficult for thieves to steal bikes.

Its key features include brief introduction and statistics of the local levels, GIS maps, contact number of people’s representatives and employees with photos, laws and rules, budget and programmes, emergency phone numbers and projects being conducted by local governments.
People may also lodge their grievances directly to the concerned local level through the app. It is an attempt to empower the people at local levels.
The app is linked to official website of local levels and any information or data uploaded and updated in the website can be received by smart phone users immediately. The app was initially developed for Dhulikhel Municipality. The app also provides information about time to avail services by the local governments, responsible officers, service charge and documents required, the MoFAGA said.
Users can receive, read and download data or information about various programmes and projects of the local levels on their smart devices. It also provides information about hospitals, educational institutions, tourist hubs, religious and cultural sites, and hotels through interactive maps.

Kathmandu Metropolitan City has started removing illegal hoardings, billboards, flex boards, posters and other promotion materials from public places and façades and rooftops of buildings. It has also started removing messy overhead cables.
Chief of Kathmandu Municipal Police Dhanapati Sapkota said areas such as Babarmahal, Tinkune and Kalimati were rid of visual pollutants. “We will also be removing wall paintings and posters pasted on utility poles to make the city visually more appealing,” he said. According to KMC, this move will continue for indefinite period.
Visual pollutants have not only degraded the landscape and skyline of the city but also jeopardised the safety of pedestrians and other road users. The government has formed four task forces led by KMC to make this campaign a success. These task forces include representatives and technicians from the Department of Roads, Department of Urban Development and Building Construction, Nepal Telecommunications Authority, Nepal Electricity Authority, Kathmandu District Administration Office and Metropolitan Police Range.
A meeting of stakeholder agencies headed by Minister of Home Affairs Ram Bahadur Thapa convened in Singha Durbar yesterday had taken the decision to clear the city of visual pollutants.
The government has also issued a 15-day notice to telephone and internet service providers to remove wires strung on utility poles, and lay the cables underground. If they failed to remove the wires within the stipulated time, KMC will dispose of them.
The government took the initiative in line with the Supreme Court order to remove hoardings, advertising posters, flexes and pamphlets that have caused visual pollution in the city. Recently, a contempt of court case was filed at the apex court for the government’s failure to abide by the SC order passed on 2 September 2015.
Most commercial buildings and public places of the city are now filled with hoarding and flex boards. They can be seen on rooftops, verandas, sides of buildings, utility poles and almost everywhere. Hoardings can also be seen on walls, which can collapse due to the weight of heavy advertisement materials, during disasters like earthquakes, causing injuries and fatalities. Similarly, tangled web of overhead cables also add to visual pollution.

Kathmandu, December 27
The National Human Rights Commission has made an eight-point recommendation to the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the Federal Parliament and all seven provincial assemblies to create an environment for enactment of human rights-friendly laws as articulated by the constitution.
According to a press release issued by the rights body today, the recommendations are based on conclusions of discussions held with around 850 persons, including ministers of the federal government; chief ministers and ministers of federal government, speaker and deputy speaker, members of provincial assemblies, human rights activists, civil society and representatives from professional organisations, in Kathmandu to mark the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
During the discussions, stakeholders had expressed their commitment to the implementation of the fundamental rights and enactment of rights-friendly laws.
NHRC recommended the House panel and PAs to create an environment for incorporation of fundamental and human rights into laws and for passage of some of the bills stuck in the Parliament.
The House committee and PAs have also been told to issue necessary directives to the concerned bodies to initiate legal action against the perpetrators of human rights violations and deliver justice for the victims; accord a high priority to formulate rights relating to implementation of economic, social and cultural rights; provide necessary suggestions to the government for making various policies and programmes rights-friendly; exert pressure to the government to strictly adhere to the principles of proportional inclusion in all state bodies and ensure participation of the NHRC and other stakeholder agencies while formulating laws related to fundamental and human rights, in compliance with the international norms.
Earlier, the rights body had urged the federal government to initiate amendment of laws related to health, education and security that contradict the constitution; hire necessary employees or experts to fulfil the commitment of the provincial, local governments to implement fundamental human rights and translate the commitments by all three tiers of the government to ending the culture of impunity into action, among others.

The establishment faction of the Nepali Congress today decided to extend the tenure of the current leadership by one year. The tenure of Sher Bahadur Deuba’s leadership was to end on March 3.
The rival faction led by senior NC leader Ramchandra Paudel, which had boycotted today’s central working committee meeting, refused to accept the party’s decision. Paudel told THT that Deuba had put the party into crisis by unfairly extending his tenure. “We’ll not accept this decision. We are going to organise a press conference tomorrow to tell the public what we think about today’s decision.”
He said he was surprised by the party’s decision as party leadership had assured him that everything would be on the basis of consensus.
NC issued a press release stating that the decision to extend the tenure of the current leadership was taken as preparation for the next national convention would take time.   The party also termed the situation extra-ordinary to justify the extension of the tenure of current leadership. The party added that preparation for the next national convention should be done as per the new structure of the party.
The party also decided to endorse the Tarun Dal’s decision to extend the tenure of the office bearers for six months. The Tarun Dal had recently taken a decision to extend its tenure for six months. Deuba will issue directives to Tarun Dal to hold its convention within six months.
The CWC also decided to increase the number of party’s departments to 47 which was opposed by the Paudel faction. The NC stated that office bearers of the party’s departments would be appointed soon.

Kathmandu, December 26
Tourism enterprises in Thamel area which have been deprived of landline telephone and internet services continue to be affected, as campaigners involved in clearing the area of dangling wires said the drive will take a few more days.
Thamel Tourism Development Council had launched the drive to remove all types of wires dangling from utility poles from December 15. The Council had said it would remove all the dangling wires within a week, allowing telephone and internet services to resume afterwards. But, 11 days after the campaign began, TTDC officials said a few more days were needed to completely clear the tourist hub of the dangling wires. Punya Ram Lageju Treasurer of TTDC said they faced hardships while clearing the messy wires, which prolonged the work. The work was also halted for three days for Christmas celebration in the area.
“We encountered some problems while initiating the drive. Now since everything has been settled it will take only a few more days to rid Thamel of messy wires,” Lageju said.
Internet Service Providers’ Association of Nepal, which had been strongly lobbying against the campaign said they had no options but to provide internet services through wires distributed from utility poles.
Majority of the wires removed from utility poles belonged to internet service providers and Nepal Telecommunication Authority.
A recently held joint meeting of all stakeholders including TTDC and ISPAN had reached a three point agreement to curb existing problem of dangling wires.
The agreement said wires of all kinds inside one square kilometre of core Thamel area should be provided through underground ducting within three months.
Until underground ducting is carried out all the internet service providers should clip wires on the walls of houses, which needed to be removed once underground ducting is completed.
Bhoj Raj Bhat, chair of ISPAN, however, strongly opposed the idea of clipping wires on the walls of private houses as convincing the house owners would be a tough deal. He also said underground ducting in country like Nepal was not easy as every day the public and the government bodies are found digging the road for multiple purposes like drinking water supply and sewerage management.
“If TTDC had sought our help before abruptly cutting the wires, we would have provided a better solution,” Bhat said.
He also said fixing new wires to resume services might take from one to two months. TTDC said they had informed all stakeholders and published a public notice on a national daily days before the campaign began.

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Ishwor Pokharel informed Upper House of the Parliament that lease agreement with Gokarna Forest Resort was signed based on the legal process initiated by previous governments.
Making statement in today’s meeting of the National Assembly regarding the issue, DPM Pokharel argued that the agreement was renewed as per market price and for additional benefit for the state.
The government decided to renew the agreement for 50 years as per the demand of Yeti Holdings, the resort operating company. The government had signed agreement with the company on 18 April 2009, for the first time.
The lease agreement was renewed as per the decision of the trust on 9 February 2014. Clarifying that he became the chairperson of the trust as per the legal provision in the act, which said that a minister designated by the prime minister could be the chairperson of the trust, DPM Pokharel said, “It is good to keep an eye on government activities to ensure that things do not go wrong. But only the facts of an issue should be pointed out. Comments on the prime minister and me related to the issue are false.
We have been working to issue white paper regarding the agreement after sometimes.”
He said a proposal was presented at the Cabinet on the basis of a report prepared by taskforce formed by the trust to review the agreement.
DPM Pokharel said they had also obtained information on fair market value and environmental aspect by consulting with Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal, Nepal Tourism Board and Gokarneshwor Municipality before renewing the agreement.

Over 75,000 persons have pledged to donate their cornea to Nepal Eye Bank at Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology posthumously, while around 15,000 persons have regained their sight after corneal transplant so far.
The eye bank was established on 16 September 1994 to provide corneal transplant service in the country. As the only eye bank in Nepal, TIO has been harvesting, processing and preserving corneas for the past 25 years, read a press statement released by TIO. In the initial years, technicians would take corneal tissue out from bodies brought for cremation at Pashupati Aryaghat after obtaining permission from concerned relatives.
These days, consultants deputed from the eye bank provide counselling and information for visiting eye patients and their relatives at Bir, TU Teaching, Gangalal and Patan hospitals for cornea donation.
This has increased the number of people pledging to donate eyes after death. Regional cornea collection centres have been established in Biratnagar, Lahan, Hetauda, Bharatpur, Pokhara, Lumbini and Kailali.
According to TIO, Nepal is self-sufficient in corneal transplant.
There was a time when corneas used to be brought to Nepal from foreign countries for transplant, but now they are collected from within the country. Corneal tissue is usable for up to four days when kept under appropriate conditions, according to Dr Reeta Gurung at TIO.
Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology is set to organise a mass condolence meeting on Tilganga premises on Saturday to pay tribute to people, who donated their eyes posthumously.
“The special memorial service aims to encourage more people to pledge cornea donation, and share experience of persons who benefited from corneal transplant,” said Dr Gurung. The eye bank has been supported by the International Federation of Eye and Tissue Banks and complies with the standard set by the international organisation. Nirmal Lama (a late political leader) and Kedar Man Bethit (a late literary figure) were pioneer eye donors, who inspired others to follow suit.
Corneas might be damaged due to birth defects, injury and haphazard use of orthodoxical treatment, resulting in the loss of vision, read the statement.

Kathmandu Metropolitan City will form four task force and start removing the visual pollutants with effect from tomorrow, read press release issued by the MoHA. The meeting has decided to give ultimatum to telephone, cable and internet service providers to remove the wires strung on utility poles.
“If they failed to remove the wires within the stipulated time, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City will remove them,” the release read.
Minister Thapa said the move was in line with the Supreme Court order to remove hoarding boards, advertising posters and pamphlets that have caused visual pollution in the city.
Recently, a contempt of court was filed at the apex court against the government’s failure to abide by the SC order passed on 2 September 2015.
Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Bidhya Sundar Skaya said the metropolis will act on it from tomorrow.
Most of the commercial and public places of Kathmandu are now crowded with hoarding boards.
They can be seen on rooftops, verandas, sides of buildings, utility poles and open grounds. They are apparently popping up using a loophole in the law, deteriorating the landscape of the city and jeopardising safety of pedestrians and road users.
Hoarding boards can also be seen on walls along the roads, which can collapse due to the weight of heavy advertisement materials during disasters like earthquakes, causing injuries and fatalities.
But the authority concerned is doing precious little. Most of the hoarding boards have been placed without conducting safety audit. Advertisement (Regulation) Act, prohibits the display of hoarding boards on electricity and telephone poles.
Dangled web of overhead cables all over the city has added to visual pollution.
The cables hanging low in parts of the city have also put pedestrians and motorists at risk.

139,https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/recurrent-pneumonia-prevalent-among-nepali-children/,"Kathmandu, December 25
On an average one in nine children with pneumonia has recurrent pneumonia.
In a study conducted by Dr Prashant Rijal and his team at Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital on 653 patients of the hospital from July 2013 to June 2018, 74 were diagnosed with recurrent pneumonia. Children between two months and 15 years of age who had a history of two or more episodes of pneumonia were studied. “Air pollution, overcrowding, malnutrition, congenital anomalies, congenital immune deficiency, gastroesophageal reflux (return of stomach’s contents back up into esophagus), lack of availability of vaccines are some of the reasons for the recurrence of pneumonia in children,” according to Dr Rijal.
Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection caused either by virus, bacteria or fungi which affects lungs. “Multiplication of such organisms leads to swelling of the lungs. When an individual has pneumonia, air sacs in the lungs are filled with pus and fluid. It makes breathing difficult and painful,” he said. Premature babies, babies with low birth weight, babies who are not exclusively breastfed and are not immunised are prone to pneumonia.
Besides, babies living in polluted environment, in rooms with no proper ventilation, babies who are malnourished and those whose parents indulge in smoking are also equally prone to the disease.
Doctors have warned that cases of pneumonia will rise in the winter season.
“Respiratory infection is higher in the winter season as there is more moisture in the air,” said Bishnu Prasad Upadhyay, Consultant Microbiologist at National Academy of Medical Sciences.
According to World Life Expectancy survey, influenza and pneumonia deaths in Nepal reached 10,535 or 6.45 per cent of total deaths in 2017. Influenza and pneumonia claimed lives of 47 persons out of every 100,000 people in 2017.
The World Life Expectancy index was created using most recent data from sources like WHO, World Bank, UNESCO and individual country database. The survey is based on 50 prominent ailments and accidents that claim lives of people in 183 countries.
Though children suffer from pneumonia all round the year there is rise in the number of pneumonia cases during the winter. “It is because the virus/bacteria gets favourable environment for its growth usually in the winter and rainy seasons,” said Dr Rijal.
According to WHO, pneumonia accounted for 15 per cent of all deaths of children under five years old, killing 808,694 children in 2017, across the world. “Early diagnosis and care is necessary for children suffering from pneumonia,” said Dr RP Bichha, director of Kanti Children’s Hospital.
If children suffer from fever, cough and common cold, have difficulty in breathing, have a sore throat, immediate medical help should be sought, the doctors said.
“To prevent children from pneumonia breastfeeding, proper vaccination, keeping them away from cold, pollution and timely treatment is necessary,” said Dr Rijal.
The infection spreads via air-borne droplets from cough sneeze. Therefore, children are prone to contact the infection at schools, added Dr Bichha. Early recognition and management of the causes of pneumonia is expected to reduce the number of pneumonia related hospital admissions and mortality, according to Dr Rijal.

Of the rescued persons, 129 men, 14 women, one girl and a boy have been sent back to their houses after providing them psycho-social counselling, while remaining 70 have not provided accurate information about their families. As a result, KMC has been finding it hard to reunite them with their families.
According to Ramji Adhikari chairperson of Manav Sewa Ashram, a shelter house for homeless people, remaining rescued persons have refused to provide right address of their houses fearing that they would be sent back to their homes.
Adhikari said, “They are reluctant to reveal their identity due to their personal reasons. This has caused difficulty for the shelter and Kathmandu Metropolitan City to reunite them with their families.”
On the occasion of its 25th anniversary, Kathmandu Metropolitan City had launched rescue drive of street people from December 15-18.
It had rescued helpless persons mostly from around Kalimati, New Road, Indrachowk and Bouddha. Most of the rescued persons were male and they hailed from Sindhupalchowk, Kavrepalanchowk, Nuwakot, Dhading and Chitwan, according to the Ashram.

Superintendent of Police Jeevan Kumar Shrestha and MTPD spokesperson said as many as 15,444 drivers and riders were brought to book for breaching traffic rules in the past eight days. Public vehicles plying the valley roads with their doors open topped the chart of offenders. MTPD and its all 35 units in the valley have been deploying traffic police personnel to take action against rule violators.
During the period of eight days, traffic police personnel also recorded common types of rule violations such as rampant parking, breaking traffic signals, use of mobile phone while driving, seat belt infraction, mechanical modification of original shape of bikes, overloading, overtaking from the left side of the road, violation of one-way traffic rule, zig-zagging, drunk driving and reckless driving.
Traffic police personnel armed with communication sets, GoPro cameras, surveillance vehicles and breathalysers have fanned out across the valley with major focus at busy intersections to strictly enforce the traffic rules, said SP Shrestha.
More than 400 CCTV have been closely monitoring vehicular movement. Persons driving under the influence and lane discipline violators are required to pay fine and participate in an hour-long lecture on traffic safety to get their licence back. In spite of the punishment, most motorists continue to violate traffic rules. Wilful violation of rules is one of the reasons why the capital city has suffered traffic congestion and is vulnerable to road accidents, according to MTPD.
According to SP Shrestha most of the offenders are well-experienced and well-educated drivers.
Lack of infrastructure, inadequate road network and traffic congestion during peak hours have also made traffic rule violations a norm in the valley.

According to section 23 of the bill, the prison administration shall allow the couple to meet each other for the purpose of protecting their right to reproduction. The bill, which will substitute the existing Prison Act-1963, has also proposed a provision for granting permission to male and female jailbirds for marriage.
“If male and female inmates, who are serving sentence in the same prison and have attained the legal age, wish to tie the knot, they shall have to submit an application to the prison administration for marriage registration.
Even any male or female, who is not doing time in jail, can marry an inmate by fulfilling the same procedure,” states section 28 of the bill.
If the prison administration receives an application, it shall write to the concerned agency for marriage registration.
It will require the prison administration to take the inmates along with security personnel to the district administration office for marriage registration on the day as prescribed by the DAO.
The bill proposes special provisions for accommodation, food and health facilities for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers doing time in jail. As per section 37, if a female inmate, who is in the second trimester of her pregnancy, wishes to go home or somewhere else inside the country for pregnancy care and other health services, the prison administration shall grant permission against bank guarantee, on the condition that she will return to the prison after completion of 60 days of childbirth. Article 38 (2) of the constitution states that every woman shall have the right to safe motherhood and reproductive health.
However, no pregnant woman sentenced to jail for life and convicted of heinous crime shall be entitled to such facility. “If the pregnant woman, who is temporarily released on parole, fails to report to the prison within the stipulated time, security personnel shall be deployed to produce her before the jail, besides confiscation of her bank guarantee,” reads the bill.
The bill requires the prison administration to pay special attention to the care of inmates with physical and mental disabilities and those suffering from terminal diseases and having attained the age of 65.

Nepal Police have arrested seven persons on the charge of abducting a ‘top Nepali model’ and trying to sell her off to a religious cult in India.
Those arrested have been identified as Krishna Lama, Umesh Shah, Dil Kumar Budha Magar, Dilip Pandhera, Umesh Majhi, Ranjit Kumar Chaudhary and Prema Tamang, who hail from different places of Kathmandu, Janakpur and Biratnagar. All seven of them were remanded to police custody for seven days by the Kathmandu District Court today.
Police arrested them on December 22, 23 and 24  following a week-long investigation.
Deputy Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati at Metropolitan Police Range, Teku, said relatives of the model (whose identity has been kept secret) had filed an FIR in police station about a week ago about the trafficking of the girl.
Police said the girl was approached by some people from her modelling agency. DSP Bogati said the traffickers were looking for a girl with fair complexion, who was exactly six feet tall and without any scar on her body. After coming into contact with the model, who matched all the features, the traffickers had asked her to join a programme to be held in Biratnagar and offered her handsome pay.
In Biratnagar, she was taken to a religious camp, where she was held captive. “There the girl was forced to wear religious dress and tie black threads on her legs. Some people chanted mantras in front of her and worshipped her,” DSP Bogati said.
According to DSP Bogati the girl was being prepared to be sent to a religious cult in India, but police intervened in time and were able to rescue her. He said after interrogating the arrested persons it was found that the girl might have been sought by religious cult leaders for human sacrifice.
Each of the traffickers were paid an amount ranging from Rs one lakh to Rs five lakh to take the girl to India.
Police are still investigating the case.

On Monday, co-chairman of the Samajwadi Party and Deputy Prime Minister Upendra Yadav had tendered resignation to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli citing the government’s reluctance to honour a previously forged consensus on constitution amendment as the reason. Yadav’s proposal on forming a panel to study the need for amendment was not entertained by PM Oli.
A day later, the party made an announcement that it is withdrawing its support previously extended to the Oli government which was based on certain conditions. Party co-chairs Baburam Bhattarai and Upendra Yadav briefed the media about the executive committee’s decision to leave the coalition.
The government, in the wake of recent development, will no longer enjoy the support of two-thirds majority in the lower house of the Parliament. Samajwadi Party’s oust and subsequently its withdrawal of support will, however, have little or no impact on the Oli government’s stability.
The ruling party Nepal Communist Party (NCP) has more than required share of parliamentarians needed to form government.
It would now be interesting to observe what the Rashtriya Janata Party-Nepal (RJP-N)’s move would be next. Recently, Nepal received another political surprise as the NCP (NCP) and RJP-N signed an agreement to hold each other’s backs for the upcoming National Assembly elections.

The government has recommended senior advocate and former attorney general Laxmi Bahadur Nirala as member of the Judicial Council.

The Cabinet meeting last Friday took the decision. Nirala’s appointment to the post is subject to endorsement from the Parliamentary Hearing Committee. The PHC today invited complaint against him. It has given 10 days time to file complaints, if any, against Nirala, said PHC Chairperson Laxman Lal Karna. “As per the Cabinet’s decision of December 20, the PHC has invited complaints against Nirala,” Karna told the THT.
Nirala’s recommendation to the post comes after Padam Prasad Baidik resigned as JC member on December 5, hoping to secure nomination for the post of Supreme Court justice.

Police have arrested four Bangladeshi nationals with counterfeit Nepali currency notes with face value of Rs 18,000 from Lokanthali in Bhaktapur today.
Those taken into custody have been identified as Suman Khan, 26, Ali Ahamed, 41, Robel Mikda, 21, and Mohammed Ullah, 21. All the fake banknotes are in denomination of Rs 1,000. Police initiated action after the owner of a gift shop in Thimi Municipality-1, suspected that two banknotes tendered by Khan were not genuine and alerted local police on Thursday.
Acting on the information, police launched a search operation and arrested the four Bangladeshi nationals with counterfeit notes worth Rs 18,000.
Bhaktapur District Court remanded them to five-day police custody for further investigation into the case. The racketeers were involved in circulating fake banknotes and using them to purchase goods at night. They tucked the fake banknotes between genuine ones in order to circulate them.
“You need to make meticulous observation to say that a note is not genuine and thus many people might have been defrauded by the gang. A genuine note is felt rough when you run your fingers through it, but fake notes lack this feature. Generally, fake Nepali currency lack raised watermark, words and metallic thread, permanent features of a genuine banknote,” police said, appealing to all to be cautious.
In 2018, Nepal Rastra Bank had warned that circulation of high denomination counterfeit notes could adversely affect the country’s economic security. Earlier, police had arrested six persons with counterfeit Nepali currency notes with face value of Rs 26.06 million from different places of Kathmandu and Lalitpur.

The Ministry of Home Affairs today issued a three-point circular to all district administration offices of Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces directing them to initiate stringent action against anyone who encourages or practises Chhaupadi.
Under-secretary Umakanta Adhikari at Peace, Security and Crime Control Section of the MoHA told THT that DAOs were told to form a mechanism comprising chief district officer, district government attorney and district police chief with immediate effect to act tough against the worst form of gender-based violence.
“The government will now bring to book any person who practises or encourage others to practise Chhaupadi, which is a punishable crime. The MoHA has directed DAOs to eliminate the superstition and taboos associated with menstruation, which is a normal biological process,” he said.

In a bid to fur ther strengthen the drive to discourage this practice, the MoHA has also tasked the mechanism led by CDO to deprive the people, who practise and encourage Chhaupadi, of social security allowances and facility of subsidised loan. “Members of a household and other persons who banish women or girls from their homes during menstruation will be deemed ineligible to enjoy senior citizen allowance, other social security schemes and subsidised loan,” Under-secretary Adhikari said.
The district-level mechanism has also been tasked to identify and destroy all chhau sheds. Though the Supreme Court ruled Chhaupadi illegal in 2005, it is still prevalent in parts of Karnali and Sudurpashim provinces. During the mensuration cycle, women are forced to stay in specifically designated huts which lack basic facilities like beds, heating and sanitation, among others.
As many as 15 girls and women died in chhau sheds in the past 13 years in Achham and Dailekh districts, according to a report released by the National Human Rights Commission on March 14.
Chhaupadi is linked to Hinduism. As per Chhaupadi practice, women are considered impure when they menstruate and during post-natal state. The penal code also criminalises Chhaupadi.
The new law stipulates a three-month jail sentence or Rs 3,000 fine, or both, for anyone who forces a woman to follow the ill-practice.

Kathmandu, December 24
The government has decided to bring three new acts in the education sector. It is working to formulate Education Act, Technical and Professional Act and Higher Education Umbrella Act.
Speaking at a programme organised by Education Journalists Group in the capital today, Minister of Education, Science and Technology Giriraj Mani Pokharel said, “After discussions with stakeholders and experts we realised that separate acts are required to ensure quality education.”
The ministry has done homework on issues to be included in those acts, according to Minister Pokharel. He said local government should lead school education, aided by provincial and federal governments.
Participants at the programme suggested for sound co-ordination between the three-tiers of government to improve quality of education in the country.
Finding of a research titled ‘Education in federalism: Best Practices, Opportunities and Challenges’ by Education Journalists Group was presented at the event. “Regular inspection and monitoring with active participation of parents and electronic attendance have helped in decreasing absenteeism of teachers at schools,” said Rajan Sharma, founding president of the group.
The research was conducted at 27 schools of 13 local levels across the country. It studied teachers’ management, training; attempts being made to enhance quality of education, role of communities in school education and improvement of school infrastructure.
Problems faced by schools have been solved by local governments. Federal structure has ended the need of making long journey to districts education offices by the members of school management committees. It has also eased the process of hearing complaints and decision making, according to the study.
“The local levels were found working actively to improve school education,” said Sharma. The research also revealed that local levels have been providing materials for early childhood care and development to help school children learn effectively. Pointing out the challenges of local levels in education sector, the researchers said there have been problems in appointment of teachers at schools. There is conflict between the federal government and local government regarding the appointment of teachers. The researchers suggested that federal education act be made and implemented at the earliest.

Ending months of speculation, Samajwadi Party-Nepal today exited the government. Ministers representing the party — Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Upendra Yadav and Minister of Urban Development Mohammad Ishtiaq Rai — tendered their resignation to the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers this afternoon.
In his resignation addressed to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, SP-N Chairperson Yadav said the government unilaterally broke the two-point pact signed between the then Federal Socialist Forum-Nepal and the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) on 28 May 2018 on the basis of which the FSF-N joined the government. The FSF-N merged with Naya Shakti Party-Nepal to form the SP-N.
In the agreement signed between Yadav and NCP Co-chairmen KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the two sides had agreed to address issues raised by the FSF-N during its agitation by amending the constitution on the basis of mutual understanding and in the interest of people and nation.
Yadav stated in his resignation that he time and again raised the issue of constitution amendment in the Cabinet and in the Parliament, and even submitted a written reminder to the prime minister.
“In this context, in my capacity of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, I presented a proposal in the Cabinet yesterday to form an expert recommendation committee to do groundwork for constitution amendment. However, the government rejected the proposal, making it clear that it had broken the two-point pact unilaterally,” stated Yadav. “Since there’s no moral reason to remain in the government, I resign from the post of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs with immediate effect,” he added.
The SP-N’s decision to quit the government comes on the heels of the NCP forging an electoral alliance with Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal for the upcoming election of the National Assembly in Province 2. Earlier, the RJP-N, FSF-N and Nepali Congress had cooperated for NA election in the province.
In the last Cabinet reshuffle, Oli allotted Yadav, the then minister of health and population, the portfolio of law, justice and parliamentary affairs when Yadav was on a foreign trip. Although Yadav had said the reshuffle was done in consultation with him, some party leaders, including SP-N Federal Council Chairperson Baburam Bhattarai, strongly criticised the government for insulting the party by reshuffling the Cabinet without consulting it.
Speculations about SP-N quitting the government had started right after the merger of Yadav-led FSF-N and Bhattarai-led NSP-N. Bhattarai had been pressuring Yadav to quit the government and start a new movement for constitution amendment. The speculation got further currency after Cabinet reshuffle and NA election alliance between the NCP and RJP-N.
The fresh development has also given rise to another speculation that the RJP-N will join the government.
However, RJP-N leaders say they will not join the government unless their concerns are addressed. RJP-N leader Laxman Lal Karna said if they had to join the government, they would have done so much earlier as the party had initially extended its support to the government.
“How can we join the government at a time when our party members are still facing police cases and our leaders are in jail,” said Karna. “Above all, there has not been any progress regarding our major demand of constitution amendment.”
As far as the NA election alliance is concerned, Karna said they did so because it was the only option for them to maintain their representation in the Upper House. He added that it was purely an election alliance.
Meanwhile, the exit of the SP-N means the government no longer enjoys two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Of the total 275 HoR members, NCP has 174, 10 short of two-thirds majority. SP-N has 17 HoR members.

A total of 122 Chinese nationals, who were arrested from three different locations in Kathmandu yesterday, have been remanded to police custody for five days to conduct thorough investigation into their activities.
Police, who have confiscated 500 laptops and desktop computers, over 800 mobile phones and more than 1,000 SIM cards from houses rented by Chinese nationals, believe that those arrested were involved in criminal activities, including cyber and financial crime. “But it is too early to come to any conclusion now as investigations are under way. We have, therefore, put them behind bars on charges of committing social offence,” said Senior Superintendent of Police Uttam Raj Subedi, who heads Metropolitan Police Range, Teku.

Police have not been able to extract much information from the arrested Chinese largely because of language barrier. “We have requested teachers from Biswo Bhasa Campus and officials of the Chinese Embassy to work as translators,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati.
This is the first time Nepal Police has arrested such a large number of foreigners in a day. Of the arrested, eight are females. A majority of those arrested are below 45.
Most of them had visited Nepal on tourist visas, while others were in possession of student visas. It is not known whether the Chinese were living here with valid visas or were overstaying.
“We have not been able to get hold of passports of most of the Chinese. So we cannot comment about their visa status,” DSP Bogati said.
Deputy Inspector General Neeraj Bahadur Shahi, who heads the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police, said, “Chinese security agencies had informed IGP Sarbendra Khanal about operation of an illegal Chinese ring in Kathmandu during the 88th INTERPOL General Assembly in Chile in October.”
This information prompted police to monitor movements of Chinese nationals in Kathmandu. Yesterday police barged into seven houses — three in Manamaiju and two each in Bansbari and Budhanilkantha — and arrested 122 Chinese nationals.

The apex court said this in the full text of its verdict delivered in a case filed by advocates Padam Bahadur Shrestha and Shatkon Shrestha against the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, among others.
The SC had decided the case on February 11. The SC also issued a directive order to the government asking it to enact Animal Welfare Act to prohibit inhumane transportation of animals and birds.
A division bench of justices Meera Khadka and Tej Bahadur KC delivered the verdict.
The petitioners had stated in their writ petition that the government should prohibit people from transporting animals from one place to another in an inhumane and cruel manner as it was against the law.
They said the legal provision that barred people from transporting animals for more than eight hours without feeding them was being blatantly violated by traders in the absence of effective monitoring.

HONG KONG: Hundreds of protesters marched through Hong Kong shopping malls on Thursday, disrupting business in the Asian financial hub for a third day over the festive period and prompting riot police to close off a mall in a tourist district.
The “shopping protests” have targeted malls across the Chinese-ruled city since Christmas Eve, turning violent at times with police firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators in areas filled with shoppers and visitors.
While the turnout on Thursday was smaller than on the previous two days, riot police stepped up patrols at shopping centers on the Kowloon peninsula and in the rural New Territories.
Dozens of police with batons and shields surrounded and sealed off the Langham Place shopping mall in Kowloon’s Tsim Sha Tsui district after black-clad, masked protesters occupied it.
“I think the purpose for us to come out is to… let people realize that so many front-line protesters sacrificed (things) for them. They should not forget and (simply) celebrate Christmas,” said Sandy, a young demonstrator who wore a black mask to hide her identity.
“…We have been fighting for almost seven months now, and the Hong Kong police have done so many bad things.”
The protests began more than six months ago in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
They have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement, and became more confrontational over the festive season. Earlier in December, after pro-democracy candidates overwhelmingly won district council elections, they had been largely peaceful.
Many protesters have been angered by what they see as the use of unnecessary force by the police, and demanded an independent inquiry into the force’s behaviour.
Police, who say they have used only minimum force to control the protests, on Thursday detained several people at a mall in rural Tai Po, north of the city’s financial center, public broadcaster RTHK said.
Demonstrators are also angry at what they perceive as increased meddling by Beijing in freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering, saying it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula put in place at that time, and blames foreign forces for fomenting unrest.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam condemned the protesters in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying many Hong Kongers and tourists were disappointed their Christmas Eve celebrations had been ruined, while local businesses had also been hit.
On Thursday, some restaurants and stores pulled down their shutters in the malls as protesters, some wearing balaclavas and carrying black flags, marched by.
The government on Thursday criticized “unprecedented violence” by some protesters, but said that protecting freedoms and human rights remained a top priority.

158,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/veteran-climbers-skeptical-that-proposed-rules-for-mount-everest-will-stop-deaths/,"
KATHMANDU: Veteran climbers of Mount Everest are skeptical that proposed new regulations by the Nepalese government to tighten the permit process for adventurers will address the root causes of this year’s heavy death toll on the world’s tallest peak.
American mountaineers Ed Viesturs and Alan Arnette said planned new laws – if they are introduced at all – are unlikely to tackle the growing trend of inexperienced climbers rushing in packs to scale the 29,035-foot (8,850-metre) Himalayan peak.
“I’ve seen this movie so many times it’s totally predictable,” Arnette told Reuters in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “Every year since 2013, something goes wrong and they (the Nepal government) announce all these new rules and never implement them.”
Eleven climbers died on Mount Everest this year – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side. Many perished when a rush to climb the mountain during a short window of suitable weather in late May led to a “traffic jam” near the summit.
“Most teams opt to go for the summit when the first weather window is predicted,” Viesturs told Reuters in one of a series of interviews by phone and email.
“Everyone is afraid of missing what might be the one and only perfect day. There are typically several good summit days, but there’s pressure to go when everyone else goes.”
Nepal has traditionally issued climbing permits to anyone prepared to pay the $11,000 fee, handing out a record 381 passes this year. With essential Sherpas and guides added, more than 800 people were trying to reach the summit during the short weather window.
TRAFFIC JAM IN THE DEATH ZONE
The overcrowding – which caught worldwide attention when a photograph of a queue of climbers stepping over bodies to reach the summit went viral – caused fatal delays in the thin air in what is known as the “death zone” above 8,000 metres. That raised concerns that inexperienced mountaineers were being encouraged to attempt the climb by unscrupulous guide companies.
Among the changes proposed by the Nepalese government is a requirement for climbers to submit a medical report by a certified doctor disclosing their history and state of health. Another suggested requirement was the climbers submit proof they had scaled another 6,500-metre peak in Nepal.
Arnette said the first change was unlikely to be enough, given the potential to forge medical documents, while the second made little sense as many climbers have scaled higher peaks elsewhere.
The recommendations have been submitted to the cabinet for approval, Mira Acharya, who oversees climbing activities for the Nepal government’s Department of Tourism, told Reuters last week. The government has not given a time frame for the introduction of new laws.
Viesturs, who has an extensive history on Everest, said the proposed changes did not do enough to tackle the “group think” pack mentality that led to the traffic jam in late May, a problem he said also needed to be addressed by climb leaders at base camp.
“I know several climbers who waited until later and had the mountain almost to themselves,” Viesturs said of this year’s climbing season. “We really need to answer why so many people are on the summit ridge on the same day? How can you control it?”

159,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/charity-sues-kenya-over-treatment-of-trafficked-indian-nepali-women/,"NAIROBI: A charity said on Monday it is suing the Kenyan government over a failure to provide five women trafficked from India and Nepal for sexual exploitation with appropriate care after they were rescued.
HAART Kenya said a decision to make the three Nepali and two Indian women rescued from a Nairobi bar in August stay and testify against their alleged traffickers had caused them psychological harm.
“After four months, the victims just want to go home. They have become deeply traumatised and suicidal … some have been hospitalised,” said Sophie Otiende, programme consultant for HAART Kenya, which has rented a safe house for the victims.
“So we have filed a complaint against the government so that all victims of trafficking are not compelled to testify, and the government pays for their speedy and safe repatriation.”
The government has said it hopes to repatriate the five women, aged in their early to mid-twenties, in the coming days.
The petition, due to be heard on Tuesday, states that Kenya’s attorney general, inspector general of police and director of public prosecutions violated an anti-trafficking law that says victims have a right to privacy and safe repatriation.
It also calls on authorities to pay expenses of more than 1.3 million Kenyan shillings ($12,830) incurred by the charity for the care of the victims, which the law says is the state’s responsibility.
Kenyan government officials denied a lack of care and said no request for funds had been received.
“We have received requests from other charities which are being considered. If HAART approached us, we would of course consider providing funds for these victims,” said Elizabeth Mbuka, Head of the Counter Trafficking in Persons Secretariat.
Mbuka said a court order for the repatriation of the five women had now been given.
BOLLYWOOD BARS
A rising number of women and girls are leaving South Asian nations such as Nepal, India and Pakistan to work in Bollywood-style dance bars in Kenya’s adult entertainment industry – many illegally – according to anti-trafficking activists and police.
There is no official data, but the results of police raids combined with figures on repatriation of rescued women suggest scores of women and underage girls are victims of organised human trafficking from South Asia to Kenya.
Common in India, so-called mujra dance bars – where young women dance to Bollywood music for money from male patrons – have mushroomed in cities including Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, where large numbers of Kenyans of South Asian descent live.
Police and anti-trafficking groups have repeatedly voiced concerns that some of these private clubs are used as a front to ensnare women and girls, some in sex slavery, with women forced to pay off loans by erotic dancing or having sex with clients.
An official from the Indian High Commission in Nairobi said there had been “a few” cases involving the trafficking of Indian women to Kenyan dance bars.
“Whenever there is a case, we request consular access and provide whatever support we can to the victims,” said the official, who did not want to be named.
“We try to ensure that all Indian nationals go back as soon as possible, but we can only do this when the court orders this in the host country.”

TIRANA/THUMANE: At least 13 people were killed when the most powerful earthquake to hit Albania in decades shook the capital Tirana and the country’s west and north on Tuesday, tearing down buildings and burying residents under rubble.
Residents, some carrying babies, fled apartment buildings in Tirana and the western port of Durres after the 6.4 magnitude quake struck shortly before 4 a.m. (0300 GMT).
In the northern town of Thumane, Marjana Gjoka, 48, was sleeping in her apartment on the fourth floor of a five-storey building when the quake shattered the top floors.
“The roof collapsed on our head and I don’t know how we escaped. God helped us,” said Gjoka, whose three-year-old niece was among four people in the apartment when the quake struck.
The quake was centred 30 km (19 miles) west of Tirana, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said, and was also felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia.
Hours later a magnitude 5.4 earthquake hit Bosnia, with an epicentre 75 km (45 miles) south of Sarajevo, monitors said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
Five people were found dead in the rubble of apartment buildings in the northern Albanian town of Thumane and a man died in the town of Kurbin after jumping out of a building, a Defence Ministry spokeswoman said.
Seven bodies were pulled from collapsed buildings in Durres, the main port and tourism destination, the Defence Ministry said, adding 39 had been pulled out alive from under the ruins.
Defence Minister Olta Xhacka said 135 people were injured.
Firefighters, police and civilians were removing the debris from collapsed buildings in Thumane. Most of the buildings that collapsed were built of bricks, a Reuters reporter said.
Rescuers in Thumane used a mechanical digger to claw at collapsed masonry and remove a tangle of metal and cables. Others groped with bare hands to clear rubble.
Two people were pulled from rubble in Thumane four hours after the quake, a Reuters reporter said. Doctors said they were in a bad condition.
“Everything at home kept falling down,” Refik, a Tirana resident, said of the impact on his sixth-floor apartment.
“We were awake because of the previous quakes, but the last one shook us around,” he told Reuters, referring to smaller tremors recorded in the hour before the main quake.
Rescuers told local media one of the dead was an elderly woman who saved her grandson by cradling him with her body.
TRAPPED
Xhacka said the quake’s epicentre was in Durres. It was followed by 100 aftershocks.
“Durres and Thumane are the areas worst hit. Rescue-and-save work continues in the collapsed buildings there,” she said as troops pulled a victim from a hotel in Durres.
At least 135 people were injured, with 72 hospitalized, Xhacka said. Two planes from fellow NATO-member Romania were expected to land with specialized search and rescue equipment and help was coming from Italy and Turkey, Xhacka said.
Greece had sent emergency services for search and rescue operations, its premier’s office said.
“Firefighters and army staff are helping residents under the rubble”, in Durres and Thumane, the Defence Ministry said.
An unidentified man, with a wound dressing on his right cheek, told News24 TV his daughter and niece were among those trapped in a collapsed apartment building in Durres.
“I talked with my daughter and niece on the phone. They said they are well and are waiting for the rescue. Could not talk to my wife. There are other families, but I could not talk to them,” the man said.
Located along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, between Greece and Macedonia, Albania experiences regular seismic activity.
An earthquake of 5.6 magnitude shook the country on Sept. 21, damaging around 500 houses and destroying some. The Defence Ministry had said it was the most powerful quake in Albania in the last 30 years.
The images of collapsed buildings in urban areas suggested Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than one in 1979 which razed a neighbourhood of a northern town. Neither of those two earlier earthquakes caused fatalities.
The Balkan nation is the poorest country in Europe, with an average income of less than a third of the European Union average, according to Eurostat data.

SYDNEY: Firefighters battled hundreds of bushfires across Australia on Thursday as scores of blazes sprang up in new locations, triggering warnings that it was too late for some residents to evacuate.
As Thick smoke blanketed the most populous city of Sydney for a third day, residents were urged to keep children indoors, stepping up pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to tackle climate change.
By early afternoon, dozens of fires were burning across the southeastern state of Victoria and temperatures of 40.9 Celsius (105.6 F) in Melbourne, its capital, matched the hottest day on record in 1894, Australia‘s weather bureau said.
Authorities warned residents of towns about 50 km (31 miles) north of Ballarat, the state’s third largest city, that it was too late for them to evacuate safely.
“You are in danger, act now to protect yourself,” fire authorities said in an alert. “It is too late to leave. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately.”
Blazes across several states have endangered thousands of people, killing at least four people this month, burning about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroying more than 400 homes.
The early arrival and severity of the fires in the southern hemisphere spring follows three years of drought that experts have linked to climate change and which have left bushland tinder-dry.
With 10 days remaining to the official start of summer, extreme temperatures and high winds have sparked wildfires in new areas, even as firefighters tracked the crisis across the mainland, the Northern Territory and the island of Tasmania.
In Victoria, power to more than 100,000 homes was knocked out amid lightning strikes and strong, gusty winds of more than 110 kph (68 mph) that knocked tree branches into power lines, ahead of a cool change expected to bring relief in the evening.
The extensive damage was likely to leave some customers without power through the night as utilities worked to restore networks and fix downed powerlines, a spokeswoman for power provider Ausnet said.
State authorities issued its first Code Red alert in a decade, signifying the worst possible bushfire conditions, warning that should a fire start it would be fast moving, unpredictable and probably uncontrollable.
In the state of New South Wales, strong winds blew smoke from 60 fires still burning over much of Sydney, shrouding the harbour city and its famous landmarks in thick smog.
The state imposed tough new water curbs in Sydney from Dec. 10, when a key dam is expected to be down to 45% capacity. Residents face fines if they use hoses to water their gardens and wash their cars.
CLIMATE POLITICS
The unrelenting conditions have sharpened attention on the climate change policies of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who rejected any link.
“Climate change is a global phenomenon, and we’re doing our bit as part of the response to climate change,” Morrison told ABC radio.
“To suggest that, with just 1.3% of global emissions, that Australia doing something differently – more or less – would have changed the fire outcome this season, I don’t think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all.”
Morrison’s conservative government has committed to the Paris Agreement for a cut in emissions from 26% to 28% by 2030, versus 2005 levels. Critics say current projections suggest it will miss that target and have urged remedial steps.

162,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/singapore-court-to-hear-legal-challenges-on-gay-sex-ban/,"KUALA LUMPUR: As a Singapore court prepares to hear a series of legal challenges to a law that bans gay sex, LGBT+ activists on Tuesday called for the “right” verdict to be delivered so similar reforms can be triggered across other parts of Asia.
Like many other former British colonies, Singapore has retained an old law that criminalises gay sex, which was scrapped by India in a landmark court ruling last year to give a boost to LGBT+ rights.
Empowered by the Indian ruling, three Singaporean activists have launched separate bids in a renewed push to decriminalise gay sex in the city-state, where a high court is due to begin hearing their cases on Wednesday.
“I think public opinion is pretty clear across religious and age segments that homosexuality should not be a criminal offence,” Johnson Ong Ming, who was among the trio, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Ong, a DJ also known as DJ Big Kid, was the first to launch the case in September last year. The former head of a LGBT+ rights charity and a retired doctor also filed similar lawsuits later.
“I have full confidence in our judicial system and I am hopeful that the court will come to the right decision … and overturn Section 377A,” Ong said by email.
The court has set aside six days in November for the legal challenges to be heard but it is unclear when the proceedings will wrap up.
Under Section 377A of Singapore’s Penal Code, a man found to have committed an act of “gross indecency” with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare. The law does not apply to homosexual acts between women.
Singapore has emerged as a modern nation since independence six decades ago but socially it remains conservative, partly due to sensitivities stemming from multi-religious groups among its 5.6 million population.
Previous legal challenges to overturn the ban have failed, although recent opinion polls indicated there has been growing support for gay rights.
Opposition to gay marriage had fallen to 60%, down from 74% in 2013, according to a poll of more than 4,000 people published in May by the Institute of Policy Studies, a Singapore think-tank.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong however has previously said that Singapore society “is not that liberal on these matters”.
The Singapore court cases are being closely watched by LGBT+ groups in some other parts of Asia that have maintained the colonial-era law, including in Myanmar and Malaysia.
“If the decision in Singapore goes our way, then it will boost our morale here in Malaysia,” said Numan Afifi, president of the LGBT+ advocacy Pelangi Campaign in Malaysia.
Aung Myo Min, executive director from the Yangon-based Equality Myanmar LGBT+ campaign group said both Singapore and Myanmar “should follow the example of India” and repeal the archaic law.
Gay sex is a crime in both countries, with those convicted facing sentences of up to 10 years in jail in Myanmar and 20 years in Malaysia.

163,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/at-least-40-killed-as-fresh-protests-engulf-iraq-3/,"BAGHDAD: At least 40 protesters were killed in Iraq on Friday when security forces used tear gas and an Iranian-backed militia opened fire to try to quell renewed demonstrations against corruption and economic hardship, security sources said.

A government intelligence officer and a member of the powerful Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia were killed in a clash with protesters in the southern city of Amara, police sources said.
More than 2,000 people were injured nationwide, according to medical sources and the Iraqi High Commission on Human Rights (IHCHR), as demonstrators vented frustration at political elites they say have failed to improve their lives after years of conflict.
“All we want are four things: jobs, water, electricity, and safety. That’s all we want,” said 16-year-old Ali Mohammed who had covered his face with a T-shirt to avoid inhaling tear gas, as chaotic scenes overwhelmed Baghdad‘s central Tahrir Square.
Sirens wailed and tear gas canisters landed amid groups of young protesters draped in Iraqi flags and chanting “with life and blood we defend you Iraq.”
The bloodshed is the second major bout of violence this month. A series of clashes two weeks ago between protesters and security forces left 157 people dead and over 6,000 wounded.
The unrest has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which lived through foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State (IS) insurgency between 2003 and 2017. It is the biggest challenge to security since IS was declared beaten.
On Friday, eight protesters were killed in Baghdad, the IHCHR said. At least five of them were protesters struck by tear gas canisters, security sources said.
In the south, at least nine protesters were killed when members of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) militia opened fire on protesters who tried to set fire to the group’s office in the city of Nasiriya, according to security sources.
Eight people were killed in Amara city, including six protesters, one AAH member and one intelligence officer, police sources said. Three protesters were killed in oil-rich Basra, one in Hilla, and one in Samawa, security sources said.
In Diwaniya city, twelve protesters died after being trapped in a burning building, morgue officials and police sources said.
The building, which housed the local offices of the Iran-backed Badr Organisation, was apparently torched by protesters unaware that others were already inside.
Interior Ministry spokesman Khalid al-Muhanna said at least 68 members of the security forces were injured.
The sometimes violent demonstrations erupted in Baghdad on October 1 and spread to southern cities.
They pose the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi since he took office just a year ago. Despite promising reforms and ordering a broad cabinet reshuffle, he has so far struggled to address the protesters’ discontent.
POVERTY, DESPITE OIL WEALTH
Despite the OPEC member country’s vast oil wealth, many Iraqis live in poverty, have limited access to clean water, electricity, basic healthcare or decent education as the country tries to recover from years of conflict and economic hardship.
Many Iraqis view the elite as subservient to one or other of Iraq’s two main allies, the United States and Iran. Many suspect these powers use Iraq to pursue their struggle for regional influence via proxies unconcerned with ordinary people’s needs.
“They hit us last night and again this morning. We don’t have any demands anymore, we want the government toppled,” said demonstrator Salah Mohammad.
“We want Iran to take its parties and leave, America to take its parties and leave, and let the Iraqi people decide.”
In Basra, Reuters footage showed protesters clashing with security forces who launched tear gas canisters and stun grenades and were met by rocks thrown at their vehicles. Young men carried the injured away, as protesters set police cars on fire.
An 8 pm curfew was imposed until further notice in the southern provinces of Basra, Muthanna, Wasit, Babel and Dhi Qar, after protesters torched offices of lawmakers, Shi’ite political parties and militia headquarters.
How the government and security forces handled Friday’s planned protests had been seen as a litmus test for the stability of the country with political leaders already on edge.
RAGE AGAINST THE ELITE
In a Thursday night address, Abdul Mahdi stressed that violence would not be tolerated and warned that any collapse of the government would drag Iraq into further turmoil.
Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who in recent weeks criticised the government’s handling of the protests, urged calm on all sides during his sermon on Friday.
In Baghdad, many demonstrators initially believed authorities would refrain from violence after security forces killed dozens of protesters earlier this month.
Hundreds tried throughout the day to march into the city’s fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies, when they were stopped by security forces.
By afternoon, the mood had shifted with thousands of angry protesters wrapped in Iraqi flags under pouring rain, chanting that they were peaceful and calling political leaders corrupt.
As clashes broke out, tuk-tuks carried the injured to hospitals. Medical sources told Reuters hundreds of people had been treated for injuries, most related to tear gas exposure.

164,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/indian-muslims-anxious-as-court-prepares-to-rule-on-destroyed-mosque/,"
AYODHYA: In the Indian town of Ayodhya, minority Muslims are feeling under siege as they await a Supreme Court ruling on a centuries-old religious dispute that has cast a shadow over their relations with the majority Hindu community.
After a tangle of legal cases, the Supreme Court in August decided to hear arguments every day in an effort to resolve the dispute over what should be built on the ruins of the 16th-century Babri Masjid, destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992.
The uproar over the mosque triggered some of India‘s deadliest riots, in which nearly 2,000 people, most of them Muslim, were killed.
The bloody controversy raised lingering questions about the role of religion in the officially secular country, and the place of Muslims in it.
Last month, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi finished the hearings and is expected to pronounce his verdict in the next couple of weeks.
Whichever way it goes, the decision is likely to have a significant impact on the fraught relationship between India‘s Hindus and Muslims, who constitute 14% of its 1.3 billion people.
While most Muslim religious leaders want the mosque to be rebuilt, Hindus say there is evidence there was a temple on the site before the mosque was built in 1528 by a commander of Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty.
Construction of a “grand temple” in Ayodhya has long been an election promise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won a second term with a landslide this year.
Fearing tension after the court decision, Mohammed Shahid, 48, the grandson of the mosque’s last Imam, or prayer leader, has decided to move his family away.
He has reason to be afraid.
Shahid’s father, Mohammed Shabir, was killed by a mob of Hindus who rampaged through Ayodhya before tearing down the mosque on Dec. 6, 1992.
“In 1992, we decided to stay put – a decision that we live to regret,” Shahid said, sitting in the courtyard of his run-down, two-storied house.
“Other than killing my father, they set ablaze our house and a sawmill, our only source of income.”
‘BAD ELEMENTS’
Shahid said he was glad that his grandfather, who had died in 1990, did not see the destruction of the mosque.
Unlike Shahid, Haji Mahboob Ahmad, a 66-year-old Muslim community leader who lives near the site, doesn’t plan to leave.
But he shares Shahid’s anxiety.
“We’re conscious of the fact that some bad elements can try to foment trouble by taking advantage of the situation and that’s why I’ve requested authorities to ensure the safety of Ayodhya’s Muslims,” Ahmad said.
Ahmad said India‘s founding fathers established it as a secular democracy, and it must remain that.
The day Shahid’s father was killed, Hindu Hajari Lal, 57, escaped death.
Lal was among the hundreds of Hindus who destroyed the mosque with shovels, hammers and their bare hands, bringing down its domes before the whole structure collapsed.
Unfortunately for Lal, part of the building fell on him, trapping him in the rubble with broken bones.
“Since that fateful day of 1992, the only objective of my life is to see a permanent temple on the site. I can die in peace if I get to see the temple,” Lal said.
‘ENDLESSLY WAITING’
For Hindus, Lal said, the site in Ayodhya was as sacred as Mecca is in Islam.
That’s because Lal and millions of other Hindus believe the mosque was built at the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities.
Lal helps to guide a steady stream of pilgrims who come to see a model of what they hope will become a new temple.
Visitors can also look at an open field of masonry, in pink sandstone, including piles of ornately carved columns. Concrete pillars and blocks for foundations are also ready.
“Once the court green-lights construction of the temple, we can quickly move these concrete blocks from the workshop to the temple site,” said Sharad Sharma, spokesman for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council.
Top politicians, including some cabinet ministers, regularly visit Ayodhya to pay their respect to Nritya Gopal Das, an influential monk and chairman of a trust committed to building the temple.
“I’m sure Modi ji is aware of the sentiments of millions of Hindus who have been endlessly waiting to see the Ram temple,” said Das, using an honorific for Modi.

Canada named top country for social entrepreneurs
United States suffers biggest fall amid political uncertainty
More youth interest in working for businesses that do good



LONDON: Canada was named the best country for business leaders seeking to tackle social problems in a global poll on Tuesday while the United States fell from top slot due to political uncertainty.
Australia came second in the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s second global survey on the best countries for social entrepreneurs, seeing the biggest gain of 24 places from the inaugural poll in 2016, while France came third.
Mexico came last, down 15 places from 2016, but the United States was the biggest loser, plunging to 32nd place from No. 1, with the poll of about 900 social enterprise experts pointing to difficulties with government policy and access to investment.
Francois Bonnici, head of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, said over the past three years there had been “some amazing gains and some ongoing challenges” for social entrepreneurs addressing issues from climate change to refugees.
“Governments are recognising that to meet their own agendas this is a group of citizens and entrepreneurs that actually want to improve society and the environment,” said Bonnici.
“But it has a slightly different flavour in each country and that government role is important (as it) can legitimise the sector in their country by creating these policies.”
Business entrepreneurs globally are increasingly setting their sights on social problems with ventures that can be a commercial success while addressing problems like unemployment, homelessness, mental health, knife crime and even loneliness.
For example in South Africa social enterprise Harambee has created a ‘dating service’ to match unemployed youth with employers, while in India Project Patradya is tackling the waste problem by employing Afghan refugee women to make edible bowls.
But with little data on which nations were encouraging the sector, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in partnership with Deutsche Bank, began a poll in 2016 which was repeated in 2019. Social entrepreneurs, academics, investors and support agencies in the world’s 45 biggest economies, as ranked by the World Bank, were asked their views. Iran and Saudi Arabia were dropped in 2019 as it was impossible to get the right sample.
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
The 2019 poll found most experts, 82%, said social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum in their countries – although this was down three percentage points from 2016.
Canada, Indonesia and South Africa were named as the top countries where social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum, while Mexico, the United States and China saw the biggest falls.
Despite this, more than half of respondents – 54% – said the public still did not understand what they did which was not helped by the lack of a global definition of social enterprise. Italians were most aware of their work and Poles the least.
“People are becoming aware that the whole notion of social entrepreneurship is not just kumbaya,” said former Bangladeshi-U.S. investment banker Durreen Shahnaz, founder of the first social stock exchange, Impact Investment Exchange (IIX).
“It really is about doing serious work and making sure that work is scalable … There are signs the industry is maturing.”
The rising interest of young people – under the age of 25 – was a new finding, with three in four experts saying more young people were interested in working in social enterprises.
Indonesian social entrepreneur Denica Flesch wanted a career where she had a direct impact in the fight against poverty so in 2016, aged 26, she founded SukkhaCitta, an online marketplace selling clothes made by female artisans in Indonesian villages. “Young people are really challenging the notion of work, and combining purpose and career in one place,” said Flesch.
“They’re more idealistic and want to do something that’s beyond just looking for money.”
Canada was named as the top country where young people were playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs, followed by Germany and France, as well as the top place for women leaders.
WOMEN TAKING A LEAD
“Culturally we are about diversity and inclusion at a national level. That’s our brand, so that is helpful for the environment for social enterprise,” said Marcia Nozick, founder and chief executive of Vancouver-based social enterprise EMBERS.
She said policies that encouraged governments to buy the services of social impact ventures had been vital in helping the growth of EMBERS, which finds flexible jobs for people in a deprived part of Vancouver.
Nozick said there were many female leaders because it was “about caring and relationships and that has always been at the forefront of what women have brought to the business sector”.
Women were also seen as playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs in Australia, Belgium, Sweden and Malaysia.
The United States was named the worst place for female social entrepreneurs – the same as in 2016 – while Argentina and China slumped the most in questions regarding women in the poll conducted online and by telephone between May 7 and July 30.
The biggest falls for the United States overall related to access to investment, selling to businesses and supportive government policy.
Attracting investment continued to be a challenge, according to 56% of experts, down two percentage points from 2016.
Bonnie Chiu, founder and chief executive of Lensational, a social enterprise that trains marginalised women as photographers, said there was more capital available to social entrepreneurs but they had to jump through hoops to get it.
“So much time is spent chasing these opportunities,” said Chiu, whose business is based in Britain and Hong Kong.
“Traditional businesses just need to prove that they are financially sound, traditional charities just need to prove that they are generating social impact – but social enterprises need to do both.”
But regardless of the problems getting political support, financing or selling to businesses, experts said there would always be a need for social entrepreneurs to address the world’s largest problems where markets or public policy had failed.
“The more our political leaders might struggle to solve the world’s most pressing problems, the more opportunity for social entrepreneurs to come up with solutions,” said Jude O’Reilly, a senior director at U.S. nonprofit the Skoll Foundation.

OTTAWA: Canadians began voting on Monday to determine whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept into office four years ago as a charismatic figure promising “sunny ways,” will remain in power after two major scandals.
Polls opened in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland, with voting set to end in the Pacific Coast province of British Columbia at 7 p.m. (0200 GMT on Tuesday).
Trudeau, 47, the Liberal Party leader, was endorsed by former Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama in the final stretch of the campaign and is viewed as one of the last remaining progressive leaders among the world’s major democracies.
But he was shaken during the campaign by a blackface scandal and has been dogged by criticism of his handling of a corruption case involving a major Canadian construction company. Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has also had to overcome a sense of fatigue with his government.
Trudeau, accompanied by his wife and three children, voted in Montreal on Monday after a marathon sprint campaigning across the country in the past four days.
His Liberals and the main opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer are in a neck-and-neck race, according to opinion polls.
“The truth is it’s a coin toss right now,” said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker.
A year ago, no one would have predicted that Trudeau risked being the first prime minister since the 1930s to secure a parliamentary majority and then fail to win a second term.
The latest opinion polls suggest he may narrowly avert that result and could return to office with a minority in the 338-seat House of Commons. That would still leave Trudeau in a weakened position and needing the support of left-leaning opposition parties to push through key pieces of legislation.
The Canadian dollar was trading at a new three-month high on Monday, where “domestic attention is squarely on the 43rd federal election today,” said Shaun Osborne, chief market strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
“After some noise around the vote, we think FX players will refocus attention on the Bank of Canada policy outlook, the Fed and international backdrop pretty quickly,” he said.
Despite Scheer’s dimpled smile, Trudeau’s main rival has proven to be a determined opponent.
“He can’t even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he’s always wearing a mask,” Scheer said during a debate. “Mr. Trudeau, you are a phony and you are a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country.”
In his bid to unseat Trudeau, Scheer is also promising to balance the federal budget and eliminate a “carbon tax” on fossil fuels. Scheer, 40, is running his first campaign as party leader after winning a bitter Conservative leadership fight in 2017.
BUMPY CAMPAIGN RIDE
The six-week official campaign period has been a rough and meandering ride with dirty tactics on both sides.
The liberal image of Trudeau, who has championed diversity as prime minister and whose father opened up the country to mass immigration, took a severe blow when pictures emerged early in the campaign of him wearing blackface in the early 1990s and in 2001.
Trudeau had already been wrestling with the fallout from accusations he pressured his justice minister to help shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc from corruption charges. In August, a top watchdog said Trudeau breached ethics rules.
Given the fact that neither of the front-runners could come away with a parliamentary majority, it is the smaller left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) or the separatist Bloc Quebecois that could end up holding the balance of power.
“I am a lifelong Liberal voter and I am stumped on this one, mostly because I am really concerned about a Conservative win and just trying to figure out how to vote strategically,” said Kristin Street, 33, a strategy manager at a computer games company, in Port Moody, British Columbia.
EKOS Research pollster Frank Graves said Liberals needed turnout to be similar to four years ago or otherwise the Conservatives may have an edge.
“We may well be waiting until the final vote tallies in British Columbia to see who will win on Monday,” Graves said.

JAKARTA: Indonesian authorities said on Thursday more than 11,500 people have been evacuated from the town of Wamena in the easternmost province of Papua since dozens died during clashes last month in the area.
Located on the western half of the island of New Guinea and long racked by a simmering separatist insurgency, Papua encompasses Indonesia’s two easternmost provinces and has a distinct ethnic Melanesian population.
There has been a spike in protests and unrest since late August after Papuan students in Surabaya, Indonesia’s second city on the island of Java, were taunted and attacked by a mob chanting racial epithets over accusations they had desecrated a national flag.
In some of the worst bloodshed in decades in Papua, 33 people died and scores were hurt during clashes in Wamena on Sept. 23.
Government offices and homes were burned down, and 250 cars and motorcycles destroyed, as indigenous Papuans and security forces clashed.
The government and some Papuan independence activists say 25 of the 33 who died there were migrants from elsewhere in the country.
Erizal, 42, a former resident of Wamena who had left, said his child and wife died during the unrest and he now felt too traumatised to consider returning to the town.
“I am in my village in Padang now, maybe I will not return back to Wamena,” he said by telephone from the Padang area on Sumatra island where he was originally from.
He said his shop had also been burnt down in the unrest.
Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 2 Indonesia‘s air force had flown 7,467 people out of Wamena on Hercules planes, while 4,179 people had left on commercial flights, said Harry Hikmat, an official at Indonesia‘s social ministry.
Ahmad Musthofa Kamal, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said the situation in Wamane was now stable and that shops and markets were open again.
A former Dutch colony, Papua was formally incorporated into Indonesia in 1969, after a disputed vote of about 1,025 hand-picked tribal leaders. The result of the plebiscite was overseen and endorsed by the United Nations.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has opened the door to holding talks with separatists in Papua, a departure from the stance of previous governments and some of his cabinet ministers.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong police fired water cannon, rubber bullets and round after round of tear gas at petrol-bomb and brick-throwing protesters on Sunday in some of the most widespread violence in more than three months of anti-government unrest.
Running battles in the Causeway Bay shopping district, Wan Chai bar area and the Admiralty district of central government offices followed a night of showdowns with police in the Chinese-ruled city after a peaceful pro-democracy rally turned ugly on the streets outside.
More protests are planned in the run-up to China’s Oct. 1 National Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.
Police also fired tear gas from the roof of the Legislative Council building, which activists trashed and daubed with graffiti weeks ago.
Protesters, many of them wearing their trademark black with face masks, took cover from the tear gas behind umbrellas and held their ground on Sunday, some throwing tear gas canisters back at police as a helicopter flew overhead.
They built barricades with trolleys and trash cans and other debris. One threw a petrol bomb at police in the Wan Chai metro station.
At least one petrol bomb landed in the grounds of central government offices where several windows were smashed.
Police, who traditionally raise placards warning of retaliation before firing tear gas or firing water cannon, made several arrests, grappling people to the tarmac. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.
The water cannon fired blue dye, which elsewhere in the world is used to make identification of offenders easier.
The government said that the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, will be out of town for China’s National Day, despite her having sent out invitations for celebrations at home.
Some shops closed ahead of expected demonstrations, while the MTR metro service shut stations, a move that has made it a target of violence in the past.
Protesters shouted anti-China slogans and called for their “five demands, not one less” of the government, including universal suffrage and the dropping of all charges against their arrested colleagues.
About 200 China supporters dressed in red T-shirts gathered on top of Victoria Peak, overlooking the harbour, at around midday. They sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted “I love China”.
Angela, a housewife in her 40s, a Chinese flag sticker plastered on her cheek, said the pro-democracy protesters were “thugs”.
“If the government takes violent action I don’t object,” she said. “We have tolerated enough. I think I have emotional problems because of the riots. Because it’s not safe to go out.”
CHANGE OF HEART
Lam, the focus of weeks of anti-government unrest, will leave for Beijing on Monday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic the following day.
Lam, who was trapped in an indoor stadium by street protests for hours this week after an “open dialogue” with the people, will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night overland, minimising the chances of a clash at the airport, a popular target of anti-government protests.
She had sent out invitations “requesting the pleasure of your company” at a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Tuesday.
It was not immediately clear why she had the change of heart but the government said Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung would stand in for her.
Arthur, 40, wearing glasses and a mask covering the lower half of his face, said Lam’s trip was expected.
“In these three months, Carrie Lam has not really cared about the protesters. She only cares about the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) or what we might call ‘her boss’,” he said. “I think Hong Kong is somehow at this moment the frontline between Western democracy and the dictatorship in China…. Hong Kong looks more and more like a police state.”
Police fired tear gas and water cannon on Saturday night to disperse protesters who threw petrol bombs and rocks, broke government office windows and blocked a key road near the local headquarters of China’s People’s Liberation Army.
Anti-government protesters have attacked the legislature, Beijing’s main Liaison Office, occupied the airport, thrown petrol bombs at police, vandalised metro stations and set street fires in the former British colony.
Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.
The protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.
China dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.
Protests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement. Rallies in support of the anti-government protesters were held in Australia’s largest cities, with the biggest in Sydney.
Many wore face masks to hide their identity and crowds yelled “stand with Hong Kong” and “fight for freedom”, while placards depicted Chinese President Xi Jinping with a cross marked across his face.

NEW YORK: Earth is in more hot water than ever before, and so are we, an expert United Nations climate panel warned in a grim new report Wednesday.
Sea levels are rising at an ever-faster rate as ice and snow shrink, and oceans are getting more acidic and losing oxygen, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report issued as world leaders met at the United Nations.
The agency warned that if steps aren’t taken to reduce emissions and slow global warming, seas will rise 3 feet by the end of the century, with many fewer fish, less snow and ice, stronger and wetter hurricanes and other, nastier weather systems.
“The oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble, and that means we’re all in big trouble, too,” said one of the report’s lead authors, Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “The changes are accelerating.”
The dire effects will be felt on both land and sea, harming people, plants, animals, food, societies, infrastructure and the global economy. In fact, the international team of scientists projected for the first time that some island nations will probably become uninhabitable.
The oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat from carbon pollution in the air, as well as much of the carbon dioxide itself. Earth’s snow and ice, called the cryosphere, are also being eroded.
“The world’s oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe,” said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a deputy assistant administrator for research at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The report found:
Seas are now rising at one-seventh of an inch (3.66 millimeters) a year, which is 2.5 times faster than the rate from 1900 to 1990.
The world’s oceans have already lost 1% to 3% of the oxygen in their upper levels since 1970 and will lose more as warming continues.
From 2006 to 2015, the ice melting from Greenland, Antarctica and the world’s mountain glaciers has accelerated. They are now losing 720 billion tons (653 billion metric tons) of ice a year.
Arctic June snow cover has shrunk more than half since 1967, down nearly 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).
Arctic sea ice in September, the annual low point, is down almost 13% per decade since 1979. This year’s low, reported Monday, tied for the second-lowest on record.
Marine animals are likely to decrease 15%, and catches by fisheries in general are expected to decline 21% to 24%, by the end of century because of climate change.
“Climate change is already irreversible,” French climate scientist Valérie Masson-Delmotte, a report lead author, said at a news conference in Monaco, where the document was released. “Due to the heat uptake in the ocean, we can’t go back.”
But many of the worst-case projections in the report can still be avoided, depending on how the world handles the emissions of heat-trapping gases, the report’s authors said.
The IPCC increased its projected end-of-century sea level rise in the worst-case scenario by nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) from its 2013 projections because of the increased recent melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.
The new report projects that, under the business-as-usual scenario for carbon emissions, seas by the end of the century will rise between 2 feet (61 centimeters) and 43 inches (110 centimeters), with a most likely rise of 33 inches (84 centimeters). This is slightly less than the traditional 1 meter (39 inches) that scientists often use.
And sea level will rise two to three times as much over the centuries to come if warming continues, so the world is looking at a “future that certainly looks completely different than what we currently have,” said report co-author Hans-Otto Portner, a German climate scientist.
The Nobel Prize-winning IPCC requires that its reports be unanimously approved. Because of that, its reports tend to show less sea level rise and smaller harm than other scientific studies, outside experts said.
“Like many of the past reports, this one is conservative in the projections, especially in how much ice can be lost in Greenland and Antarctica,” said NASA oceanographer Josh Willis, who studies Greenland ice melt and wasn’t part of the report.
Willis said people should be prepared for a rise in sea levels to be twice these IPCC projections.
The world’s warm water coral reefs will go extinct in some places and be dramatically different in others, the report said.
“We are already seeing the demise of the warm water coral reefs,” Portner said. “That is one of the strongest warning signals that we have available.”
Outside scientists praised the work but were disturbed by it.
“It is alarming to read such a thorough cataloging of all of the serious changes in the planet that we’re driving,” said Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler. “What’s particularly disturbing as a scientist is that virtually all of these changes were predicted years or decades ago.”
The report’s authors emphasized that it doesn’t doom Earth to this gloomy future.
“We indicate we have a choice. Whether we go into a grim future depends on the decisions that are being made,” Portner said.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump welcomed Australia’s prime minister on Friday for only the second state visit of his administration, signaling the close bond between the two allies as Washington takes on Beijing and Tehran.
Trump and Scott Morrison are expected to discuss security and trade, as China’s increasing assertiveness, especially in the energy-rich South China Sea, has raised concerns within the region and the United States.
The leaders are also set to release a plan on Friday aimed at securing the supply of rare earth minerals, as concerns grow that China, the world’s largest processor and producer of the minerals, could cut off shipments of the prized commodities.
Days before the visit, a sign draped across the Australian Embassy in Washington proclaimed “100 years of mateship” between the two countries. On Friday, Trump feted Morrison’s arrival at the White House’s South Lawn with a 19-gun salute and US Marine Band performances of each nation’s national anthems.
“It’s highly symbolic of where the relationship sits at the moment,” said Patrick Buchan, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting that Morrison’s state visit was second only to French President Emmanuel Macron’s last year.
“Australia played a very smart game with Trump,” he added, noting the country had avoiding directly criticizing him, unlike some European counterparts.
Trump got off to a smooth start with Morrison in May, congratulating him on his surprise election victory in a tweet noting there were “no greater friends” than the United States and Australia.
The two also met on the sidelines of the G20 in June, cementing warm ties that Trump did not enjoy with Morrison’s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. Trump berated Turnbull in February 2017 over a bilateral refugee agreement before abruptly ending their telephone conversation.
Australia also agreed last month to join a coalition to protect oil tankers and cargo ships from threats posed by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz after a series of attacks there that Washington has blamed on Tehran.
Australia has also banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , the world’s top provider of telecoms equipment, from its 5G network, something the Trump administration has struggled to persuade other allies to do. The United States says Huawei’s ties to Beijing make the network equipment it sells to telecoms firms a security risk.
Australian intelligence concluded China was responsible for a cyberattack on Australia’s parliament and its three largest political parties, Reuters reported on Monday.
Following an arrival ceremony, bilateral meetings, and a joint news conference, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will host a luncheon for Morrison to be followed by a state dinner at the White House.
SECURITY AND TRADE
During a visit to Sydney last month by Pompeo and US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the United States and Australia pledged to strengthen opposition to Chinese activities in the Pacific.
China has unnerved the region and angered the United States by installing military equipment and other facilities on artificial islands it has made in the disputed South China Sea.
The United States and its Western allies also worry that China is using foreign aid to secure greater influence over small Pacific countries that control vast swath of resource-rich ocean.
Australia, traditionally the major power in the South Pacific, has promised up to A$3 billion ($2 billion) in grants and loans to counter what Washington describes as China’s “payday loan diplomacy.”
But Morrison has pressed Trump to end his trade war with China, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.

BEIJING: China expressed anger on Tuesday after German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas met prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, saying that no foreign country had a right to interfere in China’s internal affairs.
Wong met Maas on Monday in Berlin at an event hosted by the German newspaper BILD.
After being held for around 24 hours at the Hong Kong airport on Sunday for allegedly breaching the terms of his bail, Wong arrived in Berlin late on Monday evening, where he said he would “continue his battle for free elections”.
The timing is especially awkward as German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Beijing last week. Hong Kong has been gripped by weeks of protests, initially against a now-shelved extradition bill and now focused more on securing greater freedoms for Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China was “extremely dissatisfied and resolutely opposed” to German allowing Wong to visit and to allow him to meet the German foreign minister.
“China has already lodged stern representations with the German side,” Hua told a daily news briefing.
Hong Kong is an internal affair and no foreign government, organisation or individual has a right to interfere, she added.
“Any plots to rely on foreigners to build oneself up or acts or words to split the country are doomed to failure.”
Hua said that during her trip last week, Merkel clearly said that she opposes violence and supports “one country, two systems”.
Hong Kong returned to Beijing from British rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
“We can’t help but ask, what is the purpose of the German side in allowing Joshua Wong to come to Germany at this time and to meet with minister Maas?”
China urges Germany to abide by its promises and avoid sending wrong messages to separatist Hong Kong forces, and urges Maas to abide by the basics of international law and act for the benefit of relations and not be a “damager” of the relationship, Hua added.
Interference by foreign parliaments in Hong Kong‘s matters is deeply regrettable, the leader of the Chinese-ruled city said earlier on Tuesday, adding that an escalation of violence cannot solve social issues in the city.
Carrie Lam was speaking after another weekend of sometimes violent clashes in the former British colony, with police firing tear gas to disperse protesters in cat-and-mouse skirmishes, at times smashing windows and starting street fires.
Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding the autonomy they had been promised. China denies accusations of meddling in the city.

SRINAGAR: India on Sunday imposed curfews in several parts of the contested Kashmir region, after clashes between security forces and Shi’ite Muslims taking part in a procession, officials and eyewitnesses said.
At least 12 locals and six troops were injured on Saturday evening, officials told Reuters, as the worshippers on the traditional mourning procession of Muharram clashed with troops trying to stop it.
Troops used tear gas and pellet guns on the crowd, which insisted on carrying on with the procession, one in a series held at this time of the year, and pelted stones at security forces, an Indian official who declined to named told Reuters.
“The clashes continued till late night during which the troops fired tear gas and pellets,” he added.
A spokeswoman for India‘s interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
“Reasonable restrictions are necessary for peace and protection of life,” India‘s national security adviser had said on Saturday, accusing Islamabad of trying to stoke violence in the region.
Kashmir, a mountainous Muslim-majority region claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been the site of frequent altercations between security forces and locals protesting against New Delhi’s decision to revoke special rights for the portion of the territory that it controls on Aug. 5.
The most recent clashes occurred in Rainawari and Badgam, two Shi’ite majority areas of Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir’s main city.
The five km (3 mile) procession route that passes through the city centre has been barricaded by armed troops wearing helmets and bullet proof vests.
On Sunday, police vans fitted with loud speakers announced curfew-like restrictions in Srinagar’s city center Lal Chowk and adjacent areas, according to two Reuters witnesses.
“People are advised to stay indoors and not venture out of their home,” the police announced.
Suhail Ahmed, a Rainawari resident, said that there have been frequent clashes in the area for last three to four days as troops have been trying to block the procession.
“We hear deafening sounds of tear gas being fired for last few evenings. We mostly stay indoors but the gas comes into our homes making it difficult to sleep,” Ahmed said.
Muharram is the first month of the year according to the Muslim lunar calendar, and traditionally processions are held for the first 10 days of the month to observe the death of Prophet Muhammad’s nephew Imam Hussein, killed in battle in 680.
Shi’ite Muslims typically intensify their expression of suffering on the Ashura day, that this year falls on Tuesday.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests so the Chinese-ruled city can move forward from a “highly vulnerable and dangerous” place and find solutions.
Her televised announcement came after Reuters reports on Friday and Monday revealing that Beijing had thwarted an earlier proposal from Lam to withdraw the bill and that she had said privately that she would resign if she could, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters.
“Lingering violence is damaging the very foundations of our society, especially the rule of law,” a sombre Lam said as she sat wearing a navy blue jacket and pink shirt with her hands folded on a desk in front of her.
The withdrawal, a key demand of protesters but just one of five, came after unrest that drove the former British colony to the edge of anarchy as the government repeatedly refused to back down – igniting pitched battles across the city of seven million, the arrests of more than 1,000 protesters, and leaving a society deeply divided.
Many are furious about perceived police brutality and the number of arrests – 1,183 at the latest count – and want an independent inquiry.
“The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,” Lam said.
“I pledge that the government will seriously follow up the recommendations of the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Council) report. From this month, I and my principal officials will reach out to the community to start a direct dialogue … we must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions.”
The protests began in March but snowballed in June and have since evolved into a push for greater democracy for the city which returned to China in 1997.
The bill would have allowed extraditions to mainland China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
It was not immediately clear if killing the bill would help end the unrest. The immediate reaction appeared sceptical and the real test will be how many people take to the streets.
Some lawmakers said the move should have come earlier.
“The damage has been done. The scars and wounds are still bleeding,” said pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo. “She thinks she can use a garden hose to put out a hill fire. That’s not going to be acceptable.”
WINNING OVER MODERATES?
In the voice recording obtained by Reuters, Lam said at a meeting last week that her room to find a political solution to the crisis was “very limited”, as authorities in Beijing now viewed the situation as a matter of national security.
Beijing’s apparent endorsement of the withdrawal of the bill comes after the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rule since he took power in 2012.
Others said the move was not enough.
“This won’t appease the protesters,” said Boris Chen, 37, who works in financial services. “In any kind of time, people will find something they can get angry about.”
Pro-Beijing lawmaker Cheung Kwok-kwan said Lam’s announcement was not a compromise to appease those promoting violence, but a bid to win over moderates in the protest camp.
“It was likely speaking to the so-called peaceful, rational, non-violent people who were unsatisfied with the government’s response before,” he said.
One woman, Pearl, 69, said the protests were no longer about the bill.
“Some of those guys may change their minds, maybe, but just a minority,” she said of the protesters. “Some of them just want to create trouble and they will continue to do so.”
“Too little, too late,” said Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014 pro-democracy protests which were the precursor to the current unrest, on his Facebook page.
Leung Yiu-ting, president of the Hong Kong Education University student union, said the timing was wrong.
“Until the five demands are met, I don’t think the protests and the social movement will stop,” he said.
The protesters’ other four demands are: the retraction of the word “riot” to describe rallies, the release of all arrested demonstrators, an independent inquiry into the police perceived brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to democratically choose their own leaders.
The chief executive’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill’s withdrawal.
Hong Kong‘s benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped after the report of the bill’s imminent withdrawal, trading up about 4%. The property index also jumped.
Lam had said before that the bill was “dead”, but she did not withdraw it.
CHINA’S WARNINGS
Hong Kong returned to China under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system, hence the anger at the extradition bill and perceived creeping influence by Beijing.
China denies it is meddling in Hong Kong‘s affairs but warned again on Tuesday that it would not sit idly by if the unrest threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.
China has regularly denounced the protests and warned about the impact on Hong Kong‘s economy.
Cathay Pacific Airways has been one of the biggest corporate casualties.
China’s aviation regulator demanded it suspend staff from flying over its airspace if they were involved in, or supported, the demonstrations. The airline has laid off at least 20 including pilots and cabin crew.
The airline on Wednesday announced the resignation of chairman John Slosar, following the departure of CEO Rupert Hogg last month.
The unrest has shown no sign of easing.
Riot police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray – both anti-riot weapons – to clear demonstrators from outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station, with one man taken out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, television footage showed.
The police, who have repeatedly denied using excessive force, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HONG KONG: Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw global attention to their fight for greater democracy for the Chinese-ruled city which is facing its biggest political crisis in decades.
Planes were taking off and landing, with delays, but trains were suspended and approach roads to the airport impassable as protesters erected barricades and overturned trolleys at the airport and in the nearby new town of Tung Chung.
Some passengers were forced to walk the last bit of their journey to the airport by foot, dragging their luggage behind them.
The MTR subway station in Tung Chung was closed and demonstrators smashed CCTV cameras and lamps with metal poles and dismantled station turnstiles. Police appeared to be running in all directions and made several arrests.
Chek Lap Kok, built around a tiny outlying island in the dying days of British colonial rule, is one of the world’s busiest and most efficient airports, reached by a series of bridges which were packed with traffic.
“If we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong,” said one 20-year-old protester, asking not to be named.
Black-clad demonstrators targeted the airport three weeks ago, jamming the terminal in sometimes violent clashes with police and prompting some flights to be cancelled or delayed.
Police said protesters hurled iron poles, bricks and rocks on to the railway track near the airport station and trespassed on the track. By early evening protesters in the immediate vicinity of the airport had left, but protesters in Tung Chung remained.
“We have no idea how to leave. We’re stuck,” a masked protester said, as others looked for buses and ferries to get back home.
Sunday’s demonstration comes after police and protesters clashed overnight in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to the territory when it was handed back to China in 1997.
China denies the charge of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.
Tourist numbers have plummeted in recent weeks and international trade fairs cancelled as the territory faces its first recession in a decade.
China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.
Several hundred demonstrators also gathered outside the British consulate in central Hong Kong, waving Union Jack flags and chanting “God save the Queen”.
SUBWAY VIOLENCE
Parts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway on Saturday, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas. Police said they arrested 63 people aged between 13 and 36.
Amnesty International said the metro violence should be investigated.
“Violence directed at police on Saturday is no excuse for officers to go on the rampage elsewhere,” it said.
The latest protests came on the fifth anniversary of China’s decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong.
The unrest began in mid-June, fuelled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.
But the turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy.
The unrest poses the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.
Protesters have called for a general strike on Monday, but it was not immediately clear who would take part.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of efforts to restore calm and that talks with non-violent protesters would provide “a way out” for the Chinese-ruled city.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied peacefully in torrential rain on Sunday in the eleventh week of what have been often violent demonstrations.
“I sincerely hope that this was the beginning of society returning to peace and staying away from violence,” Lam said.
“We will immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue. This dialogue, I hope, will be based on a mutual understanding and respect and find a way out for today’s Hong Kong.”
Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China for trial.
The unrest has been fuelled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place after Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.
Three people were wounded, one critically, in a knife attack by an unknown assailant near a “Lennon Wall” of colourful pro-protest messages in the city’s Tseung Kwan O district in the New Territories overnight, police said. One man was arrested.
The protests have prompted sharp reactions from Beijing, which has accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest in the territory. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighbouring Shenzhen.
Britain’s Foreign Office said it was extremely concerned about reports that a Hong Kong staff member had been detained in mainland China, but there was no immediate suggestion that there was any link to the protests.
Staff member Simon Cheng did not return to work on Aug. 9 after visiting the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen the previous day, Hong Kong news website HK01 reported. China’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment. Hong Kong police did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc also said on Monday they had dismantled a state-backed social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on the Twitter and Facebook actions, but defended the right of Chinese people to make their voices heard.
Further demonstrations are planned in the next few days, including by MTR subway workers on Wednesday, secondary school students on Thursday and accountants on Friday.
The protests are exacting a toll on the city’s economy and tourism, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.
Singapore universities have cancelled exchange programmes to Hong Kong after Singapore warned its citizens to defer travel there, news website Today reported.
Singapore’s foreign ministry said in an advisory last week large protests in Hong Kong had become unpredictable and could turn violent with little or no notice.
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS
Sunday’s protest turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and protesters could be seen on Sunday night urging others to go home peacefully.
Aside from seeking Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
“The bill is dead,” Lam told Tuesday’s news briefing. “There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns.”
Police have been criticised for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
Lam said the police watchdog had set up a task force to investigate complaints.
She said she hoped Hong Kong had “unique advantages in attracting overseas companies”, stressing the rule of law, but warned of the risk of pressure on the economy which shrank 0.4% in April-June from the previous quarter.
“The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half. Actually, I think the data in the first half has not fully reflected the seriousness of the problem,” she said.
China has put strong pressure on big companies in Hong Kong over the protests, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s departure was announced by Chinese state television and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in protests.
China’s State Council called on Monday for greater development of the southern city of Shenzhen and integration of its culture and economy with neighbouring Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong is gearing up for further protests this week after hundreds of thousands of anti-government demonstrators braved heavy rain to rally peacefully on Sunday, marking a change to what have often been violent clashes.
Sunday’s massive turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the Chinese-ruled city’s airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and on Sunday night protesters could be seen urging others to go home peacefully.
Police said on Monday that while Sunday’s demonstration was mostly peaceful, there were breaches of the peace in the evening when some protesters defaced public buildings and aimed laser beams at officers.
It was a far cry from the violent clashes between protesters and riot police throughout the summer, with activists storming the legislature and targeting China’s main Liaison Office in the city. The weekend was also noteworthy for a lack of tear gas use by police.
The protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. They have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China, including an independent judiciary, but many in the city believe Beijing has been eroding those freedoms.
Aside from Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
One protester, speaking at a “citizen’s press conference” on Monday, was asked what path the protests would take now, peaceful or violent.
“We have started our rallies very peacefully but after two and a half months it seems that the Hong Kong government has not responded to our five demands so one thing leads to another and it may cause escalation,” the speaker, named Wang, said.
“If you ask me, I personally hope there will be a quick resolution to this from the government so we don’t have to protest any more.”
On Sunday, protesters spilling out from Victoria Park, the designated rally area on Hong Kong island, streamed onto major thoroughfares towards the city’s financial centre, chanting for Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam to step down.
Police estimated the size of the crowd in Victoria Park at 128,000 at its peak, although that excludes the masses of umbrella-carrying demonstrators who packed the streets.
CHINESE FORCES ACROSS THE BORDER
The Hong Kong government said in a statement on Sunday night it was important to restore social order as soon as possible and that it would begin talks with the public and “rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down”.
The Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, attributed the change in the character of Sunday’s protest to the presence of Chinese paramilitary forces, which have been conducting exercises in Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong.
“This was widely seen as a stern warning to the violent elements in Hong Kong,” it said, adding that a backlash from Hong Kong residents over last week’s airport occupations was another factor.
The Chinese Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper warned again in an editorial on Monday that hostile foreign influences were inciting the protest movement. Beijing has accused some countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest.
US President Donald Trump hinted on Sunday that the White House would like to see Beijing resolve the protests before the world’s two largest economies could reach a trade deal.
“I would like to see Hong Kong worked out in a very humanitarian fashion,” Trump said. “I think it would be very good for the trade deal.”
Further demonstrations are planned in coming weeks, including protests planned by Christians and even an accountants’ group.
Police have come under criticism for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations, but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
The central government has sought to deepen integration between the mainland and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and nearby Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave which returned to China in 1999. The State Council called on Monday for greater development of the so-called Greater Bay Area and to enrich the “one country, two systems” policy.
China has also put strong pressure on big companies, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s sudden departure was announced by Chinese state television on Friday and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in the protests.
Shares in Cathay rose more than 2% early on Monday before paring gains to be down 0.6%. Jeffries analysts wrote in a note on Monday that it maintained its “buy” rating on Cathay and that it expected the company to remain profitable.

KATHMANDU: Nepal must make training and experience in high altitude climbing mandatory for all climbers on Mount Everest and other high peaks, a government panel said on Wednesday, following the deadliest climbing season in four years.
Eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the 8,850 metre (29,035 feet) mountain in May – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side.
The Nepali panel – made up of government officials, climbing experts and agencies representing the climbing community – was set up after climbers and guides criticised officials after the deaths for allowing anyone who paid $11,000 to climb Everest.
Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Everest, and mountain climbing is a key source of employment and income for the cash strapped nation.
But the numbers attempting the climb in May led to crowding in the so-called death zone, where there are very low oxygen levels. That put lives at risk as oxygen cylinders ran out while up to 100 people waited in the queue.
Nepal issued 381 permits for Everest for this year’s climbing season, which tends to culimate in May, when the daylight and weather is the most forgiving.
“Climbers to Sagarmatha and other 8,000 metre mountains must undergo basic and high altitude climbing training,” the panel said in a report submitted to the government, referring to the Nepali name of Mount Everest.
The report said those hoping to climb Everest must climb at least one Nepali peak above 6,500 metres before getting a permit. Climbers must also submit a certificate of good health and physical fitness, and be accompanied by a trained Nepali guide, it said.
Ghanshyam Upadhyaya, a senior Tourism Ministry official, said the recommendations would be implemented.
“The government will now make the required changes in laws and regulations guiding mountain climbing,” he told Reuters.
Mira Acharya, a member of the panel said “climbers died due to altitude sickness, heart attack, exhaustion or weaknesses and not due to traffic jams”.
She said the compulsory provision of guides for each climber was to discourage solo attempts which put lives at risk.
A reliable weather forecasting system should be in place and rope fixing should be done in time, giving enough space for the climbers to use a window of good weather to reach the summit, the report said.

HONG KONG: Flights leaving Hong Kong were disrupted for a second day on Tuesday, plunging the former British colony deeper into turmoil as its stockmarket fell to a seven-month low, and its leader said it had been pushed into a state of “panic and chaos”.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also urged Hong Kong to exercise restraint and investigate evidence of its forces firing tear gas at protesters in ways banned under international law.
Ten weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and protesters have roiled the Asian financial hub as thousands of residents chafe at a perceived erosion of freedoms and autonomy under Chinese rule.
China this week condemned some protesters for using dangerous tools to attack police, calling the clashes “sprouts of terrorism”. They present President Xi Jinping with one of his biggest challenges since he came to power in 2012.
Hong Kong legal experts say Beijing might be paving the way to use anti-terror laws to try to quell the demonstrations.
Check-in operations were suspended at 4.30 pm on Tuesday, a day after an unprecedented airport shutdown, as thousands of black-clad protesters jammed the terminal, chanting, singing and waving banners.
“Take a minute to look at our city, our home,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said, her voice cracking, at a news conference in the government headquarters complex, which is fortified behind 6-foot (1.8-m) -high water-filled barricades.
“Can we bear to push it into the abyss and see it smashed to pieces?”
The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed suspects’ extradition to mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy.
At the airport, thousands of protesters gathered in the arrivals hall, as well as some parts of departures, using luggage trolleys to blockade the doors to customs checkpoints.
Floors and walls were covered with missives penned by activists and other artwork. The scene was peaceful as knots of protesters spoke to travellers, explaining their aims.
“Sorry for the inconvenience, we are fighting for the future of our home,” read one protest banner at the airport.
“I think paralysing the airport will be effective in forcing Carrie Lam to respond to us … it can further pressure Hong Kong’s economy,” said Dorothy Cheng, 17.
Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997.
They want Lam to resign. She says she will stay.
“My responsibility goes beyond this particular range of protest,” she said, adding that violence had pushed the territory into a state of “panic and chaos”.
As she spoke, the benchmark Hang Seng index hit a seven-month low. It shed more than 2%, dragging down markets across Asia.
Lam did not respond to questions at a press briefing to clarify if she had the power to withdraw the extradition bill and satisfy a key demand made by the protesters, or if she needed Beijing’s approval.
AIRPORT DISRUPTED
Airport authorities had earlier suspended check-in operations as the fifth day of a sit-in by protesters grew increasingly heated. Crowds continued to swell in the evening.
“Terminal operations at Hong Kong International Airport have been seriously disrupted as a result of the public assembly,” the airport authority said.
Some passengers challenged protesters over the delays as tempers began to fray, while the demonstrators, using a Chinese term of encouragement, chanted, “Hong Kong people – add oil!”
Flag carrier Cathay Pacific warned: “There is potential for further flight disruptions at short notice.”
The airline, whose British heritage makes it a symbol of Hong Kong’s colonial past, is also in a political bind.
China’s civil aviation regulator demanded that the airline suspend staff who joined or backed the protests from flights in its airspace, pushing the carrier’s shares past Monday’s 10-year low.
Other Chinese airlines have offered passengers wanting to avoid Hong Kong a free switch to nearby destinations, such as Guangzhou, Macau, Shenzhen or Zhuhai, with the disruption sending shares in Shenzhen Airport Co Ltd surging.
On Monday China said the protests had reached a critical juncture, after a weekend of street clashes in which both police and protesters appeared to toughen their resolve.
Police fired tear gas at the blackshirted crowds in districts on Hong Kong island, Kowloon and the New Territories.

HONG KONG/BEIJING: China’s aviation regulator on Friday demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend personnel who have engaged in illegal protests in the city from staffing flights into its airspace from August 10.
Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Last week, a Cathay pilot was among over 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.
On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said that Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website.
The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights.
Crew members that have not gained the authority’s approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations.
The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.
In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: “We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly.”
“The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific. There is zero tolerance for any inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour that may affect aviation safety. We deal with these incidents very seriously.”
Cathay said on Thursday it respects “everyone’s right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner,” while insisting it “recognises that Hong Kong SAR is a part of China”.
“We do not condone any activities that jeopardise the stability of Hong Kong,” it said.
On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights.
Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respects its staff’s opinions.
“We certainly wouldn’t dream of telling them what they have to think about something. They’re all adults, they’re all service professionals. We respect them greatly,” he said.
Global Times, published by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, ran news stories this week highlighting Cathay employees’ participation in the ongoing protests.
Embattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam on Friday urged an end to the violence, claiming that the protests are dragging on the city’s economy.
Hong Kong-listed Cathay is 45% owned by Swire Pacific and 22.7% held by Air China , according to Refinitiv Eikon.
The airline has been Hong Kong’s flag carrier since the colonial era. Swire Pacific’s parent, John Swire & Sons Ltd, is a UK-based conglomerate with businesses ranging from property to transportation.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Wednesday it would expel India’s ambassador and suspend bilateral trade with its arch-rival after New Delhi stripped its portion of the contested Kashmir region of special status.
Neighbours China and Pakistan, which both claim parts of the region, have voiced fierce opposition to India’s move dropping a constitutional provision that had allowed the country’s only Muslim-majority state to make its own laws.
Moin-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s newly-appointed ambassador to India, had yet to take up his post but will now not move to New Delhi, while Indian Ambassador Ajay Bisaria will be expelled, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a telephone interview with Pakistani TV channel ARY News.
“It is very obvious that our ambassador wouldn’t be in Delhi, and obviously the man who is here will also leave,” Qureshi said.
Earlier Pakistan’s National Security Committee, a panel of top government and military officials chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, said it would implement a range of measures over what it called India’s “illegal” decision to revoke Kashmir’s special status.
That includes “downgrading of diplomatic relations with India” and a further review of bilateral arrangements between the two countries, a committee statement said, without elaborating further.
Qureshi told Pakistan’s parliament on Wednesday the country was consulting with China regarding Kashmir and that he might fly to Beijing for discussions with officials there.
A spokesman for India’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ISLAMABAD/MUZAFFARABAD: Pakistan said on Tuesday it was considering further diplomatic and military pressure on India after the Hindu-majority nation stripped its portion of contested Kashmir of special status.
India on Monday dropped a constitutional provision for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which has long been a flashpoint in ties with neighbouring Pakistan, to make its own laws.
Nuclear arch-rivals India and Pakistan both claim Muslim-majority Kashmir in full but rule it in part. They have fought two wars over the territory and came close to a third this year after a car bomb set off by a Pakistan-based militant group killed dozens of Indian paramilitary police.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday India’s removal of special status for Kashmir, which included prohibiting outsiders from owning property, was an attempt to alter the demographics of the region and was illegal under international law.
“We will fight it at every forum. We’re thinking how we can take it to International Court (of Justice)… to the United Nations Security Council,” Khan said in an address to Pakistan’s parliament.
Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, accusing India of violating Security Council resolutions on Kashmir.
Qureshi is returning early from the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as a result of the crisis, the foreign ministry said.
India maintains its actions in Kashmir are legal both under domestic and international law.
Earlier on Tuesday, Pakistan’s army chief said the country’s military will “go to any extent” to support people in the region.
“Pakistan Army firmly stands by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end,” said General Qamar Javed Bajwa after meeting with top commanders in Rawalpindi.
“We are prepared and shall go to any extent to fulfil our obligations in this regard,” he added, without elaborating further.
BUSINESS SHUTDOWN
In Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir around 45km (28 miles) from the contested border between the neighbours, protests continued for a second day with hundreds of people including children shouting anti-India slogans.
In the Neelum Valley, which sits on the border and has seen heavy shelling between the two countries in recent weeks, there was a shutdown of shops and businesses in protest at India’s decision.
Many people in Kashmir have relatives on both sides of the border, but people on the Pakistani side say they have been unable to contact those in India for several days after New Delhi restricted internet and phone access.
Tanveer-ul-Islam migrated from India to Muzaffarabad in 1990. His family, including his elderly mother and siblings, live in the Badgam district of Indian Kashmir, but he said he has been unable to contact them for two days.
“My day does not begin until I speak to my mother, but I have not been able to talk to her (since) Aug 4. You can’t even imagine my pain,” he said. “We do not know about the well being of anyone across the divide”.
His wife Haleema Akhtar, whose family is in Magam in Indian-administered Kashmir, said she was also unable to contact them.
“I called my daughter and son-in-law in the US to try to contact them, but they too expressed helplessness in the face of the clampdown on communication,” she said.

HONG KONG: Police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong on Sunday after violent clashes a day earlier, and Beijing said it would not let the situation persist.
The Chinese-controlled city has been rocked by months of protests against a proposed bill to allow people to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China and they have now grown into calls for greater democracy.
A general strike aimed at bringing the city, an Asian financial hub, to a halt is planned for Monday.
After the peaceful demonstrations finished, hundreds of masked protesters blocked roads in the town of Tseung Kwan O in the New Territories, set up barricades and hurled hard objects, including bricks at a police station.
Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters after a separate rally in the island’s Western district where thousands of people gathered to urge authorities to listen to public demands.
Protesters had began a march towards China’s Liaison Office which has been a flashpoint at previous protests.
Police said the protesters were “participating in an unathorised assembly”, similar to Saturday when they fired multiple tear gas rounds in confrontations with black-clad activists in the Kowloon area.
Police said they had arrested more than 20 people for offences overnight including unlawful assembly and assault. The protests have become the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule 22 years ago after being governed by Britain since 1842. China’s official news agency Xinhua said on Sunday: “Central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue. We firmly believe that Hong Kong will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges ahead.”
During the day protesters had marched brandishing coloured leaflets, called for a mass strike across Hong Kong on Monday and shouted “Restore Hong Kong” and “Revolution of our time.”
“We’re trying to tell the government to (withdraw) the extradition bill and to police to stop the investigations and the violence,” said Gabriel Lee, a 21-year-old technology student.
Lee said what made him most angry was that the government was not responding to any of the protesters’ demands or examining the police violence.
What started as an angry response to the now suspended extradition bill, has expanded to demands for greater democracy and the resignation of leader Carrie Lam.
“Even if Carrie Lam resigns, its still not resolved. It’s all about the Communist Party, the Chinese government,” said Angie, a 24-year-old working for a non-government organisation.
Protesters on Saturday set fires in the streets, outside a police station and in rubbish bins, and blocked the entrance to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon peninsula.
Shops in the tourist and commercial area Nathan Road, normally packed on a Saturday, were shuttered including 7-11 convenience stores, jewellery chain Chow Tai Fook and watch brands Rolex and Tudor.
Thousands of civil servants joined in the anti-government protests on Friday for the first time since they started in June, defying a warning from authorities to remain politically neutral.
PROTEST TACTICS
The protests have adapted rapidly since the start of June with the movement spreading from the Admiralty area, where the legislative council is located, across to the whole city for the first time.
Previous protests have also targeted mainland visitors to try and make them understand the situation in what is officially termed a Special Administrative Region of China.
Young people have mostly been at the forefront of the protests, infuriated with broader problems including sky-high living costs and what they see as an unfair housing policy skewed towards the rich.
However, the demonstrations have seen people of all ages, including families and the elderly take part.
The protests mark the biggest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took office in 2012.
Hong Kong has been allowed to retain extensive freedoms, such as an independent judiciary but many residents see the extradition bill as the latest step in a relentless march toward mainland control.
Months of demonstrations are taking a growing toll on the city’s economy, as local shoppers and tourists avoid parts of one of the world’s most famous shopping destinations.
Matthew Wang, a 22-year-old marketing executive for a multinational corporation, said that the government was “encouraging people to become more radical to affect decision making because they are not addressing any of the demands.”

183,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/us-believes-osama-bin-ladens-son-hamza-is-dead-official/,"NEW YORK: The United States believes that Hamza bin Laden, a son of slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and himself a notable figure in the militant group, is dead, a US official said on Wednesday.
The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, provided no further details, including when Hamza died or where.
President Donald Trump earlier on Wednesday declined to comment after NBC News first reported the US assessment. Asked if he had intelligence that bin Laden’s son had been killed, Trump told reporters: “I don’t want to comment on it.”
Separately, the White House declined comment on whether any announcement was imminent.
Hamza, believed to be about 30 years old, was at his father’s side in Afghanistan before the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and spent time with him in Pakistan after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan pushed much of al Qaeda’s senior leadership there, according to the Brookings Institution.
Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces who raided his compound in Pakistan in 2011. Hamza was thought to be under house arrest in Iran at the time, and documents recovered from the compound indicated that aides had been trying to reunite him with his father.
The New York Times reported that the United States had a role in the operation that led to Hamza’s death, which it said took place in the past two years. Reuters could not immediately verify those details.
Still, the US government’s conclusion appears to be a recent one. In February, the State Department said it was offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading “to the identification or location in any country” of Hamza, calling him a key al Qaeda leader.
Introduced by al Qaeda’s chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio message in 2015, Hamza provided a younger voice for the group whose ageing leaders have struggled to inspire militants around the world galvanized by Islamic State, according to analysts.
Hamza has called for acts of terrorism in Western capitals and threatened to take revenge against the United States for his father’s killing, the US State Department said in 2017 when it designated him as a global terrorist.
He also threatened to target Americans abroad and urged tribal groups in Saudi Arabia to unite with Yemen’s al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to fight against Saudi Arabia, it said.
In March, Saudi Arabia announced it had stripped Hamza bin Laden of his citizenship, saying the decision was made by a royal order in November 2018.

KUALA LUMPUR: An undocumented domestic worker has the right to pursue her claim for unpaid wages in Malaysia, a court has ruled, setting a legal precedent migrant rights groups said would help protect human trafficking survivors.
In a landmark ruling this week, a high court in Malaysia said an Indonesian domestic worker who was not paid for nearly five years can pursue her case after it was dismissed earlier by labour authorities because she did not have a work permit.
“This is a precedent for all undocumented workers,” Glorene Das, executive director at the Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Tuesday.
“With this precedent, there is hope for undocumented workers to seek redress in court. They are workers who have been exploited in trafficked and forced labour situations,” she said by phone.
Malaysia relies heavily on foreign workers in areas such as manufacturing, domestic work and on plantations, hosting millions of migrant labourers from countries such as Indonesia, Nepal and Bangladesh.
But many of them are victims of human trafficking who were duped by brokers with promises of lucrative pay, often arriving without a valid work permit, and then suffer abuses later.
The Indonesian woman, who is in her 20s and whose name was withheld by Tenaganita for privacy reasons, fled to the group’s shelter in 2017. Tenaganita helped her file the legal case over unpaid wages.
She sought about 30,000 Malaysian ringgit ($7,300) in unpaid wages at the government’s labour department and then a labour court, but both rejected her case.
She lodged an appeal with a high court last year, which ruled on Monday that it was “premature” for the claim to be thrown out based on the work permit status, according to Tenaganita and the Malaysiakini news website.
The court also ordered the case to be fully heard.
“All I want is my wages that I have worked for, so that I can go home to my family,” the Indonesian woman said in a statement provided by Tenaganita.
The high court and the labour department could not be reached on Tuesday due to a public holiday.
Indonesia and Cambodia, key sources of migrant workers to Malaysia, have in the past temporarily banned their citizens from going to work in Malaysia as maids after cases of abuse.
Malaysia has said this year that it was ready to “declare war” on human trafficking and forced labour, with a review of labour laws was underway.
The U.S. State Department’s 2019 Trafficking in Persons report put Malaysia in its Tier 2 Watch List – the second-lowest ranking – for not meeting the minimum standards in efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

LONDON: Travelers faced a second day of travel disruptions in Britain on Friday after a heat wave gave way to thunderstorms, and technical problems at the air traffic control center grounded many flights at the country’s two main airports on one of the busiest days of the year.
A day after the country potentially recorded its hottest day ever, travelers at London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports faced delays after the UK’s air traffic controller, NATS, said it had identified a technical problem that was causing flight restrictions.
It was not clear if the matter was related to the hot weather or the ensuing thunderstorms.
“We are doing all we can to fix it as soon as possible,” NATS said in a statement.
Eurocontrol, the European air traffic body, said the technical problem is being caused by an “issue with radar displays” and hefty delays are expected for flights arriving at Heathrow and Gatwick for the rest of Friday.
This weekend is a big travel moment as families head off for their summer holidays now that schools have broken up for the academic year.
Britain, along with much of Western Europe, endured one of its hottest days ever on Thursday, potentially its hottest. The country’s weather service said a provisional temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.7 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded at Cambridge University Botanic Garden in eastern England, which if confirmed would be the highest ever recorded in the UK.
The existing record for the UK is 38.5 Celsius (101.3 Fahrenheit), was set in August 2003.
It said “quality control and analysis over the next few days” will determine whether the reading becomes official.
Rail commuters were also facing delays after the heat wave prompted Network Rail to impose speed restrictions in case the tracks buckled. Engineers from the company have been working to get the network back to normal after the track temperatures soared to up to 20 C (68 F) more than the air temperature.
“With the railway being made of metal and moving parts, the sustained high temperatures took their toll in places,” said Phil James of Network Rail. “Everything was done to keep trains moving where possible, and last night hundreds of staff were out fixing the damage and repairing the railway ready for today.”
Passengers using Eurostar services to and from Paris were also facing “severe disruption” due to overhead power line problems in the French capital, which on Thursday recorded its hottest day ever with the temperature rising to 42.6 C (108.7 F).
Authorities across Europe were looking to address the consequences of Thursday’s soaring temperatures, as records that had stood — in some cases for decades — fell.
Europeans and tourists alike jumped into fountains, lakes, rivers or the sea to escape a suffocating heat wave rising up from the Sahara. Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands — all places where air conditioning is not typically installed in homes, cafes or stores — strained under the heat.
In France, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner linked the country’s 60 drowning deaths so far this month indirectly to the current heat wave, warning that drownings are up 30% this month compared to last July.
Castaner noted a rise in people drowning in unguarded bodies of water as they seek relief from high temperatures, some of whom suffer thermal shock when they jump from hot air into cold water.
In Belgium, a 66-year-old woman died near her caravan close to the beach.
The woman was found by a neighbor late Thursday afternoon after she had apparently been basking in the blazing sun. The incident happened in Middelkerke on the Belgian coast as temperatures rose in the region to over 40 degrees Celsius. (104 Fahrenheit)
Middelkerke police commissioner Frank Delva told The Associated Press that the death is “very clearly linked to the heat.”
Emergency services rushed to the scene but could not resuscitate the woman.

Comic has gone viral, translated into 10 languages
Artist says the issue needs to be better known
China says no mistreatment of Uighurs

TOKYO: A Japanese artist whose manga comics about a Uighur woman went viral wants to use the simple power of her work to raise awareness of the “daily suffering” endured by the Chinese mostly Muslim minority, she told Reuters.
With “What Has Happened to Me”, a manga comic that has been translated into 10 languages – including Mandarin, Uighur and English – and viewed more than 330,000 times online, artist Tomomi Shimizu has seized on an issue that many Western countries see as evidence of Beijing’s abuse of human rights.

In panels of spare, black-and-white drawings, Shimizu tells the story of Mihrigul Tursun, a real Uighur woman who now lives in the United States and says she was beaten and detained in China for being a Uighur.
“The Uighur issue has been well known among people who are into politics. But little is known among the general public. The gap is staggering,” Shimizu, 50, told Reuters in an interview.
“I decided to use manga for this purpose because I believe manga has power to convey things to people in an easy-to-understand way.”
Shimizu, who has penned another comic about Uighurs, appears to be no stranger to politics, having voiced support on her Twitter account for issues generally backed by Japan’s right wing.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, most of them ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions in the Xinjiang region of northwest China, as part of what Beijing calls an antiterrorism campaign.
China has said Xinjiang faces a threat from Islamist militants and separatists.
Beijing rejects accusations of mistreatment and denies mass internment, saying it is simply seeking to end extremism and violence in Xinjiang through education, and that it is offering Uighurs better employment prospects with vocational training.
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Chinese government has accused Tursun of spreading lies about her time in Xinjiang and strongly denied her accusations of mistreatment.
COMFORT WOMEN, ‘HARDSHIP’
Shimizu has at times voiced opposition to China but says she is not trying to use the Uighur issue to smear China.
She has tweeted that China wants to see Japan’s southern island of Okinawa become independent.
In 2015, she raised doubts about the grounds for criticism that China and South Korea level at Japan, describing former “comfort women” – a Japanese euphemism for the women, many of them Korean, who were forced to work in Japan’s wartime military brothels – as “lying”.
Shimizu told Reuters that while she felt truly sorry for those women who had been taken against their will, she found dubious some of the accounts told by former comfort women.
Shimizu based her manga story on what she learned from watching video-recorded testimony from Tursun.
In the comic, Tursun is detained by Chinese authorities despite having committed no crime. She is separated from her 45-day-old triplets and is tortured with electric rods.
She is paroled only to find out that one of her triplets died in government custody. Later, she is incarcerated again, in a room so crowded that detainees have to take turns to lie down.
After a third detention, she asks why she has to face so much hardship. An official says: “It is because you are Uighur”.
“There are people who need help now, people who are going through hardship every day,” Shimizu said.
She uploaded “What Has Happened to Me” on her Twitter account on Aug 31. Soon, messages started pouring in “like a waterfall”, and it was retweeted 8,000 times in a few hours.
“It is without doubt that Ms Shimizu’s manga has played an invaluable role in letting the world know the Uighur issue,” Japan Uyghur Association Chairman Ilham Mahmut said.
Lee Da-Ren, a Taiwanese living in Japan, volunteered to translate Shimizu’s work into Mandarin.
“By taking the form of manga, the story is so easy to read, and yet so penetrating,” Lee said.

Warragamba Dam services 80% of Sydney‘s 5 million residents
Temperatures in NSW set to spike next week
Govt minister says looking into support for volunteers
Fires travel immense distances in Australia

SYDNEY: Australian authorities said on Friday they are focused on protecting water plants, pumping stations, pipes and other infrastructure from intense bushfires surrounding Sydney, the country’s largest city.
Firefighters battling the blazes for weeks received a reprieve of slightly cooler, damper conditions over Christmas, but the respite is not expected to last long.
Temperatures in New South Wales (NSW) state are forecast to head back towards 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) early next week, fuelling fires near Warragamba Dam, which provides water to about 80% of Sydney‘s 5 million residents.
“In recent days up to the cool change, the fires had been a potential threat to supply and assets, particularly in Warragamba and in the Blue Mountains,” a spokesman for the state’s water authority, WaterNSW, told Reuters.
“With the coming very hot conditions the fire situation may escalate in both those fronts and possibly elsewhere.”
Warragamba Dam is located 65km (40 miles) west of Sydney, catching water flowing from the mountains.
It is at 44.8% capacity, down from almost being full less than three years ago, as a prolonged drought ravages the continent’s east.
Despite the widespread destruction, the state’s water infrastructure network has not been damaged, the spokesman said.
There have been eight deaths, including two volunteer firefighters, linked to the blazes since they flared in spring.
With more than 40 dams across the state, WaterNSW supplies two-thirds of untreated water to the state’s water utilities, which then treat and clean the resource to provide drinking water to cities and regional towns.
Large quantities of ash and burnt material could pose a threat to the quality of water in the dams if the fires are followed by heavy rain.
However, there is no significant rain forecast for NSW in the short-term and WaterNSW has put containment barriers to catch potential debris run-off, the water authority said.
VOLUNTEER FORCE
Australia’s reliance on a large volunteer firefighting force has been tested during this fire season that still potentially has months to run through the southern hemisphere summer.
While conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison previously said compensation for volunteers was not a priority, he said on Tuesday that government workers could receive additional paid leave for volunteering.
A senior government minister said on Friday the government was now looking into providing wider relief.
“The prime minister is looking at this issue further on how we can provide targeted support in these extreme circumstances so that our volunteers get the support they need to keep volunteering,” Defence Minister Linda Reynolds told media in Perth.
While there are different rules across Australia’s states, volunteers tend to negotiate time off directly with their employer.
Morrison has been under intense political pressure after it was revealed he was holidaying in Hawaii shortly before Christmas while the country grappled with an emergency and two volunteers near the fire frontlines had been killed.
Fires are travelling immense distances through bushland before hitting towns and containment lines where volunteer firefighters concentrate their resources.
The bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares (9.9 million acres) across the country, dwarfing the terrain burnt by fierce fires in California during 2019.

188,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/california-jails-use-kinder-approach-to-solitary-confinement/,"SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA: An inmate in solitary confinement at a California jail was refusing to leave his cell. The jailers’ usual response: Send an “extraction team” of corrections officers to burst into the cell and drag him out.
But not in Contra Costa County, one of three in the state using a kinder, gentler approach in response to inmate lawsuits, a policy change that experts say could be a national model for reducing the use of isolation cells.
So the inmate was asked: “What if we gave you a couple extra cookies and another sandwich? Would you move?” recalled Don Specter, the nonprofit Prison Law Office director who negotiated the new policies. “He said yes. … They were like, ‘Wow.'”
More than a quarter of US states and numerous smaller jurisdictions are looking for ways to reduce the use of solitary confinement, according to the Vera Institute of Justice, which encourages alternatives to a practice behavioral experts say is dehumanizing and can worsen mental illness.
The new policies in California came after Specter’s firm sued seven of California’s 58 counties, alleging that conditions had grown inhumane as jails absorbed inmates who previously would have served their sentences in state prisons. The state in 2011 began sending less serious offenders to local jails for years at a time to ease crowding in state penitentiaries.
Some jurisdictions nationwide are banning isolation for young offenders, pregnant women or those with mental health diagnoses. The California counties’ approach of generally limiting it to those who engage in continued violent behavior has dramatically reduced the number of inmates in isolation and the length of time they stay there.
Contra Costa started 2019 with about 100 people in solitary, most for more than a year. It had just three in isolation cells by December, after officials began using the new approach.
Sacramento County also is following the policy pioneered by Santa Clara County, while Fresno County is considering it. Among other things, it encourages the use of low-cost incentives to reward good behavior, like the opportunity to listen to the radio, watch a movie or get an extra snack.
Sacramento County has cut its isolated population roughly in half, to about 60 inmates, said Lt Alex McCamy: “It’s a limited time frame and a limited group, but the initial impression is positive.”
Rick Raemisch, who restricted the use of solitary confinement when he headed Colorado’s prison system, said the violent, tense, dirty conditions in Santa Clara County’s jail improved markedly with the new policy.
“Think of yourself being in a cell the size of a parking space for 23 hours a day,” said Raemisch, who consulted with county officials. “At a minimum you’re going to get angry, and when you get angry you’re going to fight back.”
Inmates nationwide are most often segregated for nonviolent “nuisance infractions” like smoking, cursing, disobeying orders or having unauthorized items from the commissary, said the Vera Institute’s Sara Sullivan.
Santa Clara County once locked a woman in solitary confinement for 2 1/2 years for talking back to correctional officers or yelling and banging on her cell door with other detainees, according to Specter’s lawsuit.
The California counties’ new policy of restricting its use to continued violent behavior could be seen as a national pilot program, Sullivan said.
New Jersey’s Middlesex County Adult Correction Center has lowered the number of isolated inmates and the time they spend there, she said, but with a different approach that lets inmates out of their cells more frequently.
The Hampden County Correctional Center in Massachusetts increased its use of alternative sanctions and positive reinforcement. And Cook County, Illinois, no longer keeps troublesome inmates in isolation, allowing them to regularly spend time with about a half-dozen other inmates.
“There’s been a decades-long effort to reform solitary, especially in prisons. But what we haven’t seen is a paired reform effort for jails,” said Amy Fettig, director of the American Civil Liberty Union’s Stop Solitary campaign. “In Santa Clara what we’re seeing is an attempt to reform the whole process.”
Long-term isolation can be so debilitating, Fettig said, that she’s had clients cut themselves “just to feel something because they’ve become numb.”
Santa Clara County, home to San Jose and Silicon Valley, once had 400 inmates in solitary confinement. Specter’s client in Santa Clara County had been in solitary confinement for nearly five years.
By last fall there were about 40 inmates confined to isolation cells for an average of about two months, and just 26 by December.
Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said she and many deputies were initially skeptical.
“It has surprised me, and I think it’s very, very good for our inmates,” she said. “I think what we’re doing is correct, and I think it’s working.”
Smith said she remains concerned that assaults on staff are up. She said the increase is logical, however, since inmates locked in their cells virtually around the clock have little opportunity to assault anyone.
Sgt. Todd Kendrick, president of the county’s correctional officers association, attributed the increase to other less restrictive jail policies as well as the easing of solitary confinement. He and Smith both called for increased staffing.
Smith said the county fell into a pattern of protectively isolating inmates to separate purported gang members and those charged with murder and to safeguard jailhouse informants or sex offenders for fear they would be harmed. Officials sought to improve after several major incidents, including deaths in custody.
Like most jails, three-quarters or more of inmates had not been convicted of a crime and yet spent months and sometimes years awaiting trial in isolation. Under the new policy, “it’s really our philosophy to use that when it’s absolutely necessary, when there’s extraordinary risk,” Smith said.
Jail employees work to get inmates out of segregation as quickly as possible, often using a system in which inmates agree, in writing, not to assault each other.
One inmate refused for 1½ years to leave solitary because he had testified against other gang members, recalled Capt. Thomas Duran, who coordinates the program.
But he saw other longtime inmates leaving segregation and eventually agreed to try it. Rather than put him immediately in with other inmates, deputies paired him with a single inmate — then two other inmates, then four and so on.
He spent more and more time out of his solitary cell until he was fully back into the general jail population.
“We’re trying to set the inmates up not to fail,” Duran said.

189,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/rhino-poaching-at-record-levels-in-botswana/,"GABORONE: Rhino poaching in Botswana’s Okavango Delta has risen at an unprecedented rate with 23 white rhinoceros and eight black rhinoceros killed since October 2018, the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism said.
“Between April and October 2019, nine rhinos were killed. The unfortunate incidents have increased with 13 more rhinos having been poached from October to date,” the ministry said in a statement seen by Reuters late on Monday.
Despite heavy rhino poaching in neighbouring South Africa, which has one of the world’s largest rhino populations, only six rhinos were killed for their horns in Botswana between 2007 and 2017 conversation organisation Save the Rhino said on its website.
The actual size of the Botswana rhino population is kept a secret by government officials but the Department of Wildlife and National Parks Rhino Coordinator, Dr Mmadi Reuben said in October that if the poaching ‘continued at this rate there will be no rhinos in Botswana in a year or two, especially the black rhino, a critically endangered species’.
Botswana is believed to have benefited in 2015 when South Africa moved around 100 rhinos to neighbouring countries as part of efforts to stem the illicit slaughter of the animals for their horns.
Widely regarded as a safe haven for wildlife, Botswana has a strict anti-poaching policy and says it has committed immense resources to combat poaching but poachers have taken advantage of the large size of the Okavango Delta and its difficult wetland terrain.
Botswana said it has stepped up efforts to address poaching with interventions leading to the recovery of some horns and hunting weapons.
A rhino horn is estimated by conservationists to be worth more than $65,000 a kg with demand rising, particularly in Asia, where a newly affluent class regards it as a status symbol and is used as medicine.

Merck & Co said on Friday it expects to make licensed doses of its recently approved Ebola vaccine available in the third quarter of 2020 and price the single-dose injection at the lowest possible access price for poor and middle-income countries.
The vaccine, Ervebo, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, a month after Europe gave its nod to the vaccine, a move that has been hailed by the World Health Organization.

“We have made a commitment to making the vaccine available to GAVI-eligible countries at the lowest possible access price,” Merck spokesman Skip Irvine said. “We have made that commitment but we have not yet established the price for the vaccine.”
Stockpile of 500,00 doses of Ebola vaccine is being established for emergency use in outbreaks of the deadly fever by the GAVI global vaccine alliance, Reuters reported earlier this month. The stockpiling will start with Merck’s Ervebo vaccine.
GAVI, a public-private partnership backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the WHO, the World Bank and UNICEF, arranges bulk buys to reduce vaccine costs for poor countries.
“We are partnering with both GAVI and WHO to put that stockpile in place as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement, adding that the stockpile of vaccines will be governed and executed by the owner of the stockpile and not by Merck.
The Ebola virus causes haemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids. It kills around half of those it infects.
There have been more than 3,000 cases of Ebola, including 2,199 deaths, in the outbreak that was declared in August 2018. The WHO declared it an international emergency in July 2019.
The company said it was working closely with the U.S. government, WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI to prepare against the disease.
Johnson and Johnson’s two-dose vaccine is currently being reviewed by the European regulator. The company is in discussion with the FDA for US approval.
Merck shares rose as much as up 2.8% to record high of $92.55 on Friday.

Six people have now died in bushfires which have destroyed more than 3.7 million hectares (9.1 million acres) across five states.
Potter Steve Harrison, 67, only survived a major blaze southwest of Sydney by crawling beneath a makeshift kiln as the flames passed over.
Harrison stayed to defend his property in the town of Balmoral on Sunday but by the time he changed his mind it was too late to leave.
“I ran to my ute (truck) but my garden was already on fire, the driveway was on fire, the road was on fire so I couldn’t evacuate,” Harrison told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
“The day before I had actually built myself a small kiln down the back — a coffin-sized kiln — just big enough for me to crawl inside,” he said.
“I could have (died) if I hadn’t thought about plan B. In that little kiln enclosure I made, I had a fire extinguisher, a bucket of water, a drinking water bottle and a fire blanket.”
The town of Balmoral, population 400 and 150 houses, was virtually destroyed, the New South Wales (NSW) State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
Australia has been fighting wildfires for months as hot, dry conditions brought about an early start to the fire season.
Australia posted record temperatures over 41 degrees Celsius (105 Celsius) last week as an extreme heatwave swept across the country and a long-running drought in the country’s east has created tinder-dry conditions.
Nearly 100 fires are burning across New South Wales state.
“Conditions have begun to ease,” the New South Wales (state) Rural Fire Service said on Monday.
“Crews will continue their work today to identify and strengthen (fire) containment lines, with favourable conditions over coming days.”
Temperatures are forecast to spike again in many states by the weekend, with the South Australian capital city of Adelaide forecast to reach 39 Celsius (102.2 Fahrenheit), according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Similar temperatures are expected in the Victorian city of Melbourne.
In South Australia one person was confirmed dead in weekend fires and fire fighters were facing another tough day on Monday.
In the Adelaide Hills, a wine growing region where state authorities said 86 homes were destroyed, up to one third of the region’s vineyards were in the “burnout zone,” equivalent to 1,100 hectares of vines, said Jared Stringer, vice president of Adelaide Hills wine region.

Greater Sydney and two other areas rated “catastrophic”
Six fires in NSW burning at emergency level
Person dies in SA fires, 23 firefighters injured
Late wind change expected to lower temperatures this evening

SYDNEY: Catastrophic conditions fueled massive bushfires across Australia’s New South Wales state on Saturday, with two blazes around Sydney burning at emergency level, while in South Australia one person was found dead in a fire zone.
Some major roads heading to the south and west from Sydney were closed for part of the day and authorities asked people to delay travel at the start of the Christmas holiday period, warning of the unpredictability of the fires due to high winds and temperatures above 40C (104F).
A cooling but powerful wind with gusts of up to 90 kmh (56 mph) from the south swept through the state late on Saturday, lowering temperatures significantly but also creating risks that the winds could spread the flames and embers.
“Today has been an awful day,” NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said of the conditions which were rated “catastrophic”, the highest level of danger.
Fitzsimmons said conditions in Sydney may not have reached forecast catastrophic levels, although they did elsewhere. He said the haze from the fires that has choked the city in recent weeks might have helped cap temperatures on Saturday by acting as insulation.
By early evening, six fires in the state were rated at emergency level, including two around Sydney.
“We have seen property impacted and lost. We have 3,000 firefighters and emergency services personnel out there dealing with the fires,” Fitzsimmons told a media conference.
Media reported one person was unaccounted for near Lithgow, a town about 140 km (85 miles) west of Sydney where a number of properties were burned.
Close to 100 fires were burning across NSW, and the RFS said some fires were generating their own thunderstorms. Conditions were expected to improve in coming days, before another burst of hot weather in about a week.
“We will not get on top of these fires until we get some decent rain – we have said that for weeks and months,” Fitzsimmons said.
No significant rainfall was expected in the next couple of months, the Bureau of Meteorology said.
The Gospers Mountain mega fire has already burned almost 460,000 hectares (1.14 million acres) to the northwest of Sydney, and there was a risk it could join up with the Grose Valley fire in the Blue Mountains to the west of Sydney.
The death of the two firefighters on Thursday night, when a tree fell on their truck as they drove through a firefront, brought the death toll from the NSW wildfires to eight since early October.
Shortly after the two deaths were announced, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was rushing back from a family holiday in Hawaii, a trip that had drawn sharp criticism as the crisis deepened. He was expected to arrive later on Saturday.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA FIRES
In South Australia, authorities said one person had been found dead, another was critically injured and 15 homes had been destroyed by a fire in the Adelaide Hills, just 40 kilometres (25 miles) east of the state capital of Adelaide.
The death followed another fatality in South Australia on Friday, the result of a car crash which sparked a fire.
Authorities said fires had burnt through some 40,000 hectares in the state and 23 firefighters suffered injuries on Friday.
In Victoria, authorities said 142 fires had started in the state since Friday, with one burning at an emergency level late on Saturday afternoon.
Australia has been fighting wildfires for weeks, with blazes destroying more than 700 homes and nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland.

194,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/scientists-claim-to-find-ancient-seawall-off-israeli-coast/,"HAHOTRIM BEACH, ISRAEL: An international team of researchers says it has discovered a 7,000-year-old-seawall along Israel’s Mediterranean coast, providing evidence that coastal communities protected themselves against rising waters even in ancient times.
The scientists believe the more than 100-metre-long (110-yard-long) structure acted as a fortification against surging waters and storms. The study, published Wednesday in the Public Library of Science One journal, said the Neolithic era village, called Tel Hreiz, was abandoned and eventually swallowed by the sea.

“Here we have an example, a practical example of a process that is still going on. We can see a whole community which are now under the sea,” said Ehud Galili, lead researcher and archaeologist from Israel’s Haifa University.
The researchers believe the structure was built by villagers out of riverbed boulders found several kilometres (miles) away. The site lies just south of the northern Israeli port city of Haifa.
While seas were rising at a faster rate during the Neolithic period than they are today, the causes were much different, according to co-author Jonathan Benjamin from Flinders University in Australia.
“There’s a big difference between climate change and prehistory which was naturally occurring, and climate change now, which is due to this huge human intervention,” Benjamin said.
Still, similar to contemporary coastal communities, Benjamin said the villagers of Tel Hreiz had to make “the very human decision” to stay or go as the coastline receded.
The ancient settlement was first exposed in the mid-1960s and re-covered by thick sands. After winter storms along the coast in 2012 and 2015 moved these sediments, the structure was uncovered.
Archaeologists have also dug up pottery, animal and human remains that, based on carbon dating, are believed to be from the same settlement.
The community, Galili said, was an “early Mediterranean fishing village” which relied on farming, animal husbandry and exploitation of the land and sea. During the excavations, they also found early examples of olive oil extraction.
At first, researchers considered the possibility that the wall was built for other reasons like agriculture or protection from attackers. But Galili said that during this period, enemies would have come from land and not the sea. He also said there was no sign that the wall extended around the village to defend against land invasions. He concluded the wall “has no other function possible” except to protect against the elements.
Researchers say the seawall itself — found about 120 metres (130 yards) off the coast — is the only structure of its kind found in Israel’s coastal region, making it a “unique example” of the human response to the threat of shrinking coastlines in the Neolithic period.
Roland Gehrels, a physical geographer at Britain’s University of York who specializes in sea-level studies and was not involved in this study, called the discovery a “fascinating find.” He said, however, that the structure was more likely meant to protect against storms than gradually rising sea levels.
“I doubt that humans would have been able to notice this sea-level rise in their lifetime, but they were of course well aware of winter storms and the damage those caused,” he said.
Matteo Vacchi, an expert in coastal changes in the Mediterranean at the University of Pisa who also did not participate in the study, agreed the exact purpose of the seawall is hard to determine. “But what is interesting is that there was this kind of approach of coastal protection even in the Neolithic,” he said.

195,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/murakami-holds-rare-public-reading-to-mark-debut-anniversary/,"TOKYO: A monkey that confesses he steals women’s identity cards, causing them to temporarily forget who they are, starred Tuesday as author Haruki Murakami marked 40 years since his debut as a novelist with his first public reading in Japan in nearly a quarter-century.
Now 70 and one of the world’s most popular and acclaimed novelists, Murakami debuted with “Hear the Wind Sing” in 1979, four years after he began writing while running a jazz bar in Tokyo. His 1987 romantic novel “Norwegian Wood” was his first best-seller, establishing him as a young literary star. His latest novel, “Killing Commendatore,” hit US bookstores last year.

Media-shy Murakami’s last public readings were in Kobe and Ashiya in western Japan, where he grew up, following a deadly 1995 earthquake there. On Tuesday, he was joined by award-winning young female novelist Mieko Kawakami, a longtime Murakami fan who was in the audience at both events 24 years ago before she became a novelist.
After the two authors took turns reading passages from their works, Murakami said, “Actually, I have a brand new novel that I wrote a few weeks ago, and I haven’t even published it.” He said it is called “Confessions of a Shinagawa Monkey” and is a sequel to “A Shinagawa Monkey,” a story of a woman named Mizuki who forgets her name because a monkey had stolen it, published as part of a 2002 compilation, “Five Strange Tales from Tokyo.”
The new story takes place at a small Japanese hot spring hotel where a monkey appears as the protagonist takes a bath. The monkey, apparently speaking in Japanese, offers to wash his back, and explains he was raised by a professor and grew up listening to classical music such as Joseph Bruckner and Richard Strauss. The monkey faced discrimination in the conformist monkey community and ended up at the hot springs hotel where he is hired as a helper and given an attic to live in.
After the protagonist invites the monkey to his room for a chat over beer, the monkey says he is called Shinagawa Monkey and reveals he has a bad habit of stealing part of the names of women he falls in love with by taking their driver’s licenses and other identification cards, causing them to forget their names.
Murakami said ” Confessions of a Shinagawa Monkey” takes about 50 minutes to read, so he read a 30-minute abridged version for the event. Murakami comically acted out conversation between the monkey and the protagonist, setting off laughter from the floor. He said the story may be published in the near future.
Without any video cameras present, Murakami appeared relaxed as he and Kawakami took turns reading their works. Kawakami won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize in 2008 for “Breasts and Eggs” and has penned other award-winning novels including “Dreams of Love, etc,” “Yearning” and “Heaven.”
The two authors have published a new book, “A Horned Owl Takes Off at Dawn: A long long interview by Kawakami Mieko,” a collection of her interviews of Murakami.

CHICAGO: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) on Monday issued its first new autism treatment guidelines in 12 years aimed at helping doctors identify at-risk children and getting them the care they need as early as possible.
Since developmental delays are often present in very young children with autism, the report, published in the journal Pediatrics, urges doctors to check for issues during all well-baby visits and refer children for treatment at the first sign of an issue, rather than wait for a formal autism evaluation.
More than five million Americans are living with autism, a spectrum of disorders marked by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive behaviours of widely varying severity.
“The benefit of identifying children as early as possible is they can then be referred for treatment,” Dr Susan Levy, a developmental and behavioural paediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and co-author of the report, said in a phone interview.
Early treatment and particularly behavioural interventions do make a difference, Levy said.
Since 2007, when AAP published its last two guidance documents, the number of children in the United States diagnosed with autism has risen sharply. Autism now affects 1 in 59 children in the United States, up from 1 in 155 in 2007.
In that time, scientists have developed a better understanding of the potential risk factors and genes that contribute to autism, the related medical and behavioural conditions that commonly occur in children with the condition, and have detailed evidence on which interventions work best.
“This report is really focused on educating paediatricians and other healthcare providers about all the options and issues, and working to empower them since they’re in the front lines to make the early referrals,” Levy said.
The report urges doctors to steer families toward interventions backed by research and away from those with flimsy evidence. It specifically calls out many nutritional interventions that “do not have evidence to support their use.”
It also focuses on the need to screen for and treat other conditions that commonly occur in children with autism.
Some 40% of individuals with autism have intellectual disability, the report said, and about 40% to 60% of school-aged children and adults with autism have anxiety disorders. Others include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), language disorders, sleep and feeding disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms and seizures.
The report encourages doctors to share decision making with families and help them plan for when a child transitions to adolescence and adulthood.

197,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australia-firefighters-accidentally-spread-blaze-ahead-of-heatwave/,"SYDNEY: A backburning operation intended to contain a massive wildfire in eastern Australia sparked out of control, damaging buildings and cutting off major roads, authorities said, as the country heads into another heatwave that may topple temperature records.
The accident occurred about 250 km (155 miles) northwest of Sydney, where firefighters were trying to stop a blaze of some 378,000 hectares (934,000 acres) reaching communities by employing pre-emptive controlled burning.
“We saw a dramatic shift in conditions, a flare-up of fire, some extraordinary behaviour of that fire, and that fire has spread,” New South Wales state Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Monday.
Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the area, Fitzsimmons added, although he did not give an exact figure. There were no new reports of casualties on Monday.
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned nearly 3 million acres of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Bushfires are common in Australia‘s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
Spot fires that would normally be contained on their own have been fanned by wind, coming together into what authorities have called megafires to Sydney’s north, west and south, prompting evacuations and sporadically shrouding the country’s biggest city in smoke.
The Bureau of Meteorology warned of severe to extreme heatwave conditions in the inland parts of the country’s south-east, with temperatures expected to approach or exceed a national average record of 40.3 degrees Celsius (105.4 degrees Fahrenheit).
“We saw significant heat build over Western Australia over the course of last week, and that heat is now pushing east over the continent, which is going to lead to several days of exceptional heat,” bureau climatologist Blair Trewin said in a statement.
“We’re closely monitoring the development and progression of this heat but based on current forecasts we could see that record broken this week.”
The Rural Fire Service’s Fitzsimmons said the heat would exacerbate fire danger, and “despite the very best efforts of everyone, we’re not going to able to contain these fires that we’re expecting later in the week.”

198,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/samoa-extends-measles-state-of-emergency-nz-to-fund-pacific-vaccination-campaign/,"MELBOURNE: The South Pacific island nation of Samoa on Saturday extended a state of emergency due to a measles outbreak which has killed 72 people, mostly infants, as New Zealand announced NZ$1 million ($640,700) to help combat measles in the Pacific.
Samoa said a state of emergency will be extended to December 29 with 5,154 cases of measles now reported since the outbreak started in October. Samoa has a population of only 200,000.
Measles started appearing en masse earlier this year in the New Zealand city of Auckland, a hub for travel to and from small South Pacific islands.
The majority of those who have died in Samoa due to the highly infectious disease have been aged four and under. The island nation had a far lower vaccination rate than its regional neighbours.
Following a mandatory immunization campaign, the Samoan government said approximately 93% of all eligible people in Samoa have now been vaccinated against measles.
“Prevention through vaccination is the most effective way of avoiding illness and a costly health emergency,” New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in a statement announcing the funding.
Under the plan, children under five and new mothers and their families will be targeted for vaccination. The funding would be directed to the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
WHO has described the fact children die from a vaccine-preventable disease as a “collective failure” to protect the world’s most vulnerable children.
The organization said measles infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children.
The picture for 2019 is even worse, it said, with provisional data up to November showing a three-fold increase in case of numbers compared with the same period in 2018.
Measles epidemics have occurred this year in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine.

199,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/edcd-prepares-national-guidelines-for-snakebite-management/,"Kathmandu, December 11
Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under the Department of Health Services has come up with national guideline for snakebite management in Nepal.
According to EDCD an estimated 20,000 people get  bitten by snakes and 10 per cent of them succumb to snakebites, across the country, every year.
Earlier, there was a protocol on snakebite management published by Ministry of Health in 2003.

The national guideline has explained about kinds of snakes found in Nepal, clinical manifestation of common venomous snakes, diagnosis of snakebite, clinical syndrome of snakebite, first aid treatment for patient of snakebite, referral of snakebite patients to health facilities and their role for snakebite management. The guideline explains about condition of referral, management of snakebite when no anti-venom is available and prevention of snakebite.
“The guideline will provide information on venomous snakes found in Nepal and will help in diagnosis of snakebite and its management. The guideline is intended to ensure standardised, timely and effective management of snake bite in the country. This guideline, I hope will be helpful for all health practitioners, army and police personnel, who have been working in preventing and treating snakebite patients, across the country,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.
The government is committed to achieving the national target, which is aligned with World Health Organisation’s target of 50 per cent reduction in deaths and disabilities due to snakebite by 2030.
“The guideline will help health workers to ensure early intervention and efficient use of anti-venom to save lives,” added Dr Lal. The national guideline is expected to avoid misuse of anti-venom, help early recognition of clinical features of snakebite, reaction to anti-venom, and provide appropriate management including artificial ventilation for patients if required.
Snakebite is life threatening medical emergency and survival of snakebite patients depends largely on appropriate first aid measures and immediate transportation to the nearest health centre where facility to administer anti-snake venom and supportive care is available.
The division has planned to train master trainers to help prevent snakebite in all provinces across the country.
“There will be at least three master trainers in all provinces across the country within this fiscal. These trainers will train other health workers in their respected provinces to help save lives from snakebite,” said Dr Lal.

200,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/thunberg-a-bit-surprised-to-be-time-person-of-the-year/,"MADRID: Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg said she was surprised and honoured on Wednesday to be named Time’s youngest Person of the Year, while adding that others in the global movement she helped inspire deserve to share the accolade.
The 16-year-old Swede has become the face of a new generation of environmental activists, drawing large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences over the past year and a half. Some have welcomed her work, including her speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming. But others have criticized her sometimes combative tone.
“For sounding the alarm about humanity’s predatory relationship with the only home we have, for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders, for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads, Greta Thunberg is Time’s 2019 Person of the Year,” the media franchise said on its website.

As she left a UN climate conference in Madrid, Thunberg told The Associated Press that she was “a bit surprised” at the recognition.
“I could never have imagined anything like that happening,” she said in a phone interview.
“I’m of course, very grateful for that, very honoured,” Thunberg said, but added: “It should be everyone in the Fridays for Future movement because what we have done, we have done together.”
Thunberg said she hoped the message being pushed by her and other activists — that governments need to drastically increase their efforts to combat climate change — is finally getting through. The “Greta effect” has already been linked to a rise in support for environmental parties in Europe.
But she insisted that the media should also pay attention to other activists, particularly indigenous people, whom she said “are hit hardest by the climate and environmental crisis.”
Her concern over the slayings of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon drew a harsh rebuke from the Latin American nation’s president Tuesday.
“Greta said that the Indians died because they were defending the Amazon,” Jair Bolsonaro said. “It’s impressive that the press is giving space to a brat like that,” he added, using the Portuguese word ”pirralha.”
Thunberg responded by changing her bio on Twitter, where she has over 3 million followers, to say “Pirralha.”
The teenager has also been a strong advocate of science, regularly citing complex studies about the causes and impacts of climate change.
On Wednesday, Thunberg used her address at the UN’s annual climate summit to accuse governments and businesses of misleading the public by holding talks that she said aren’t going to stop the world’s “climate emergency.”
“The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR,” she said.
Thunberg cited scientific reports showing that national pledges to reduce reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions aren’t enough to meet the ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsis (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.
“This is not leading, this is misleading,” she told officials, adding that “every fraction of a degree matters.”
Thunberg said the youth climate movement, which has staged repeated worldwide protests attended by hundreds of thousands of people, has managed to spread awareness about the need to urgently emissions and help those already affected by global warming.
“To get in a sense of urgency in the conversation that is very needed right now to be able to move forward,” she said. “That, I think, is our biggest success.”
Asked whether she thought world leaders were beginning to respond to this message, Thunberg told the AP: “They say they listen and they say they understand, but it sure doesn’t seem like it.”
“If they really would listen and understand then I think they need to prove that by translating that into action,” she added.
Thunberg said the experience of the past 15 months, going from solo-protester outside the Swedish parliament to speaking in front of world leaders at the UN General Assembly, had changed her.
“I think life is much more meaningful now that I have something to do that has an impact,” she said.
Thunberg has tried to preserve some privacy despite the relentless interest she’s received from media and adoring fans.
She was mobbed on her arrival in Madrid last week and the attention paid to her appearances at the climate conference has far outstripped that of other events, save for Hollywood stars like Harrison Ford.
“I would like to be left alone,” Thunberg said when asked about her immediate plans. But before heading home to Sweden, to spend Christmas with her family and dogs, she will attend a climate protest Friday in Turin, Italy.
“After that, I have no school to return to until August because I’ve taken a gap year,” she said.
“I will probably continue a bit like now, travel around. And if I get invitations, to come. And just try everything I can,” she added.
Last year’s Time winners included slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi; the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, where five people were shot to death; Philippine journalist Maria Ressa; and two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.

The information was made public at a press conference organised jointly by Bookworm Foundation and Random Readers Society here on Tuesday.

On the occasion, the Foundation’s director Ajit Baral said that new speakers would be given a chance in response to complaints that familiar faces appeared at the forum every year.
More than 110 speakers including over a dozen foreign writers are expected to participate in the festival with more than 40 sessions. Participation of foreign writers is expected to boost the sector of Nepali literature, said Baral.
The festival’s four editions were organised in Kathmandu and the rest in Pokhara. Pokhara was picked for the festival in a bid to promote literary tourism, said Baral, adding that the venue was also shifted due to the 2015 earthquake.
The Society’s President Keshab Sharan Lamichhane claimed that the festival had helped explore Pokhara’s literature.
The DSC Award for South Asian Literature will also be presented at the festival. The award carrying a purse of USD 25,000 is an international literary prize given annually to writers of any ethnicity or nationality writing on South Asian themes such as politics, culture, history and people.

Sanna Marin, 34 from the dominant Social Democrats, was nominated on Sunday. Centre Party chief Katri Kulmuni, 32, will get the finance post when the full new cabinet is announced this week, party members said.
Finland‘s government resigned last week after the Centre Party said it had lost confidence in Social Democrat Prime Minister Antti Rinne over his handling of a postal strike.
The five parties in power – four of them led by women – decided to stay in coalition and continue with the same programmes, but said there would be a reshuffle.
“We want to make the axis between the prime minister and the finance minister work,” Kulmuni said. “That is the foundation for this new generation of collaboration (between the Social Democrats and the Centre Party),” she added.
There was no immediate comment from Marin, the former transport minister.
She has had a swift rise in Finnish politics since becoming head of the city council of her industrial hometown of Tampere at the age of 27.
She will take over in the middle of a wave of strikes, which will halt production at some of Finland‘s largest companies from Monday. The Confederation of Finnish Industries estimates the strikes will cost the companies a combined 500 million euros ($550 million) in lost revenue.
Kulmuni, who previously held the more junior position of Minister of Economic Affairs, replaces Mika Lintila. She took over as the head of the Centre Party from ex-prime minister Juha Sipila in September.
Green Party leader Maria Ohisalo, 34, will continue as interior minister, the Left Alliance’s chairwoman Li Andersson, 32, as education minister and the Swedish People’s Party’s Anna-Maja Henriksson, 55, as justice minister.
Rinne will remain the Social Democrats leader at least until he chairs the party’s conference in June.

203,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australia-braces-for-more-fires-as-extreme-temperatures-predicted/,"SYDNEY: Thousands of firefighters were fortifying containment lines on Monday as temperatures were forecast to soar, increasing the danger of a fresh wave of bushfires across Australia‘s east coast.
More 100 fires remain ablaze in the region, and authorities warned conditions would worsen on Tuesday when temperatures were predicted to top 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).
Seeking to minimise the threat, firefighters safely burned grassland around homes to remove fuel, said NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.
“Firefighters are trying to take advantage of the more moderate conditions… and establish as many significant containment options as they can,” Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. “It is an enormous amount of work with more than 2,000 people out in the field.”
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Such fires are common in Australia‘s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring this year have caught many by surprise. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
In the small city of Hawkesbury, about 50 km (31.1 miles) north-west of Sydney, residents joined firefighters to safeguard their properties.
Mayor Barry Calvert said residents were trying to clear foliage from around their homes, and opening gates to ensure emergency workers have access.
Calvert said many locals were struggling to move animals and livestock in an area renowned for breeding racehorses.
“We’ve opened the showground for people to move their animals, but many people here may have 20 horses and only two horse boxes so they can’t move them quickly,” Calvert told Reuters.
The wildfires have blanketed Sydney – home to more the 5 million people – in smoke and ash for more than a week, turning the daytime sky orange, obscuring visibility and prompting commuters to wear breathing masks.
Australia‘s worst bushfires on record destroyed thousands of homes in Victoria state in February 2009, killing 173 people and injuring 414.

In the book launch interaction held with veteran writers, sociologists and mediapersons, in Kathmandu, on Saturday, litterateur and writer Nayanraj Pandey said the novel ‘Dulari’ elaborated troubles and difficulties faced by Dalit communities especially Musahar.
He said novelist Muna Chaudhary has step-by-step presented the economic exploitation imposed by society on people from marginalised communities and added that the author also cleverly uses Tharu terms and has described them in Nepali to make readers understand. Pandey, however, pointed out that readers would have to keep patience as the main plot unfolds very slowly as the story develops.

Likewise, sociologist Priyanka Kapar said the novel was equally suitable for people from different walks of life as it has touched on the reality of the present state of affairs in Tarai. She said the novel compelled her to recollect how Tharu people practised the ‘untouchability’ with various Dalit communities. She said she was impressed with the author’s way of addressing how women lose their names after getting married in Tarai. However, she pointed out that the novel lacks a historical background of the Musahar community.
Similarly, publishing team member Anbika Giri thanked author Chaudhary for her effort to write a novel on the isolated story. She said the story matches reality as it includes the conditions of people reeling under poverty in Tarai.
Novelist Muna Chaudhary said she found her aspiration to write the novel from her day-to-day experiences and her encouraging husband. She said the novel presents the story of a woman born in a Dalit community and the difficulties and challenges she faces due to limitation set against a marginalised community. The story is narrated from a woman’s perspective.

There were 96 fires burning in New South Wales, home to Australia’s largest city of Sydney, with only about a half contained and more than 1,600 firefighters deployed to do back burning and create containment lines.
Sydney with its population of 5.2 million has been blanketed by unhealthy haze and smoke for weeks, with conditions worsening on Friday as several fires merged into a giant blaze that may take weeks to put out.
Australia has been through some devastating bushfires before during its hot summers, but fire officials have said that this earlier-than-usual wave of fires has been one of the most persistent and largest.
NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told Australia’s ABC television on Sunday that temperatures will be raising to above normal by Tuesday, reaching 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), threatening the spread of the fires and new blazes.
More smoke is to be expected around Sydney on Sunday as firefighters will do preventive work.
“Crews are going to be actively out there lighting up large tracts of land, kilometres of trails and tracks, and getting into bushland areas in an attempt to bring those fires under control and start putting it into consolidation with containment lines,” Fitzsimmons said.
The fires have been blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson and with much of the country under a long-lasting drought, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been under pressure to address the impact of climate change.
In mid-November, 14 mayors of fire-stricken areas signed a letter urging the government to acknowledge a correlation between climate change and the devastating bushfires, asking also for more funds.
While some additional money has been provided, Morrison has repeatedly rejected any links between the fires and his conservative policies, including support for the coal industry.
On Saturday, the government issued a report suggesting that Australia is on track to meet its emission reduction target, which under the Paris Agreement calls for the country to reduce its emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2030.
The government acknowledged, however, that it uses so-called carryover credits, which allow for counting emissions reduction from the past towards future targets – a practice criticised by the European Union and Pacific countries threatened by climate change.

206,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/nobel-literature-winner-dreams-of-a-new-narrative-style/,"STOCKHOLM: Nobel Literature Prize winner Olga Tokarczuk says she thinks a new sort of fiction may be needed to counteract the modern era’s tendency to isolate and divide people.
In her Saturday lecture in Stockholm ahead of receiving the prize next week, the Polish author complained of the “exhausting white noise of oceans of information” in the internet era.

“It has turned out that we are not capable of bearing this enormity of information, which instead of uniting, generalizing and freeing, has differentiated, divided and enclosed us in individual little bubbles,” she said.
Tokarczuk suggested this discourages people from understanding how actions are interconnected, thus contributing to climate crisis and political tensions.
She said she dreams of a new kind of “fourth-person” narrator in fiction who could encompass the views of each character in a novel.
“We can regard this figure of a mysterious, tender narrator as miraculous and significant. This is a point of view, a perspective, from which everything can be seen. Seeing everything means recognizing the ultimate fact that all things that exist are mutually connected into a single whole, even if the connections between them are not yet known to us,” she said.
Tokarczuk is the 2018 literature laureate.  Her prize was announced only two months ago because the Swedish Academy postponed naming a winner last year due to internal turmoil connected with a sex abuse scandal.
The 2019 Nobel Literature winner, Peter Handke, has also brought controversy to the body because of widespread criticism of him as an apologist for Serbian war crimes during the 1990s. One Swedish Academy member said he is boycotting Nobel ceremonies this year in protest of Handke’s selection and a member of the literature nominating committee has announced his resignation.
Handke jousted with journalists who were questioning his views at a Friday news conference, saying he preferred receiving soiled toilet paper to answering their questions. But his lecture on Saturday was contemplative, telling how his writing was first inspired by religious litanies he heard from a village church. He concluded by reciting a poem by the late Swedish Nobel laureate Tomas Transtomer in which an angel whispers “do not be afraid of being human.”
The Nobel prizes in physics, chemistry, medicine, economics and literature are being presented Tuesday in the Swedish capital.
Earlier Saturday, several Nobel laureates in science spoke about climate change at their news conferences in Stockholm.
Didier Queloz, an astronomer who shares this year’s Nobel physics prize for discovering a planet outside the Earth’s solar system, said people who shrug off climate change on the grounds that humans will eventually leave for distant planets are wrong.
“The stars are so far away I think we should not have any serious hope to escape the Earth,” Queloz said. “We’re not built to survive on any other planet than this one … we’d better spend our time and energy trying to fix it.”

Kathmandu, December 7 
A recent research conducted on 20 brick kilns of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur has revealed that brick kiln workers are at high risk of respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and asthma.
Among the 400 brick kiln workers, a total of 159 participants had suffered from flu one month prior to the survey. Meanwhile, 91 participants (22.8 per cent) had pneumonia.
The research conducted by Resource Centre for Primary Health Care revealed that 75.5 per cent participants were not aware of chronic diseases. The research also revealed that workers were susceptible to body aches and joint pain because they had to carry heavy loads.

“As brick kiln workers have to work with dust and smoke, they are likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses such as asthma, chronic cough, chronic bronchitis, and wheezing, said Dr Kedar Narsingh KC, chest physician.
Dust particles and carbon dioxide from the burning of bricks impacts the health of brick kiln workers and the public. “People are likely to suffer from bronchitis and asthma. Long-term exposure to such particles lead to hypertension, cardiac problems and cancer. Also, exposure to such particles lead to skin problems such as irritation of skin and allergies,” Dr KC added
“The research was conducted to know the health status of workers in brick kilns. It was also conducted to find information regarding occupational safety,” said Purna Duwal, a researcher.
From among the participants, 75.5 per cent did not know about chronic health impacts of dust and smoke.
Meanwhile, 61.8 per cent of the participants knew about the importance of wearing mask. “Though brick kiln workers were given masks to prevent exposure to dust particles and smoke, they did not use them as ordinary masks made breathing difficult,” said Duwal. The research team has recommended that special masks be provided to enable workers to breathe easily. It has also recommended that new tools and equipment be used in brick kilns to lessen the smoke and its health hazards.
The research also revealed that 69.5 per cent brick kiln workers had to spend their own money on treatment.
“Immediate action should be taken to reduce brick kiln workers’ exposure to smoke and dust,” said Dr KC.

The measles virus has infected almost 4,500 people in the South Pacific nation of just 200,000 since late October. Of those who died, 57 were children under the age of four.
The mandatory immunisation campaign aims to vaccinate 90% of the population, tripling Samoa‘s coverage in just a few weeks. The government said a rate of 89% had been achieved as of Friday.
Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as parents shun immunisation for philosophical or religious reasons, or fears, debunked by doctors, that such vaccines could cause autism.
Samoa and the United Nations appealed on Friday to the international community for about $10.7 million to battle and recover from the crisis.
“The impacts of this emergency will be far reaching on Samoa and our people, particularly our young generations,” Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said in a statement.
“It is imperative therefore to strengthen the culture of acceptance of vaccination in order to create ‘herd immunity’. This is a painful lesson we have learnt from the current crisis.”
New Zealand and a number of other countries and organisations, including the UN agency UNICEF, have delivered thousands of vaccines, medical supplies and have sent medical personnel to help with the outbreak.
The World Health Organisation said this week that measles infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children.
The picture for 2019 is even worse, it said, with provisional data up to November showing a three-fold increase in case numbers compared with the same period in 2018.

209,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/activists-cheer-for-greta-urge-climate-action-in-madrid/,"MADRID: Activists of all ages and from all corners of the planet demanded concrete action Friday against climate change from leaders and negotiators at a global summit in Madrid.
The march was led by dozens of representatives of Latin America’s indigenous peoples — a mark of deference after anti-government protests in Chile, the original host of the summit, resulted in the talks suddenly being moved to Europe for the third year in a row.

Celebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg declared from a stage that “change is not going to come from the people in power, it’s going to come from the masses.” A crowd of thousands responded chanting “Greta! Greta!”
Organisers claimed 500,000 people turned out for the march, but authorities in Madrid put the number at 15,000 without an immediate explanation for the disparity in the count.
The Swedish teen was followed on her first day in Madrid by a swarm of cameras and reporters, as well as curious members of the public wanting to film her on their smartphones, from the very first step she took out of an overnight train from Lisbon.
Two young activists earned cheers as they abseiled from a bridge and strung out a banner saying: “Just 8 years till 1.5 degrees C. HOW DARE YOU?” — a reference to scientists’ forecasts of rising temperatures and what activists complain is a lack of a convincing political response to the threat.
The crush as people tried to get a glimpse of Thunberg led her to pull out shortly after the start of the march, saying police had advised her to leave for safety’s sake, and she climbed into an electric car.
A Madrid police spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity because she wasn’t authorised to be named in media reports said that it had only been “suggested” to that Thunberg leave after she appeared “overwhelmed” by the attention and that police never ordered the activist to abandon on safety grounds.
Earlier in the day, the 16-year-old had said at a press conference that calls for real action against climate change are still being “ignored” by political leaders despite their continuous praise of the global environmental youth movement she helped create.
Thunberg hoped the COP25 summit would lead to “something concrete” and “increasing awareness among people in general,” but she said that after more than one year of student strikes” still basically nothing has happened.”
“The climate crisis is still being ignored by those in power,” she added.
During the Dec. 2-13 talks, nearly 200 countries are meant to streamline the rules on global carbon markets and agree on how poor countries should be compensated for destruction largely caused by emissions from rich nations.
An official directly involved in the negotiations said that despite a few setbacks, the technical negotiations were progressing, although many issues were being left for ministerial-level meetings in the summit’s second and final week.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the discussions, added that a political declaration on greater “ambition” — a buzzword at the summit — was shaping to be “difficult to achieve.”
“A summit that doesn’t end with enhanced ambition would be something that nobody would understand if we take into account what the streets and science are telling us,” the official said.
The talks came as evidence mounts about disasters that could ensue from further global warming, including a study published Friday predicting that unchecked climate change could devastate fishery industries and coral reef tourism.
The study commissioned by 14 nations whose economies rely heavily on the sea says climate change could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in losses by 2050, adding that limiting global warming would lessen the economic impact for coastal countries, but that they also need to adapt to ocean changes.
Demands for greater action by non-governmental organisations and a whole new generation of environment-minded activists were expected to take the spotlight with the presence of Thunberg in Madrid.
Past appearances have won her plaudits from some leaders — and criticism from others who’ve taken offence at the angry tone of her speeches.
Asked about the scepticism on global efforts to fight the warming temperatures expressed by some world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, she said: “Some people want everything to continue like now, they are afraid of the change that we, the youth, are bringing.”
“They try so desperately to silence us,” she added.
Next to her, Vanessa Nakate, a 22-year-old member of Uganda’s chapter of Fridays for Future said that young activists don’t want more promises.
“We are tired of the praises that you keep giving the activists,” she said. “We want you to act.”
During a brief visit to the summit venue earlier on Friday, Thunberg did not appear unsettled by the commotion surrounding her presence.
“It’s absurd. I laugh at it. I do not understand why it has become like this,” she was quoted as saying by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet.
“I don’t like being at the centre of the focus all the time, but this is a good thing,” she told Aftonbladet. “As soon as the media writes about me, they also have to write about the climate crisis. If this is a way to write about the climate crisis, then I guess it is good.”
Separately Friday, an alliance of American states, cities, academic institutions and companies opened its own venue at the UN climate talks, aiming to show that despite the federal administration’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris accord, many Americans remain committed to the treaty’s goal of curbing global warming.
Elan Strait, who manages the “We Are Still In” initiative for the environmental conservationist World Wildlife Fund, said the movement is “a short-term band-aid not only to get those carbon dioxide emissions down but also to encourage policymakers to lay the ground for further achievements.”
“And that, regardless of the colour of the government that is in power,” Strait said.
Over 3,800 organizations and corporations representing 70% of US economic output have joined the coalition, organizers claim, amounting to roughly half of the country’s emissions.

210,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/giant-fire-near-sydney-may-burn-for-weeks-as-people-struggle-to-breathe/,"MELBOURNE: A giant bushfire on the edge of Sydney, which has blanketed the city in smoke causing a spike in respiratory illnesses and the cancellation of outdoor sports, will take weeks to control but will not be extinguished without heavy rains, firefighters said.
Thousands of weary firefighters, who have been battling bushfires for a month, were on Saturday fighting nearly 100 blazes in New South Wales state.
The mega fire north of Sydney, Australia’s largest city, was created on Friday when several fires merged and was now burning across 335,000 hectares (830,000 acres).
“We need flooding rain to put these fires out. That’s really what is going to stop it,” said the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “These will take many weeks to put out.”
Bushfires are common in Australia during the hot summer, which begins in December, but this year the fires started much earlier, blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson.
A three-year drought has left much of Australia tinder dry.
The fires around Sydney have been pumping such vast amounts of smoke into the air that they appear as significant rain on the radars, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.
New South Wales Health said late on Friday that some 1,140 people had sought medical assistance for breathing issues or asthma in the past week – a quarter more than in a typical week. NSW Ambulance fielded about a third more calls.
Six people have been killed, nearly 700 houses burnt down and millions of hectares of land razed.
Strong winds fanned flames towards several suburbs in southwest Sydney on Saturday.
“It’s been going on all day, a fire came from the back and we put it out. But then another one came from the side so the firies covered the house in foam.,” said Luke Wright who helped save his brother’s home.
“The fence has been damaged but that’s about it, very lucky,” Wright told local media.
Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said the worst might still be ahead, with temperatures forecast to rise into the 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in coming days and no meaningful rainfall expected until late January.
“It’s a tough couple of months ahead yet and we’ve already seen the horrific consequences of fire so far this season,” Fitzsimmons told Australia’s 9News on Saturday.
Neighbouring Queensland state was battling some 45 bushfires and temperatures on Saturday as high as 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).

211,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/extreme-heat-hitting-rich-and-poor-harder-global-climate-index-shows/,"MADRID: Worsening heatwaves are taking a heavier toll on rich as well as poor countries, according to an annual ranking that measures the damage done by extreme weather to human life and economies.
The Global Climate Risk Index, published on Wednesday by environmental think-tank Germanwatch, rated Japan as the most weather-affected country in 2018, hit by a triple whammy of extreme summer heat, torrential rainfall and the most powerful typhoon in a quarter-century.
Germany, another industrialised country, was in third position as its hottest-ever April-July period led to the deaths of more than 1,200 people and widespread drought in 2018.
India – in fifth position – suffered one of its longest-ever heatwaves that year, bringing water shortages, crop failures and riots, on top of monsoon floods and two strong cyclones, Germanwatch said in a report.
“Recent science has confirmed the long-established link between climate change and the frequency and severity of extreme heat,” it added in a statement.
In 2018, the severe summer heatwave in Japan killed 138 people and caused more than 70,000 people to be hospitalised with heat stroke and exhaustion, the report said.
Across Europe, scientists calculate extreme heat spells are now up to 100 times more likely than a century ago, it added.
The report noted that the impact of heatwaves on African nations may be under-represented due to a lack of data.
Powerful storms, meanwhile, left a trail of destruction in 2018, with the Philippines second in the climate risk index due to large losses inflicted by top-strength Typhoon Mangkhut.
Madagascar was the fourth most weather-hit country as two cyclones killed about 70 people and forced 70,000 to seek refuge.
In Kenya and Rwanda – seventh and eighth in the index – seasonal rains were much heavier than normal, causing floods that destroyed homes and livestock and fuelled diseases.
Laura Schaefer, a policy advisor with Germanwatch, told journalists at the U.N. climate talks in Madrid that the index results showed that the “signs of climate crisis”, on all continents, could no longer be ignored.
“But climate impacts most existentially hit developing countries and communities around the world – and create a real climate crisis for millions of people,” she said, adding that the poor had the fewest resources to cope.
Between 1999 and 2018, seven of the 10 places most affected by extreme weather were lower-income developing nations, with Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti at the top, Germanwatch said.
In the past 20 years, nearly half a million deaths were directly linked to more than 12,000 extreme weather events worldwide, while economic damages exceeded $3.5 trillion, the report said.
At the U.N. climate talks on Wednesday, Chile’s environment minister, who is presiding over the conference, and U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa told journalists Latin American nations were vulnerable to weather disasters fuelled by climate change, highlighting the need for them to become more resilient.
Espinosa said her own country, Mexico, suffered every year from droughts, floods and wildfires.
“It is not about whether this year it will be bad. No, it is about how bad and where?” she said. “This is the reality of almost all the countries in the region.”
Germanwatch joined developing states and aid agencies in urging U.N. negotiators to regularly assess the needs of vulnerable countries struggling with “loss and damage” linked to climate change, and provide new funding to repair it.
Wealthy nations have long resisted pressure to stump up such finance, beyond expanding insurance programmes. But as the cost of extreme weather increases globally and planet-heating emissions continue to rise, that pressure is growing.
Renato Redentor Constantino, head of the Philippines-based Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities, said it was “plainly unacceptable” that those suffering the most had done the least to cause the problem, given their historically low emissions.
“The extreme weather events we have been facing are a result of emissions that the world failed to eliminate,” he said.

212,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/malaria-cases-decline-in-who-south-east-asia-region-who-says-efforts-must-continue-as-risks-persist/,"KATHMANDU: Malaria is on a steep decline in the WHO South-East Asia Region, as per the World Malaria Report published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday.
The report states that 11 countries in WHO South-East Asia Region — Bangladesh, Bhutan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Timor-Leste — had an estimated eight million cases and 11,600 malaria deaths, respectively 69 and 70 per cent less compared to 2010. Moreover, the Maldives and Sri Lanka have been certified malaria-free countries while Timor-Leste and Bhutan are close to elimination target.
The WHO report further stated that India reduced its reported cases by half as compared to 2017 and Bangladesh and Thailand also reported a substantial decline in reported cases.
All countries in the region are on target to achieve more than 40 per cent reduction in case incidence by 2020, and all have strategic plans for malaria elimination by 2030.
“There is a strong commitment to eliminate malaria in the region, reflected in the commendable intense efforts and progress being made by member countries. This momentum needs to be sustained and further accelerated to prevent, rapidly detect and treat malaria, to benefit everyone, everywhere,” Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia was quoted in the statement released by WHO.
However, the report claimed that despite progress, an estimated 1.61 billon people in the region are still at risk of contracting malaria with the disease being endemic in nine countries.
The progress and challenges in malaria elimination are periodically reviewed by member countries.

213,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/women/first-period-in-school-award-winning-uk-film-upends-bloody-shame/,"
LONDON: The award-winning short film, “My Time”, was inspired by seeing a friend being bullied at school for having a period stain on her clothes, its director Giulia Gandini said on Tuesday.
The young girl had just started her first period but the teacher refused to allow her to use the toilet during class – a rule that applies to seven out of 10 girls in Britain today, according to the children’s charity Plan International.

“I wish that I had seen this film when I was 12,” the London-based director, who grew up in Italy, said at a screening on Tuesday. “I developed this relationship to menstrual blood that was very negative.”
Gandini’s film is the latest to tackle the stigma around menstruation, following last year’s Bollywood movie “Padman” and the Netflix documentary “Period. End of Sentence.”, which won an Oscar this year.
Shame can be deadly. In Nepal, the centuries-old Hindu practise of “chhaupadi”, where women are banished from their homes during their periods, has led to numerous deaths from suffocation and snake bites.
Despite government schemes to provide free sanitary products in British schools, “period shaming” persists, with one in three women saying they have been bullied, isolated or joked about over “the curse”, research by the charity ActionAid found.
“It was a deliberate choice to set it in the UK – you still have this kind of shame and taboo,” said Gandini, adding that she only “started questioning why I was feeling so awful about something so natural” years after her friend’s humiliation.
Gandini said her goal as a filmmaker is to dispel stigmas and show the reality of young women’s lives in a positive light.
“Films don’t only reflect culture but they have the power to shape it,” she said, highlighting negative comments she received from men while making the film, with some asking, “Why should I care about menstrual blood?”
“My Time” has won multiple awards, including at the Chicago International Children’s Film Festival, London’s TweetFest and Sweden’s BUFF International Film Festival.
Gandini said her film has a happier ending than the event she witnessed at school, with a clear feminist message of “being proud of who you are”.

214,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/drug-can-curb-dementias-delusions-researchers-find/,"SAN DIEGO: A drug that curbs delusions in Parkinson’s patients did the same for people with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia in a study that was stopped early because the benefit seemed clear.
If regulators agree, the drug could become the first treatment specifically for dementia-related psychosis and the first new medicine for Alzheimer’s in nearly two decades. It targets some of the most troubling symptoms that patients and caregivers face — hallucinations that often lead to anxiety, aggression, and physical and verbal abuse.
Results were disclosed Wednesday at a conference in San Diego.
“This would be a very important advance,” said one independent expert, Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation.
Although the field is focused on finding a cure for dementia and preventing future cases, “there is a huge unmet need for better treatment” for those who have it now, said Maria Carrillo, the Alzheimer’s Association’s chief science officer.
The drug is pimavanserin, a daily pill sold as Nuplazid by Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. It was approved for Parkinson’s-related psychosis in 2016 and is thought to work by blocking a brain chemical that seems to spur delusions.
About 8 million Americans have dementia, and studies suggest that up to 30% of them develop psychosis.
“It’s terrifying,” said Dr. Jeffrey Cummings of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. “You believe that people might be trying to hurt you. You believe that people are stealing from you. You believe that your spouse is unfaithful to you. Those are the three most common false beliefs.”
He consults for Acadia and helped lead the study, which included about 400 people with dementia and psychosis. All were given a low dose of the drug for three months, and those who seemed to respond or benefit were then split into two groups. Half continued on the drug and the others were given dummy pills for six months or until they had a relapse or worsening of symptoms. Neither the patients nor their doctors knew who was getting what.
Independent monitors stopped the study when they saw that those on dummy pills were more than twice as likely as those on the drug to relapse or worsen — 28% versus nearly 13%.
There were relatively few serious side effects — 5% in the drug group and 4% in the others. Headaches and urinary tract infections were more common among those on the drug. Two deaths occurred, but study leaders said neither was related to the drug.
Carrillo said the study was small, but the drug’s effect seemed large, and it’s not known whether the federal Food and Drug Administration would want more evidence to approve a new use.
Current anti-psychotic medicines have some major drawbacks and are not approved for dementia patients.
“They’re often used off label because we have very few other options,” Fillit said.
All carry warnings that they can raise the risk of death in elderly patients, as does Nuplazid.
Cost could be an issue — about $3,000 a month. What patients pay can vary depending on insurance coverage.

215,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/restoring-forests-1-tree-at-a-time-to-help-repair-climate/,"MADRE DE DIOS, PERU: Destruction of the forests can be swift. Regrowth is much, much slower.
But around the world, people are putting shovels to ground to help it happen.
They labour amid spectacular recent losses — the Amazon jungle and the Congo basin ablaze, smoke from Indonesian rainforests wafting over Malaysia and Singapore, fires set mostly to make way for cattle pastures and farm fields. Between 2014 and 2018, a new report says, an area the size of the United Kingdom was stripped of forest each year.


Rebuilding woodland is slow and often difficult work. And it requires patience: It can take several decades or longer for forests to regrow as viable habitats, and to absorb the same amount of carbon lost when trees are cut and burned.
And yet, there is urgency to that work — forests are one of the planet’s first lines of defense against climate change, absorbing as much as a quarter of man-made carbon emissions each year.
Through photosynthesis, trees and other plants use carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to produce chemical energy to fuel their growth; oxygen is released as a byproduct. As forests have shrunk, however, so has an already overloaded Earth’s capacity to cope with carbon emissions.
Successful reforestation programs take into account native plant species. They are managed by groups with a sustained commitment to monitoring forests, not just one-off tree planting events. And usually, they economically benefit the people who live nearby — for instance, by creating jobs, or reducing erosion that damages homes or crops.
The impact could be great: A recent study in the journal Science projected that if 0.9 billion hectares (2.2 billion acres) of new trees were planted — around 500 billion saplings — they could absorb 205 gigatonnes (220 gigatons) of carbon once they reached maturity. The Swiss researchers estimated this would be equivalent to about two-thirds of man-made carbon emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
Other scientists dispute those calculations, while some fear the theoretical promise of tree-planting as an easy solution to climate changes could distract people from the range and scope of the responses needed.
But all agree that trees matter. And in many places around the world, people are working to revive them:
— In a region of southeastern Peru called Madre de Dios, forestry researcher Jhon Farfan inspects lands where the forest has already been lost to illegal gold mining.
After cutting and burning centuries-old trees, miners used diesel pumps to suck up deep layers of the earth, then pushed the soil through filters to separate out gold particles. To turn gold dust into nuggets, they stirred in mercury, which binds the gold together but also poisons the land.
Left behind are patches of desert-like land — dry, sandy, stripped of topsoil and ringed by trunks of dead trees.
Last December, Farfan and other scientists with the Peru-based nonprofit CINCIA planted more than 6,000 saplings of various species native to this part of the Amazon, including the giant shihuahuaco, and tested different fertilizers. Since the project began three years ago, the team has planted more than 42 hectares (115 acres) with native seedlings, the largest reforestation effort in the Peruvian Amazon to date.
— After miners left West Virginia’s Cheat Mountain in the 1980s, there was an effort to green the coal mining sites to comply with US law. The companies used heavy machinery to push upturned soil back into place, compacting the mountainside with bulldozers. The result was soil so packed in that rainwater couldn’t seep down, and tree roots couldn’t expand.
Companies planted “desperation species” — grasses with shallow roots or non-native trees that could endure, but wouldn’t reach their full height or restore the forest as it had been. On Cheat Mountain and at other former mining sites across Appalachia, more than a million acres of former forests are in similar arrested development.
Now Michael French, director of operations for the Kentucky-based nonprofit Green Forests Work, and his colleagues are collaborating with the US Forest Service to restore native Appalachian forests and the rare species they support — by first tearing down other trees.
Green Forests Work has reforested around 800 acres within the Monongahela, and it is taking a similar approach to other former mining sites across Appalachia, having reforested around 4,500 total acres since 2009.
— Maria Coelho da Fonseca Machado Moraes, nicknamed Dona Graça, runs a tree nursery that grows seedlings of species native to Brazil’s lesser-known jungle — the Atlantic coastal rainforest.
She collaborates with a nonprofit group called Save the Golden Lion Tamarin, which works to protect and restore the forest habitat of the endangered namesake monkey. “The Atlantic rainforest is one of the planet’s most threatened biomes, more than 90% of it was deforested,” said Luis Paulo Ferraz, the nonprofit’s executive secretary. “What is left is very fragmented.”
As she nears 50, Dona Graça says she is furious at what has happened to the forest, which was whittled down to allow for the urban expansion of Rio de Janeiro and other cities.
And so, between feeding her chickens and raking the leaves, she grows seedlings of rare species. She mixes limestone and clay, places it in plastic nursery bags and plants seeds in them. She irrigates them with water and cow urine.
Local replanting efforts — which aim to reconnect fragmented parcels of forest — often use the seedlings from Dona Graça’s nursery.
She does this, she said, for posterity.
“In the future when I pass away … that memory I tried to leave for the people is: It’s worth it to plant, to build,” she said.

As the mountain guides are the backbone of the climbing industry, the government must work for the betterment of their profession, the guides said, while marking the 14th National Mountain Guide Day here today.
President of Nepal National Mountain Guide Association Ang Norbu Sherpa said that mountain guides are often low-paid and there is no guarantee of social security. “The guides always risk their lives to support the expedition members on different mountains so their contribution to the climbing industry must be honoured,” he added.
Mountain guides worked for the welfare and safety of climbing members but the concerned stakeholders have not increased their investment in them, he said.

On the occasion,  NNMGA also awarded certificates to five new IFMGA mountain guides and four aspirant guides who successfully completed the 11th batch of NNMGA course in 2019.
Secretary at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Kedar Bahadur Adhikari, Director General at the Department of Tourism Dandu Raj Ghimire and NNMGA President Sherpa jointly also awarded certificates to 11 guides who completed the level IV of the National Skill Testing Board exams under CTEVT.
“The NNMGA is committed to providing necessary trainings to produce trained manpower, provide quality service and minimise risks relating to mountaineering,” Sherpa said.
NNMGA has also inked a memorandum of understanding with Nepal Mountaineering Association for five years to jointly conduct mountain and aspirant guides training courses, he added.
According to him, Aspirant Guide Course, which consists of three components spread over a span of 10 months, incorporates a total of 47 training days. It is the first step to pursue advanced International Mountain Guide – IFMGA.
After completing two years in the guiding field, aspirant guides can take IFMGA exam by fulfilling additional criteria. Two trekking peak ascents, one expedition style ascent with at least two camps in altitude and eight days of ascents (without clients) on all type of terrain are other criteria for aspirant guides to take part in IFMGA course.
NNMGA had launched aspirant guide training in 2007 while the first batch of international mountain guide graduated in 2009. NNMGA graduates were highly capable of providing safe and quality guide services in climbing and mountaineering activities, NMA President Santa Bir Lama said.
According to Sobit Kuwar, Chief Administrative Officer at NNMGA, there are now 63 IFMGA-accredited Nepali mountain guides in the country while NNMGA has eight more trained aspirant mountain guides who are working in the field of mountaineering till date.

247,https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/paudel-faction-rejects-decision-to-extend-leaderships-tenure/,"Kathmandu, December 28
The rival faction of the Nepali Congress led by Ramchandra Paudel organised a press conference today saying it would not accept the establishment faction’s decision to extend the tenure of the party’s leadership by one year.
A meeting of the NC’s Central Working Committee, which the Paudel faction boycotted, had decided yesterday to extend the tenure of the current leadership by one year from 3 March 2020 when the tenure of office bearers would end.
NC CWC had yesterday prepared the calendar of events for the next national convention proposing to hold it from February 19 to 22 in 2021. Paudel said his faction wanted the party to hold its next national convention by mid-December next year, not beyond that.
Flanked by party General Secretary Shashank Koirala and another leader Prakash Man Singh, Paudel said while his party opposed the Nepal Communist Party (NCP)-led government’s unilateral move of making appointments in constitutional bodies in the name of majority, it was now witnessing a similar practice within the party as party President Sher Bahadur Deuba had unilaterally decided to extend his tenure and prepare the calendar of events for the next National Convention.
Paudel said he would not accept the CWC’s decision extending the tenure of party office bearers and Deuba had to correct the decision. Deuba’s decision to extend his tenure is against the spirit of the party’s statute, its tradition and democratic norms, Paudel argued.
Asked what he would do if the party president did not correct the decision as per his faction’s demand, Paudel said his faction would consult all the cadres of the party and party wings on the next course of action. He said the establishment faction had amended the party’s statute to give active membership to party cadres immediately. “We are seriously concerned about the party’s decision to amend sensitive clauses of the party’s statute,” he added.
Paudel said Deuba’s decision had invited crisis in the NC, which was supposed to fight unitedly against the ‘undemocratic’ moves of the incumbent government.
Paudel said the CWC’s decision to increase the party’s departments from 28 to 47 was also wrong. It is a norm in democracy to avoid making new appointments during elections, but the establishment faction had decided to make appointments in the party’s departments soon, he argued.
Paudel said the establishment faction had failed to resolve the problems facing the NC’s student wing —Nepal Students Union.
Party General Secretary Shashank Koirala also opposed the establishment faction’s decision to extend the tenure saying the party’s decision failed to unite the party and had given rise to factionalism. “NC is plagued by factionalism. NC will have its future only when it can work as a united party,” he added.
Singh said Deuba had tried to forge consensus with the rival factions, but he unilaterally decided to extend his tenure without reaching consensus.

Addressing a press meet organised by the Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) in Pokhara today, Minister Bhattarai said that the country would move towards development and prosperity with coordination among all sectors. He said it took a relatively short time to implement the promulgated constitution in Nepal in comparison to other foreign countries. “Implementation of the new constitution found its roots in our country in a short time.”

He expressed that the number of tourists and foreign investors would grow in Nepal. Citing that the country recently exported 150 Megawatt of electricity after constructing a higher-capacity hydroelectricity plant, Minister Bhattarai said the country has become independent in energy sector.
Likewise, the Tourism Minister stated that preparations for Visit Nepal Year-2020 (VNY-2020) have been completed with the approach of the New Year, as per the Gregorian calendar.
In this context, he informed that preparations have been carried out to welcome around 2 million tourists and added that Tribhuvan International Airport, the sole international airport of the country, would be operated for 21 hours. More flights and airlines will be operated and the parking spaces have been enlarged.
Likewise, Minister Bhattarai also said that the operation of Gautam Buddha International Airport, by next year, would ease the movement of tourists. He, however, added that only airport infrastructure could not make the visit year successful.
He stressed that the provincial governments could bring forth new packages to make VNY-2020 campaign successful as the ministry has demanded a budget of Rs 650 million for the publicity of the campaign as the originally allocated Rs 100 million would not have been enough.
The minister also informed that 52 percent construction works of Pokhara Regional International Airport had been completed and remaining construction would be over by the beginning of 2021.
Furthermore, the tourism minister stressed the need for coordination among ministries in order to preserve the natural resources of the country, including Phewa Lake.

District Police Office, Kailali stated that illegal drugs easily enter Dhangadhi Sub-Metropolitan City owing to the open border between Nepal and India. Dhangadhi is located right at the Nepal-India border in the south-west part of the country and serves as the administrative centre of Kailali.
Youth of the region have become vulnerable to drug abuse and drug peddling. Last month, two teenagers were arrested in possession of illegal drugs in Milan Chok of Dhangadhi. Police investigation revealed that the youths — arrested while transporting Nitravet from the Indian side — were involved in the abuse and dealing of drugs. Residents of Doti, they had come to Dhangadhi to pursue their education. Police have sent both the teenagers to a juvenile correction centre.

Likewise, police took under custody three others, two teenaged girls and one youth, from a hotel room in Dhangadhi, in possession of about four grams of brown sugar. A charge has been filed against the three who have been implicated with drug abuse and drug trafficking.
These are only a couple of examples of how the youths in the region — men and women, girls and boys — have been falling into the trap of drugs. Only in the current fiscal year, 83 individuals have been arrested, out of which 53 cases have been registered at the court for prosecution. Among the arrested, the majority are young people who go to schools and colleges.
Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Dakshya Kumar Basnet at the DPO said, “Large number of young people being involved in drug abuse is a great loss to the nation.” He added that it is vital that such individuals are sent to rehabilitation, awareness programmes are carried out, and families are made alert to prevent more people from getting into the habit.
It is difficult to bring back people from the lethal habit only through legal action, said police, adding that awareness, counselling and support play a major role.

Kanti Lake, which is located on the border of Wards No 21 and 22 of Nepalgunj sub-metropolis, has been developed as a tourist destination.
The lake is being conserved and beautified at the cost of around Rs 95 million with the support of the sub-metropolis, according to Mayor Dhawal Shumsher Rana. He said the work on lake conservation and its infrastructure development would be completed within 18 months.
The lake was known as ‘Puraina’ or ‘Puraini’ lake. However, the name was changed to Kanti by the sub-metropolis after it decided to develop the lake as a tourist destination. The lake lies 2.5 km east from Dhambojhi chowk of Nepalgunj. The lake spreads over 25 bigha area — 17 bigha in Ward 22 of Puraini and eight bigha in Ward 21 of Puraina. In the past, water in the lake had been used for irrigation and later the lake was leased out for fish farming.
Of late, the sub-metropolis has floated a plan to develop the lake as a tourist destination. “Some three decades ago the lake area was popular as habitat for elephants. Various species of birds were spotted in the lake area.

DAO has asked all local levels to cooperate the bid to remove Chhau sheds in rural areas of the district. Though there are no chhau sheds in district headquarters Silgadhi, the structures prevail in rural areas. Police administration has also started collecting data about chhau sheds in rural area of Doti. Due to the prevalence of such malpractice, at least 12 women have so far lost their lives in the far-western region of Nepal.
Incidents of women being raped while spending nights in the sheds are increasing. However, no concrete efforts have been taken from bodies concerned to prevent such incidents. Chetraj Bhatta, a local of Kisingh Rural Municipality, said chhaupadi practice was still highly prevalent in rural areas of Doti and other adjoining districts.
“People have deep rooted belief that the gods maybe furious when chhau sheds are removed,” he said. In line with the directive of the Home Ministry, the DAO has taken bold action to demolish chhau sheds in Doti.

After the police investigation report in the case was submitted to the District Court of Sunsari yesterday, the court today recorded his statement wherein the accused denied the charge levelled against him.
Judge Radhakrishna Upreti of the court studied the investigation reported prepared by the police and the government attorney.

With the statement of the accused recorded today, trial hearing in the case will start from Sunday. Some 13 lawyers — five on behalf of the accused and eight, including six government attorneys, on behalf of the woman —will participate in the trial hearing. The charge sheet filed against the accused perpetrator by the government attorney at the court has mentioned Giri’s act as an offence as per the clause-219 of the National Criminal Code-2074 and has sought legal action accordingly. Compensation has also been sought for the victim. If convicted, Giri could face prison sentence from seven to 10 years.

Eighteen-year-old Mandira Adhikari, who had been missing from her home since December 3, was murdered at Fulbari of Athrai Triveni Rural Municipality, Taplejung.
District Police Office, Taplejung, alleged that Ramesh Adhikari of Dumrise, Sidingba Rural Municipality, had killed Mandira and thrown her body into the Tamor River.
Mandira had gone missing after she received a call on her phone on the evening of December 3. Police nabbed Ramesh two days ago after family members suspected his involvement in Mandira’s disappearance.
He confessed to the police that he had murdered Mandira.
Mandira was a 12th grader at local Durga Secondary School. Ramesh had rented a room at Mandira’s home ten months ago and used to teach at Gupteswor Secondary School.
According to Mandira’s uncle Chandra Adhikari, Ramesh had sent a message from Mandira’s Facebook account to her sister Alisha. The message read that she had got married to Narayan Poudel’s son Dipak Poudel at Jhapa’s Haldibari. After that, Mandira’s family members reached Jhapa’s Haldibari to take stock of the boy and his family in Jhapa. Surprisingly, they could not find the boy with the name Dipak in Haldibari.
Family members launched a search operation for Mandira thereafter. A few days later, another message came from Mandira’s Facebook account to Alisha saying a boy from the Dalit caste had taken her to India. She had posted a photo of a boy on her Facebook saying she had got married with him. After they could not believe the Facebook messages and photos, family members lodged a missing complaint with the District Police Office.
DSP Gyanendra Bahadur Phuyal said Ramesh had confessed to the police that he had sent the messages from Mandira’s mobile phone to Alisha after he killed her. “I posted a photo of an unknown boy to convince the family members,” Ramesh told the police.
This undated image shows murdered Mandira Adhikari (right) and murder accused Ramesh Adhikari of Fulbari, Athrai Triveni Rural Municipality, Taplejung. Photo courtesy: Mandira’s Facebook
According to police, Ramesh had taken Mandira to Mitla field, 40 minutes walk from Mandira’s home, murdered her there and thrown her body into the Tamor River from Mitla Bridge. Ramesh was preparing to tie the knot with a girl from Dumrise on December 11. As part of the wedding preparation, Ramesh had set out to Taplejung bazaar to buy his clothes on December 3. The same day he had taken Mandira to the Tamor River and murdered her, police told quoting Ramesh.
Ramesh told the police that he had killed Mandira, thrown her body into the Tamor River and sent the message to Alisha’s Facebook saying she had got married to a boy from Jhapa. After interrogation, police had reached the incident site with Ramesh. Police recovered Mandira’s outer, slippers, and a glove, said DSP Phuyal. Mandira’s body, however, was not found.
A preliminary police investigation showed that Ramesh had an affair with Mandira and he might have murdered her thinking that she might create problems for him to marry another girl. “He has been kept in custody for investigation,” added DSP Phuyal.

Kathmandu, December 27
The Parliament Secretariat postponed the second meeting of the House of Representatives scheduled for today till January 1 as Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Co-chair of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) Pushpa Kamal Dahal failed to pick their common candidate for the speaker.
The post of speaker remains vacant after Krishna Bahadur Mahara resigned from the post after he was accused of attempting to rape a female staffer of the Parliament Secretariat. Mahara is in judicial custody.
Spokesperson for the Parliament Secretariat Dasharath Dhamala said the secretariat postponed the House meeting till January 1 as the ruling NCP demanded more time for picking its candidate for the speaker.
Dhamala said the next meeting of the HoR would publish the timetable for speaker election which will end in two days. The Parliament Secretariat will give one day to the members of the HoR to file their nominations for speaker and another to elect the new speaker.
Dahal wants somebody from the former CPN-MC faction to become the new speaker, according to a source close to Dahal. The source said although former Maoist leaders Agni Prasad Sapkota, Dev Prasad Gurung and Pampha Bhusal had shown keen interest for the post of speaker, there would be no dissent within the former Maoist camp if Dahal chose any leader from his camp.  “Dahal’s nomination will not be opposed by anybody within the former Maoist camp,” the source said.
The source added that there was lack of unanimity among former UML leaders about who should be their candidate for the speaker. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, however, wants Subas Chandra Nembang to become the speaker again. The source said that Dahal, who was supposed to hold formal talks with Oli yesterday about  the party’s candidate for the speaker,  could not do so as he did not return to the capital from Chitwan for some reasons.
Dahal returned to Kathmandu today but could not hold talks with Oli again as the PM underwent dialysis.
Asked why the ruling NCP was taking time to pick its candidate for the speaker, a senior leader close to Oli said the two leaders also had to decide which party the ruling NCP should support for the post of deputy speaker. Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, who represented the former CPN-UML at the time of filing her candidacy, will have to resign if the NCP fielded its candidate for speaker as the constitution stipulates that the posts of speaker and deputy speaker should go to two different parties and genders.
Tumbahamphe could not be contacted for comments.
As NCP commands nearly two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives, it can easily ensure victory of its candidate for speaker.

257,https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/nepal-cracks-down-on-illegal-menstrual-huts-after-deaths/,"KATHMANDU: Anyone in Nepal banishing women to “menstrual huts” during their periods will forfeit state benefits as well as face up to three months in jail, according to a government crackdown on the illegal practice unveiled this week after several deaths.
Under the centuries-old “chhaupadi” system, superstitious families fearing misfortune send menstruating women and girls – seen as impure – away to animal sheds or huts and bar them from touching items such as religious idols, milk and cattle.

The system was banned in 2005 in the Himalayan nation but it remains in practice in some remote areas in west Nepal.
But several recent deaths in menstrual huts sparked national outrage and led to a parliamentary investigation into the system which continues despite a law carrying three month jail terms and fines of 3,000 rupees ($26).
Kedar Nath Sharma, a spokesman for the home (interior) ministry, said the government was cracking down after the most recent death this month when Parbati Buda Rawat, 21, suffocated after lighting a fire to keep warm in a hut in Achham district.
He said the government had asked chief district officers, police chiefs and government lawyers in all 19 administrative districts practicing chhaupadi to launch a massive awareness campaign to inform the community that the practice is illegal.
“To begin with we’ll stop giving state benefits like old-age pension and social securities, and pull down the huts to root it out,” Sharma told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“If they still continue the practice we will take the legal action,” he said, confirming this could mean up to three months in jail.
Kul Bahadur Kunwar, the mayor of the Sanfebagar municipality in Achham district, said authorities had already begun pulling down the illegal huts and people had responded positively.
Police arrested the brother-in-law of Parbati Buda Rawat, the first such arrest in Nepal as it seeks to end the practice.
A teenage girl and a mother and her young sons died earlier this year in two similar incidents to Parbati Buda Rawas’ death, leading to the parliamentary investigation.
Radha Paudel, who founded the Radha Paudel Foundation in 2016 to campaign for “dignified menstruation”, said she found many women still quietly lived in isolation during their periods due to superstition.
A recent study of 400 girls aged between 14 and 19 in mid-Western Nepal’s Karnali province found 77% practised chhaupadi despite the ban.
“A sustained and integrated campaign to end the deep rooted misconception about menstruation and fear is necessary to end the practice,” said Paudel, who ran away from her home at the age of 14 for fear of being banished on her first period. “Otherwise, women will continued to practice it and suffer.”

At a time when the entire country is gearing up to welcome a record number of visitors during the upcoming Visit Nepal Year 2020, a decision to ban Indian number plate vehicles in Pokhara, one of the most visited tourism destinations in the country during the New Year and Christmas celebrations, has created quite a controversy.
According to sources, the decision to ban Indian vehicles during Christmas and New Year was taken by Pokhara Tourism Council in consultation with the District Administration of Kaski, with a view to easing traffic congestion.
Meanwhile, the decision has drawn mixed reactions from tourism entrepreneurs.
Former chairperson of Western Regional Hotel Association Hari Gaire described the decision taken on the eve of the visit year as fatal. “Besides Indian vehicles, vehicles from other countries also arrive here, so what do we really want to suggest by singling out Indian vehicles and banning them?” he asked.
According to Chief District Officer Ramesh KC, the ban will be lifted once the traffic police are ready to manage the congestion resulting from influx of foreign vehicles. The council has requested Indian visitors to cooperate with the temporary provision and urged them to use local vehicles.
The controversial decision has even prompted Indian media to cover the news.
Pokhara Tourism Council Chairperson Chiranjivi Pokharel defended the decision citing the positive effects the decision would have on the local business of travel agencies, entrepreneurs and cabbies. “Only public vehicles have been banned, not private ones,” he explained.
“Indian vehicles don’t know the parking system and routes here, and will naturally cause traffic problem,” he said. “We’ll take another decision whether to lift the ban after Christmas and the New Year following consultation with stakeholders,” he added.

The bridge will connect people in the northern region of Dhading to accessible transportation services all-year-round.
Foundation stone for the bridge, 45-metre long and 8.4-metre wide, was laid on Thursday by Khem Prasad Lohani, a federal lawmaker elected from Dhading Constituency-2. The bridge is being constructed with the financial support of the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) with a total allocated budget of Rs 55.4 million.

The bridge over Lapang Khola lies along Dhading Besi–Sankosh Tipling–Somdang road section, which is the lifeline of locals as the road connects remote areas of Dhading with the district headquarters.
Lack of a concrete bridge over the river has been affecting a majority of villages in the region including Rubi Valley, Khaniyabas, Ganga Jamuna, Tripura Sundari, Netrawati, among others, during monsoons.
Rasuwa Construction Company (RCC)/JBNS JV has won the tender for the bridge construction, informed Jayaram Shrestha, head of Grant Management and Local Infrastructure, District Programme Implementation Unit of the NRA. The company should hand over the bridge within the stipulated deadline which is December 15, 2020, he added.
With the construction of the bridge, people living in the then VDCs — Tripureshwor, Gumdi, Marpak, Darkha, Satyadevi, Jharlang, Sertung, Rigaun, and Lapa — will have easy access to the road network.
Meanwhile, construction is underway for Darkha-Jharlang-Sertung-Tipling road section, which will make mobility easier in various regions of the district, previously not connected to the road network.
People living in remote areas of the district, which are not linked with road networks, have to walk at least three days to reach the district headquarters.

Following the court’s diktat that Giri be presented along with the investigation file, police had reached out to Biratnagar-based Birat Nursing Home to collect Giri, who had managed to spend the entire 25-day custody granted by the court for investigation in the hospital, before taking him to the court in an ambulance.
Sunsari police Spokesperson DSP Binod Sharma, citing the court, said trial hearing into the case would start tomorrow. Meanwhile, the audio of telephone conversation between Giri and his followers levelling the rape charge against him that Giri has claimed as fake, has been tested, essentially establishing the male voice on the audio was Giri’s.

Regarding the case, legal eagles have pointed out the possibility of Giri being kept in judicial custody or released on normal date or bail.
Today, getting the information about the self-styled godman being presented at the court today, some women had gathered on the court premises in a show of support for him.

Local sugarcane farmers looked sad as Shreeram Sugar Mills was yet to come into operation at Garuda in Rautahat.
The then prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala had inaugurated the sugar mills in 1992 at Garuda and it was in operation for the last 27 years. The mill has been crushing sugarcane since then.
The management has taken no initiative to repair the mills though repair works have taken place every September or October. Sugarcane farmers looked sad after there was no preparation for operation of the mill till date.
According to an internal source, the sugar mill might be on the verge of closure as it has faced huge loss in the past 16 years. He said the management did not like operating the mill at a loss. He added that some 400 staffers would be jobless if the mill was closed. Reportedly, the mill owed some 40 crore rupees to sugarcane farmers from the last fiscal.
Sanjaya Mishra, a local sugarcane farmer, said farmers were confused as the mill had yet to issue any notice. Locals said the mill was making profit till 2003 when Golchha organisation ran it.
The mill’s decline can be attributed to the unfortunate associations with sugarcane production union and the staff in the mill. The locals questioned what would
happen to sugarcane farming in thousands of hectare land if the mill did not come into operation.
District Chairman of Sugarcane Production Union Ashok Yadav said he was in contact with the authority concerned to release the due amount to the farmers. He added initiatives were taken for operation of the mill.

Chairman of the Public Service Commission Umesh Mainali and a PSC member, Ashok Kumar Jha, said they were upset by the arguments made against the autonomy of PSC in the State Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, where the bill to amend and integrate Public Service Commission is being discussed.
Mainali said the phraseology used in the bill did not ensure financial autonomy which the PSC hitherto enjoyed. “If we exceed the budget ceiling, it may be right to argue that we need to seek approval from the government. But why can’t we spend money from the available budget without seeking the government’s permission?” he wondered.
Mainali said the constitution treated PSC as an autonomous body on par with other autonomous bodies, such as National Human Rights Commission, Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority and Auditor General’s Office.
“Certain expenditures made by constitutional bodies should be non-votable items and the same should happen in the matters of our expenditure,” Mainali said.
Jha said financial autonomy was vital for PSC as it was going to introduce modern and comprehensive programmes to conduct written examination and interviews for civil service job aspirants.
He said the PSC wanted to use Assessment Centre Methodology to select civil servants for which it would need huge resources. “We need to go for ACM to select best suited personnel for government jobs because existing methods of selecting government personnel are not up to the mark,” Jha said. He added that some people were trying to dissuade the stakeholders from going for ACM.
PSC has used a few components of ACM in the selection of a few under-secretaries and joint-secretaries and in the National Investigation Department. ACM includes simulation and psychological tests. “PSC wants to record interviews and other examination which hitherto have not been recorded. Once we record the presentation of the interviewee, we can submit the record to the court when an issue is raised questioning fairness and neutrality of the interviewers,” he added.
Mainali said lawmakers discussing the PSC bill must ensure that the PSC enjoyed administrative autonomy too. “The government needs to ensure that civil servants who work in sensitive departments of PSC are not transferred without PSC’s permission,” Mainali said. He added that if all the personnel working in sensitive departments were transferred, then the PSC could not do its job.
PSC’s permission before transferring employees is a must because it takes months to do certain technical jobs. “If any technical employee is transferred without PSC’s permission, then the constitutional body will have to spend months training a new employee again,” Jha said.

As the process of electing a new speaker of the House of Representatives begins tomorrow, Nepal Communist Party (NCP) leader and former speaker Subas Nembang is the front-runner to become the next leader of the House, while the Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal is likely to bag the post of deputy speaker, multiple sources claimed.
According to sources, the election for the two posts will take place on Monday, while nominations will be filed on Sunday. The meeting of the HoR tomorrow will announce the date for the election, as per the agenda for tomorrow’s HoR meeting. The speaker’s post has been vacant since Krishna Bahadur Mahara was arrested on the attempt-to-rape charge.
Incumbent Deputy Speaker Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, who represents the NCP, is expected to tender her resignation tomorrow, according to sources, since the ruling party cannot stake claim for both the posts as per the constitutional provision that speaker and deputy speaker shall represent different parties.
Tumbahamphe, who has also staked claim for the speaker’s post, however, told THT that she had not yet decided on her resignation and that the party should first decide. “I have not been consulted by the party leadership on the matter,” she said.
Since the NCP leadership has said it will not give up the post of speaker even as it has to forego the deputy speaker’s post, Tumbahamphe’s resignation is a must for the NCP to contest the election. Even if Tumbahamphe is to be elected speaker, she must resign to be eligible to file her nomination.
Despite the constitutional provision, the NCP had kept the posts of speaker and deputy speaker on the ground that Mahara (from former CPN-MC) and Tumbahamphe (from former CPN-UML) belonged to different parties at the time of their appointment. The two parties later merged to form the NCP.
Although NCP Co-chairs KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal have not yet taken a decision on the new speaker, they are of the view that an experienced person, of the likes of Nembang, is needed to lead the House in the present context, according to sources.
“While Nembang has been Oli’s favourite from the beginning, the decision has been delayed because Dahal is under pressure get a former CPN-MC leader elected the speaker,” the source said. “But Nembang is the clear front-runner.”
Mahara and Tumbahamphe were elected on the basis of seat sharing among former CPN-MC and CPN-UML. As per the understanding, the former CPN-MC bagged the posts of HoR speaker and National Assembly deputy chairperson, while the former CPN-UML got NA chairperson and HoR deputy speaker.
As far as the post of deputy speaker is concerned, the RJP-N will get the post as part of a broader understanding reached between the RJP-N and the NCP when the two agreed to cooperate for the upcoming election of the National Assembly slated for January 23, the sources said.

During a fresher’s event, organised by the All Nepal National Free Students Union (ANNFSU) at Prithvi Narayan Campus, Pokhara, on Thursday, leader Nepal said the present government, moving in the path of socialism, need to introduce programmes focused on the marginalised population of the country.

Ministers, parliamentarians, and local level representatives should work towards fulfilling the aspirations of people with honesty, said Nepal. “Do not misuse the power of your position.”
Nepal said NCP (NCP) is close to a two-thirds majority and there is a need to retain more seats in the next elections. “We are people’s choice. The party has come a long way from 2047 BS to 2074 BS. Out of the seven provinces, six have NCP (NCP)-led government and we hold majority seats in about 450 local levels out of 753.”
The party lost its two-thirds majority status with the withdrawal of Samajwadi Party-Nepal from the ruling-coalition on Tuesday after Co-chairperson of the party and Deputy Prime Minister Upendra Yadav tendered his resignation to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli citing government’s reluctance to honour a previously forged consensus on constitution amendment as the reason.
“There will be many who will try to bring down the government despite good work. Therefore, it is crucial to preserve positivity and move ahead,” Nepal said. Giving the example of leaders around the world who brought about change following Marxism, leader Nepal encouraged the students of the college to become responsible leaders and work for the country’s betterment once they are ready.

Similar is the case of Lalita Thapa, an employee working in the health department of the municipality. Thapa has a son who is six months old and she too carries out her official duties alongside taking care of the child.
Deputy mayor of Badimalika Municipality, Kabita Bista, said it is difficult for women employees and women service seekers as the municipality office does not have a child care centre and breastfeeding room. She added, acknowledging the situation, that a care centre and room for breastfeeding would soon be managed at the office to facilitate new mothers who juggle numerous tasks at home and work.
Women rights activist Rukmani Shah stated that such challenges faced by women have made a direct impact on their development and empowerment. “Due to multiple tasks and shortage of time, women have been facing barriers such as not being able to complete their education, lack of participation in capacity building, missed opportunities in getting jobs that would improve their economic situation, having to work in tedious and risky areas, among others.”
It is vital that the state takes responsibility to develop infrastructures and facilities to ease the work-load of women — who have diverse and multi-faceted roles to play — in order to utilise their skills and bring them into mainstream development.

Three ward chairs today padlocked the Office of Rajgadh Rural Municipality, Saptari, expressing dissatisfaction with the working style of the rural municipality chair and its executive.
Ward chairs Lalit Narayan Singh of Rajgadh-2, Hemnarayan Sah of Ward No 4 and Kamaldev Yadav of Ward No 6 padlocked the office of the rural municipality.
Ward Chair Yadav said that they had padlocked the rural municipality office as the office and its chair had conducted most of the activities going against the law and had discriminated in terms of development works.
“All local people of the ward are equal for people’s representatives. But, the rural municipality chair is working with political prejudice. We appealed saying that everyday work be regulated, but, our request was flatly rejected,” Ward Chair Yadav added.
Ward chair Yadav said that they were forced to lock the rural municipality office as Rajgadh Rural Municipality Chair Parmanand Yadav had ignored their requests over and over again.
The rural municipality chair is elected from Nepali Congress. Ward Chair Singh is from Samajwadi Party-Nepal while other the ward chairs Sah and Yadav are from the ruling Nepal Communist party (NCP) and Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal respectively.
Ward chair Sah said that they had submitted a 14-point memorandum to the rural municipality chair. “We locked the rural municipality office to make our point to the public after the rural municipality chair bypassed our request to make the rural municipality’s work transparent and effective,” Sah added.
The memorandum comprises various points including discriminatory behaviour meted out to the wards, concealing the rural municipality’s decisions and not notifying about the executive’s meeting to all the members of the executive.

276,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-threat-of-pneumonia/,"Taking preventive measures is the best way to keep children below 15 years of age free from influenza and pneumonia 
Doctors have advised parents to take care of their children, especially those below 15 years of age, during the winter season as it provides the most favourable condition for the speedy growth of virus/ bacteria that may lead to viral influenza and pneumonia. With the mercury dropping every day, chances of catching viral influenza and pneumonia are very high because of a higher level of moisture in the air during the winter. The cold wave in the Tarai and chilly environment in the hilly and mountainous regions in the morning and evening have led to higher cases of viral influenza and pneumonia, especially among the children and elderly people. The cold wave in the southern plains has thrown normal life out of gear, forcing the people to stay put inside their homes and burning firewood to ward off the bone-chilling cold. The yearly phenomenon will continue to remain unchanged for a couple of weeks to come. The Kathmandu Valley is more prone to pneumonia because of air pollution caused by dust and smoke belched out by vehicles and brick kilns. The dust and smoke hang over just above the ground in the morning, making it most risky to venture out at that time. Recurrence of pneumonia among the children between two months and 15 years of age with a history of two or more episodes of pneumonia is very high.
In a study conducted by Dr Prashant Rijal and his team at the Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital on 653 patients of the hospital from July 2013 to June 2018, 74 of them were diagnosed with recurrent pneumonia. It means, on an average, one in nine children with pneumonia has recurrent pneumonia. Air pollution, overcrowding, malnutrition, congenital anomalies, congenital immune deficiency, gastroesophageal reflux, lack of vaccine and babies who are not breastfed are some of the reasons for the recurrence of pneumonia among the children. Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection caused either by virus, bacteria or fungi that affects the lungs. After suffering from pneumonia, air sacs in the lungs are filled with fluid, making it difficult to breath.
Doctors have advised all to take preventive measures to keep their children free from the cold-related disease. Breastfeeding, proper vaccination, keeping children away from the cold, pollution and timely treatment are the best preventive measures. As the disease spreads via air-borne droplets from cough and sneezing, children are more prone to contact the infection at school. Early recognition of pneumonia and management of its causes are the best way to reduce the mortality rate related to pneumonia. According to a World Life Expectancy survey, influenza and pneumonia deaths in Nepal reached 10,535, or 6.45 per cent of the total deaths in 2017. Influenza and pneumonia claimed the lives of 47 persons out of every 100,000 people in 2017. According to WHO, pneumonia accounted for 15 per cent of all deaths of children under five years in 2017. Early diagnosis and care are necessary for children suffering from pneumonia. Immediate medical help is needed if a child suffers from fever, cough and common cold, has difficulty in breathing and has developed a sore throat. Prevention is always better than cure.

Bizarre story
In what is a bizarre incident, seven persons have been arrested for abducting a Nepali model and trying to sell her to a religious cult in India for a sacrifice. The model must thank her stars and the Nepal Police that intervened just in time to save her life. Nepali women and girls have been trafficked to India and beyond mostly to be sold into the flesh trade, but the latest incident involving a model for a human sacrifice reads like a plot out of Indian cinema. The police are investigating the case, and should it turn out that the model was being trafficked for a religious sacrifice, then it should make everyone sit up and contemplate the gravity of the issue.
Nepal and India share an open border, and thousands of people from either side cross the largely unregulated border every day. This makes it easy for unscrupulous people to traffic unsuspecting Nepali women and children across the border for different purposes. If religious cults are indeed looking for humans to make sacrifices, then children who disappear without a trace should be a matter of worry to the parents. This calls for stronger vigilance by the community, parents and the police to keep our society safe.

In 2019, an estimated 1.26 million people were exposed to flood risks during the monsoon season. While there had been many devastating floods in the recent years, —from the 2008 Koshi River flooding to this year’s monsoon flooding in which 200,000 people were affected — the phenomenon has always been a fairly cyclical, consistent occurrence.
The consequences of flooding are as varied as they are serious: families lose homes, crops and livestock. Road blockages prevent markets from functioning properly, and building damage compromises safe, productive activity. Those most affected are invariably the most vulnerable or socially marginalised groups, and food stock loss, hygiene and sanitation problems combine to exacerbate existing food insecurity issues.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
The government has been working on flooding preparedness and early warning to mitigate the impact of floods on communities. One example of this is the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology’s early warning messages, which are sent out in the hours preceding rapid flooding, allowing families enough time to react. Another innovative idea that has emerged in recent years is Forecast-based Financing (FbF).
FbF is an innovative mechanism whereby early actions at the community and government level are pre-planned based on credible forecasts, and are funded and implemented before a climate shock. Its goal is to anticipate disasters, prevent or mitigate their impact, if possible, and reduce human suffering and losses.
FbF at its core turns traditional humanitarian response on its head—instead of focussing on assistance after a flood, support is given to communities ex-ante. Reliable triggers for assistance are set based on risk analyses and weather forecasts, and anticipatory actions — from evacuation to prepositioning of food and relief items – are taken in the days and hours before the disaster hits.
Championed by the likes of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the German Red Cross and the World Food Programme (WFP), FbF came into widespread practice only in the last few years. It has been applied in humanitarian response ranging from floods in Bangladesh, to hurricanes in the Caribbean, to drought in Niger.
This concept, applied to floods, has been firmly backed by the Nepal government, and reflected in its National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy of 2018. Through this initiative, tools to monitor and forecast a variety of hazards are to be linked with early warning systems and early government actions.
As an implementing agency of FbF, WFP has been supporting the government in improving the quality of forecasts to better predict floods and their impacts through the creation of new hydrodynamic models. The next step is to understand household vulnerability, and to this end, WFP and the Nepal Red Cross Society have been collecting household data in 11 Tarai districts and ranked them on a risk index. This allows Palika governments to direct their efforts towards the households and communities that need assistance the most.
Equally important to the FbF approach is outlining the anticipatory actions that governments and partners can take against reliable forecasts. WFP has worked with 19 Tarai district governments to design standard operating procedures that spell out various anticipatory actions to take at different lead times, including evacuation of at-risk populations, activation of early emergency protocols, and preparation of assistance for at-risk or affected communities.
Other actors, including the Nepal Red Cross Society, the Danish Red Cross and Practical Action, are also starting to incorporate a forecast-based, anticipation-based approach to disasters.
An international dialogue platform in Berlin, and three additional regional Dialogue Platforms held in Africa, Asia and Latin America with partners creates every year an exchange between participants on ways to improve Forecast-based Financing, and best implement the concept into existing
projects and advance the use of weather and climate data.
FbF is gaining increased attention in Nepal. On November 28, the Ministry of Home Affairs hosted the first-ever National Dialogue Platform for Forecast-based Financing and Anticipatory Humanitarian Action in Kathmandu. The National Dialogue Platform, which comes on the heels of a similar global event held two weeks prior, brought together government at all levels, practitioners and donors and served as a space to exchange ideas and practices.
As a result of the Platform, a clear community of practice is being formed among key government, NGO, UN and civil society partners based on a common vision on how anticipatory actions can best support the people of Nepal in becoming more risk-informed and shock-resilient.
As climate change drives more extreme weather events eveywhere, countries like Nepal are broadening the humanitarian toolbox to ensure that the right support gets to those most in need, at the right time. Forecast-based financing is an exciting step in this direction.

278,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/mind-it-to-mend-it/,"The thrusting action behind every action is a persuasive longing to doing better. This uplifting idea works on that vibrant, enriching loop called conscious principle. The result — a vigorous urge to become unequivocally useful to oneself and also others.
There are decent folks around us, yet — some of them with abundant individual, or bespoke, aptitudes and qualities. It is their profuse strength of mind and mindfulness that places them at the ‘controls.’ They achieve because they envision and decrypt what they distinguish into action. When you are in their circle, or company, you are also elevated to a higher stratum of conscious attentiveness.
This whole progression plays a fundamental role in the preservation of our health and well-being primarily because any change in our consciousness brings with it somatic, emotional and mental implications. From worthy attitude, positivity, harmony, self-confidence, success and fulfilment to distraction, skewed thinking, anxiety and tummy distress, aside from disorders like hypertension. This prompts a surfeit of surging ancillary effects, too — good and bad. The resultant outcome of the latter is obvious — a disruption in our activity pattern, or movement of energy. When this process occurs on a protracted footing, it leads to not just compromised living, but also existence.
This is why the whole process of re-establishment of health and wellness, in prolonged illness, may often take a long time. The consequence is extended therapy, including its inevitable spin-offs — despair, vexation and ‘drug-centric’ side-effects. The best thing that any of us could do is making a constant and determined effort towards optimal health, while heeding to our body signals and improving the intensity of our conscious responsiveness.
In other words, we should learn to disengage ourselves from our constant contemplations and anxieties. But this isn’t easy. The best thing we’d all do is: use our intuitive, observant and intellectual mind with better judgment, foresight and insight. This will allow us to disentangle ourselves from our artificial attitudes or responses. It also helps us to realise ourselves as spiritual entities — not just corporeal, earthly objects with mind, body, spirit, or soul. The rest is predictable — when our sense of self-consciousness swells, it lifts us to a higher form of consciousness. Call it spiritual, or cosmic, mindfulness — or, what you may.

279,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-fruit-of-federalism/,"Local governments must improve their spending capacity and administrative skills so that all the local units can generate more resources for themselves
It’s taken quite some time, but the fruit of federalism is starting to trickle down to the local levels, namely the rural and urban municipalities. For the first time, the government has distributed royalty collected last fiscal from the use of four natural resources – mountains, rives, forests and mines – at the local level. Although the government should have disbursed the royalty a month after the end of the last fiscal, or mid-August, it was able to do so only last week because of the confusion over how to do it. The biggest beneficiary has been Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, home to the world’s tallest peak, Mt. Everest. It raked in Rs 115 million, which is understandable, given that the 8,848-m peak commands a royalty of $11,000 from each foreign climber. Other major recipients generated royalty mostly from the use of their rivers for the construction of hydropower projects. The government distributed Rs 1.4 billion in royalty to 576 of the 753 local units, or 76.5 per cent.
In line with the federal set up, the central government keeps half of the total royalty generated at the local level, while distributing 25 per cent to the seven provinces and the remaining 25 per cent to the local units. Thus the federal government retained Rs 2.9 billion in royalty collected from the use of natural resources. The way the local levels generate resources shows that not all are equally advantaged. Some local units have more natural resources than others, or even if one is naturally endowed, it might not be in a position to exploit them. So how will those local levels that received no royalty or received very little be compensated by the federal government? The disparity in royalty income could invite conflict among the local units and with the centre.
Of course, the local governments also enjoy four types of fiscal transfers. The equalisation grants are transfers of resources to the provincial and local governments based on population and development status. The conditional grants are funds meant for implementing projects related to national policies and standards. Matching grants are transfer of funds to complement the resources of the local level for a project while special grants support a special project related to the supply of services, emergency needs and activities of national priority. Add to these VAT and internal excise tax revenues as well as royalty that are shared among the federal, provincial and local governments. On top of these, the local governments will also collect local taxes on property and rent, and vehicle registration fees where feasible. So even without the royalty, the funds that are transferred to the local levels are quite substantial. The spending responsibilities now lie with the local governments, allowing them to plan the expenditure as per the needs of the locals. But they have shown limited implementation capacity to fully utilise their resources. Hence, the local governments will need to improve their spending capacity and administrative skills so that all the local units can generate more resources for themselves, including royalty, so as to lessen their dependence on the central government’s largesse.

A welcome move
In a major development, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) on Tuesday issued a three-point circular to all the District Administration Offices (DAOs) of Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces directing them to take strong legal action against those forcing or practising chhaupadi. The DAOs were told to form a mechanism to act tough against the worst form of gender-based violence. Chhaupadi, which is widely practised in the provinces, is a punishable crime.
The ministry’s circular is a welcome move, which will help eliminate the superstition and taboos associated with menstruation, which is a normal biological process that also helps purify women’s blood. The circular says those who practise and encourage chhaupadi will be deprived of social security allowances and facility of subsidised loans, while members of a family who banish girls and women during their period will be deprived of senior citizen allowance and other social security schemes. The MoHA has also told the DAOs to destroy the chhau sheds. If these measures are well implemented at the grass-roots level, the age-old practice in the provinces will come to an end. Though the Supreme Court ruled that chhaupadi was illegal in 2005, it is still widely prevalent there.

280,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/future-of-maize-introduce-hybrid-varieties/,"Since the area under maize cannot be expanded and developing new farm technologies can be expensive, productivity gaps across regions and among farmer groups can be narrowed more quickly using available technologies
When you buy popcorn in a movie theater, maize cobs from a street vendor and a meal which comes from processing maize as feed, we should be thankful to the farmers. They are men and women who battle against the unpredictable weather and invasive insects and bring food from the field to our fork. I have been hearing that agriculture is the government’s priority since I was a child. The 6th five-year plan (1980-1985) focussed on attaining food self-sufficiently in the hills, including maize, but still there is not much progress. Productivity of maize, the main cereal crop after rice and a promising cash crop, started increasing slowly and constantly after 1985. From 1.5 tons per hectare in 1985, productivity reached 1.6 tons in 1990/91 and 2.6 tons in 2018/19.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
A recently released statistical information by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MoALD) shows that maize is grown on 954,000 hectares (25% of the total area of cereals), which was 758,000 ha in 1985.
In three decades of efforts, productivity has increased by around 1% every year. However, the overall demand for maize is expected to grow by 4-6% every year for the next 20 years. The major hindrance to growing more is an inefficient production system.
Maize is being used for feed, food, fuel and fibre. The increasing demand for maize comes from the growing need for poultry feed. Some 80% of maize consumption in Nepal is due to poultry and animal feed. The domestic production can meet only 30% of current demand. India exported 5 million tons of feed and maize seeds to Nepal in 2018/19.
Nepali farmers face problems of quality seed and fertiliser availability and a market for their produce. Besides, the reason for an inefficient production system is inadequate scientific and technological knowledge among the maize farming communities. Majority of the farmers still sow the local varieties not by preference, but due to the unavailability of quality seeds and lack of technical knowledge of hybrid maize production.
Nepal has developed and released 29 open-pollinated (improved through selection and traditional plant breeding method) and five hybrids (developed through cross-pollination) maize varieties. To date, nearly all hybrid seeds are imported.
The bulk of maize grown areas (80.6%) lies in the hills and mountains, but their productivity is less than the national average.
So, is not the production and distribution of maize hybrid seeds by the National Maize Research Programme or extension mechanism of MoALD a failure? MoALD, Nepal Agriculture Research Council and PM’s Agricultural Modernisation Programme are the government’s three wings for maize development.
But they lack coordination among themselves. The government has a long history of top-down decision-making and very low participation of the local people in influencing policy decisions. It has instituted a wide range of policies and targets, where the recently announced target is to double agricultural production within the next five years (2018-2023). The question is, will it be achieved?
Not only doom and bloom but many interesting trends are emerging, and there are many opportunities lying to be tapped. For example, we could include winter maize under the rice-wheat system to reduce its import.
This requires less water compared to the usual rain-fed maize growing areas in summer. With the rise of the decentralised governance structure, each local government can have its agricultural policies based on local needs.
The government is promoting the collective farming model in agriculture through cooperatives, and farmers can take advantage of irrigation, agro-inputs, insurance, mechanisation and technological services. A few farmers from Chitwan and Kaski districts are already using this model.
Since the area under maize cannot be expanded and developing new farm technologies is expensive, productivity gaps across regions and among farmer groups can be narrowed more quickly using available technologies and extension services.
For this, dissemination of scientific research findings, including the best management practices in local languages, among farmers will be pivotal.
Farmers should also be encouraged to visit on-farm research trials on improved open-pollinated and hybrid varieties to motivate them to introduce similar practices in their fields. Research run by International Business Machines Corporation and Walmart on moving the process of food block chain from production to consumer level can be tracked in 2.2 seconds, which typically took seven days to trace the source of food in the past. We could develop similar technologies to track the supply chain of seed, fertiliser and maize products in the Nepali market and beyond.
Apps related to maize crop calendar, weather forecast, diagnosis of insect-pest, disease, nutrient deficiency from a photo (submitted by the farmer) can be developed. In fact, some of these apps are under testing and verification phases.
Approaches based on information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be harnessed as a cost-effective way to reach farmers and help in Nepal’s food security. And let’s bring in the youths as technological innovators and agri-preneurs in maize production.

In what appears to be one of the biggest raids, Nepal Police arrested as many as 122 Chinese nationals from various parts of the capital on Monday on suspicion of their involvement in illegal activities, cyber and financial crimes. Tipped off by the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu, they were rounded up from Manamaiju, Bansbari and Budhanilkantha areas between 1:00 pm and 7:00 pm. Police have also seized around 500 laptops and more than 150 mobile phones from their rented apartments. Police believe they were indulging in illegal activities, such as cyber and financial crimes. “Urgent arrest warrants” were issued by the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police in coordination with the Metropolitan Crime Division-Teku, Metropolitan Police Range-Ranipokhari and the police headquarters. Earlier, the Chinese Embassy had written a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the entry of those Chinese people from the Philippines, Cambodia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The Foreign Ministry had immediately forwarded the letter to the Home Ministry, which instructed the police headquarters to take action. They are learnt to have fled the said countries after the governments started cracking down on them for indulging in hacking the banking systems there and in China. Preliminary investigation shows that all of the arrested had entered Nepal on a tourist or student visa.
The Kathmandu District Court will now decide whether to free or detain them for a few more days. Such a large number of Chinese nationals have been detained in a single day four months after six Chinese nationals were arrested in connection with the country’s biggest cyber heist in the banking sector, from where they had stolen at least Rs 35.8 million from the ATMs in Nepal and India. The police are yet to establish whether the new arrests have any connection with the old ones. The way they had rented the apartments at very high prices and used special identity cards to enter there shows they had bigger plans to commit cyber, financial crimes and engage in other illegal activities.
In recent times, Nepal has become a lucrative place to engage in cyber and financial crimes for international racketeers, who are taking advantage of the country’s security lapses. Despite Nepal Rasta Bank’s repeated notifications to the banks and financial institutions to upgrade their security system, they have not adhered to the instructions. Strong vigilance, especially at major tourist hubs, is a must to control cyber crimes, smuggling and drug trafficking. The law enforcement agency must make sure that no foreigner on a tourist or a student visa is involved in non-tourist activities. Others who overstay their visa should be booked and legal action taken against them. We also need to further strengthen mutual cooperation with our friendly countries when it comes to dealing with criminal activities. Their arrest would not have been possible without cooperation from China. At a press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry official confirmed the arrest of the Chinese nationals in Nepal. The official also confirmed that the action was taken under mutual cooperation between the two countries.

Inhumane behaviour
There was a time when buffaloes were made to trek hundreds of miles from the Tarai plains to the Kathmandu Valley before being slaughtered for meat. They no longer walk, but the conditions under which they are transported in trucks from one place to another are simply harsh. The Supreme Court, following its verdict on February 11 on a writ petition demanding the government prohibit people from transporting domesticated animals and birds in an inhumane and cruel manner, had directed the government to enact the Animal Welfare Act. However, animals continue to be transported for more than eight hours without food in crammed trucks, with the government remaining a mute spectator.
It must be difficult for the government to implement the legal provision on animals, knowing fully well how even humans must fare in our overcrowded public vehicles. The inhumane way of transporting animals is only half the story, the savagery with which they are slaughtered deserves even greater attention. If we are to live in a civilised world, we must look after the welfare of not only humans but also that of animals. The sooner the government acts, the sooner it will help ease the pangs of the animals.

The role of women in society has been varying throughout the time frame. Earlier, women stood as respectable makers of the home – serving as a wife, mother and mother-in-law. They found their values and respect within their positions inside home. However, in recent times, an extra role of women as a working member of society has been added. In fact, women have reached high positions, which once were considered too far out for them. Women have been presidents and prime ministers of nations, respectable doctors, lawyers, professors, analysts and everything that used to be solely under male ordinance.
While it is impressive that women have been earning and bearing the financial burden of the family along with their responsibilities as a wife and mother, this fact that women in full-time employment is an added perk besides being a homemaker is a highly ignored truth. In other words, women are being bullied by the society for fulfilling their actual and core role – a homemaker. We see a lot of examples these days that if an educated married woman is not working outside and serving her husband and rearing her kids, she is highly looked down upon. She attracts terms like ‘non-working’ and ‘husband-dependent’ despite her noble, full-time job as somebody who is ‘building’ a home, community and ‘uplifting’ individuals like her husband and kids.

Sunila has been working in a school as a full-time teacher since the last six years. Four years ago, she got married, and soon after she became a mom. Being married to someone who is constantly based outside the valley and living all by themselves in a nuclear family was not an easy task for her. She made up her mind to be a stay-at-home mom and take care of her newborn until the child entered school. However, the opposition she faced from her circle of friends and family members to keep working made her reluctant to do so. She got programmed in her mind that these few years of her life are her productive years, and she should not tamper with her career and so on. Hence, she continued working for a not-so-sophisticated income just for the sake of her ‘career’, leaving her eight-month-old in a day care centre. The real problem appeared when the child would fall ill and she was forced to take several days off. All the mental stress, moments of loneliness and burnout involved behind the scene are a whole new story.
Babita has been a full-time homemaker since the time she got married. She has raised a seven- year-old and looks after the academic, social and moral needs of her child, being an educated woman. However, she has not stopped being criticised and tormented with words like ‘unmotivated’ and ‘comfort-loving’ by the people in her circle. She explains how words like those hit her self-esteem and sometimes feel like going back to work, but restrains herself because she is the only one who can identify the ways she is investing upon her child.
As commercial as today’s world has become, practically everything is weighed in terms of monetary value. It is important, however, to acknowledge that during the generative phase of adulthood, parents must address and invest in the physical, mental, social, emotional and cognitive needs of their child. Even a mere presence of one of the parents with them during the growing years can have a lasting positive impact on the proper development of the child. But being overindulgent in long duty hours and being stressed out after the working hours, not being able to invest time and words in the child can lead to a lack of belongingness and love in him/her.
The result is evident. Emotional issues like anxiety and depression, social issues like rebellion, degrading sense of respect and identity crises are at an alarmingly higher level among today’s youth, more than ever in history. If someone asks what a full-time homemaker can do, we can show them that she actually builds up an individual. Not to forget that an individual is the building block of society and nation. This simple fact, not being displayed in many societies today has caused them to be doomed.
Does it mean that women should not work outside at all? Of course not!  She should, but not at the cost of the well-being of her family, for whom she is like a cornerstone. Women in ancient days had societal roles. But their societal roles were not glorified over their roles as a wife and mother. Unlike today, their identity was not based on what and how they were performing outside or how much they were earning. A greater theme of women empowerment is to give her the freedom to be productive inside and outside her home, not pressurising her to a point that she would suffer a burnout in her important roles that are instrumental for the well-being of society.
I know a lot of moms who regret their decisions to be overindulgent in work that their children couldn’t achieve their potential in emotional, mental, cognitive and social grounds. On the contrary, there are those happy moms who find fulfillment in shaping their children as stable, honoured and fruitful members of society. That must be an awesome feeling! Hats off to all the women who are working hard to address the financial needs of their family! Also hats off to all the wonderful women who have made up their minds to prepare and nurture the family being a ‘Happy Homemaker.’

284,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/effects-of-solar-eclipse-on-eyes/,"In view of the solar eclipse on the new moon day of December 26, this article aims to enlighten the facts and debunk a few misconceptions. The partial eclipse will be seen from parts of Kathmandu, starting at 8:43 am and end at 11:31 am, with the peak at 10:01 am.
For the first time, in the 18th century, evidence was found about the harmful effects on the eye caused by watching a solar eclipse. The effect depends upon the amount of radiation and exposure to it. The effects are caused due to the heat induced photo-chemical process.
The ultra-violet rays affect the skin (red blisters or carcinogenic effects), its heat affects the retina and incites many other problems. The partial solar eclipse can be viewed with the naked eyes only for a few seconds, but a total solar eclipse—to be seen on August 21—is never safe to watch with the naked eyes.
Even when 99 per cent of the sun is covered by the moon, it is not safe to watch it without precautionary measures. This is because the harmful rays coming from the remaining 1 per cent of the sun especially affects the cornea of our eyes.
A black spot in the middle of the visual field shall always remain due to the permanent and irreversible damage to the centre of the retina. Why is it more harmful to watch the sun during a solar eclipse than at any other time? During an eclipse, the sun is blocked by the moon, and there is darkness all around for a while.
At this time, the pupil of our eye is dilated, and suddenly when some portion of the sun becomes visible, many harmful rays enter our eyes that even penetrate parts of the retina. On a normal day, the sun is so bright that we cannot look at it.
Similarly, at the time of the eclipse, the earth, the moon and the sun fall on the same plane in a straight line, causing the gravitational pull of each of the celestial bodies to combine. As a result, harmful rays, which would otherwise scatter in any other direction in space, are streamlined to precipitate onto the Earth. Radons are among those harmful rays, which can easily set in damp or wet materials for some time. So, there are scientific grounds for the old belief that water and food items exposed to the eclipse should not be consumed.
It is best not to watch a solar eclipse. It is heard on the grapevine that looking through a medical x-ray film, photo negatives or polarising spectacles saves eyes from those harmful rays, which is not true.

285,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/earthquake-reconstruction-challenge-to-save-social-aura/,"The government-approved house map for the quake-hit areas should be designed by analysing the socio-cultural and geographical context. Following the Gorkha quake, people decided on RCC construction because they thought it was safer
Nepal is multi-hazardous country, and the government has been implementing a National Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Act since 2018 in line with the global plan of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2018-2030. The impact of climate change has been directly and indirectly seen in the country, with reoccurrences of mini-typhoons, drought, heavy rains, extreme heat and thunderbolt. Similarly, Nepal was witness to a strong earthquake in 2015.
Earthquake reconstruction is running in its fifth year. Retrofitting and new construction have been rapidly moving ahead. With federalism in place, the local authority has taken up the major responsibility of earthquake reconstruction. Proper implementation of earthquake-resistant construction practices and their institutionalisation are a burning issue in the quake-hit districts.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
The data of the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) show that almost 62 per cent of housing construction has been completed till now. According to the Post Disaster Need Assessment (PDNA) report, more than 850,000 residential buildings, 5,000 schools and 1,000 health facilities were damaged in the Gorkha Earthquake-2015. In addition, government and public buildings were also damaged on a massive scale. NRA has a plan to complete and achieve the targeted goal of reconstruction by January 2020.
Supporting the mission of the government are numerous I/NGOs in different districts. The government has provided a housing grant of $3,000 to each affected family, which has still not been taken by all those entitled due to socio-cultural difficulties and challenges faced in housing construction. There is difficulty in managing construction materials and workers in housing construction while lack of trained technical manpower is another challenge. The approval of housing design is highly complex for particular target groups as the nation’s geographical and socio-cultural diversity demands diversity in construction design and approach.
RCC construction is the current mode of construction, which is expensive and costly for the people of the rural areas. Also, the procurement, transportation of construction materials and workmanship make housing construction expensive. The overall construction or maintenance cost is high, and the subsidy doesn’t cover even 50 percent of the cost. In the hilly and mountainous districts, transportation of construction materials is difficult during the monsoon, and there is water scarcity for construction in the winter season. So the use of local materials is far better than adopting modern construction materials and technology.
Hence, user-friendly or community-friendly designs are a must for rural reconstruction. A few settlements and communities are building houses to fulfill the reconstruction ritual. Such buildings have one or two rooms, making it difficult to meet the needs of a family.
On the other hand, high-rise apartments are coming up in the semi-urban and urban settlements. These constructions clearly exceed the height recommended in the country’s seismic building code, underlining the challenge of enforcing implementation. There is a clear gap between the haves and have nots, which is impacting the reconstruction process and progress. The government has been implementing the Building Code since 2003, but is still facing difficulty in implementing it in the field, so necessary to reduce the disaster risks.
Earlier construction practices of Nepal were unique in architecture. The traditional roofing, artistic wooden frame and design were typical. They were geographically and socio-culturally friendly but vanished in the post-earthquake reconstruction. The straw and stone slate roofing has given way to concrete construction, in which Nepali originality and socio-cultural diversity have been lost. Thus, the traditional aura in a building has been lost. From the eyes of social science or sociological perspective, this is a critical issue that has been raised in earthquake reconstruction.
Therefore, the government has to frame a strategy to use local materials rather than the RCC model for housing construction. The government-approved house map for the quake-hit areas should be designed by analysing the socio-cultural and geographical context. Following the Gorkha Earthquake, the beneficiaries decided on RCC construction because they thought it was safer than masonry work. But senior engineers and DRR experts claim that masonry buildings can easily resist an earthquake just like the RCC. Certainly, our ancestors designed and constructed buildings that were geographically and socio-culturally-friendly, which were beautiful, environment-friendly and healthy to live in. Therefore, the Himal, Tarai and Hilly regions have their unique types of construction practices, and the local authority has to take the lead in protecting the local cultural diversity.
In the post-quake reconstruction, entire settlements have migrated to the urban areas or cities of concrete. Interestingly, the government is planning 2020 as tourism year, but the originality of settlements is being lost day by day. Therefore, to maintain the aura, originality and glory of a community, citizens must share some responsibility, and the local authority has to develop a certain code for housing construction and land plotting.

286,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/discrimination-in-sports/,"The 13th edition of the South Asian Games (SAG) has completed successfully. Deepest gratitude to all the medalists, officials and team managers for handing over the highest number of medals ever in the SAG for Nepal. Multiple countries have been congratulating Nepal for its new record, and we sportspersons too are extremely glad of this achievement.
Indeed, this time, athletes contributed a lot for the SAG. Now, in return, it is the responsibility of the government to improve the sports sector. It has announced to honour the gold medalists with a   cash prize of Rs 9 lakhs, but the point is, how long will an athlete run with this amount of money? Until and unless all the three tiers of government (central, provincial and local level) work with a vision to improve the sports sector, our Nepali athletes will not be able to bag medals in the Asian Games and Olympics.
What did the government do in honour of the medalists? A city rally! But for an athlete, who toils day and night and fights to make the motherland proud, their victory should not be confined only to a cash honour and a city round.
If the nation really wants to develop sports, it should treat it as a mission. A motivating environment must be built in the nation by erecting quality sports infrastructure and facilities, otherwise it will hard to retain good sportspersons.
In respect to the historic win in the SAG, the government has honored the medalists with some cash prizes but has discriminated against the international judges, who played an important role in the successful completion of this SAG. In the 13th SAG, the organisers had accommodated all the guest judges from different countries well, but we international judges of the host country experienced the worst management in terms of accommodation and food. It’s a pity that we international judges have always been forced to use our own pocket money for referee seminars, refresher training and license renewals every year.
While the medalists were honoured with cash for their achievement, the international judges saw their allowance cut off by almost 50 per cent.
Such a frame of mind will not help motivate the officials to contribute their best for the upcoming events. It is extremely painful to see the misuse of power and politicisation of the Nepali sports sector. While our neighbouring countries allocate heavily to sports, Nepal spends just 0.015 per cent of the total budget on it.

287,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-wrong-treatment/,"One fails to understand why the attending doctors did not refer the child to some other hospital for better expert advice
Nepal is not new to reports about doctors’ negligence and errors in the treatment of patients, leading to complications, death or disability for life. Medical treatment in a private hospital in Nepal is very expensive, but still people opt for it, with the belief that money will cure them of their disease and agony. But time and again, even prestigious hospitals are in the news for giving the wrong medication and lengthening the stay of the patients unnecessarily. Nepal Medical Council (NMC) has just concluded that the doctors of Kathmandu-based Grande International Hospital committed three mistakes in the treatment of the child born of Sanjeev Neupane and Ekta Ghimire, which led to one complication after another, with the child, now 18 months old, fighting for his life. The incident is just one of a series of inaccurate diagnoses and wrong treatments that the hospital has been blamed for in recent times. The NMC has noted that Neupane and Ghimire’s child had been given an overdose of paracetamol while there was a misunderstanding between the radiologist and neurosurgeons on the size of the excess cerebrospinal fluid that had built up in the brain. The NMC committee has also pointed out that a CT scan or MRI had been delayed against the advice of the radiologist.
All in all, five surgeries of the head and months of stay in the expensive hospital have cost the parents millions of rupees in treatment costs, while being little informed about the treatment procedures. The mistakes committed by the hospital and doctors go against the medical code of conduct, which requires a doctor to be God like in his ability, knowledge and demeanour, but human in caring for his patients. In the decision letters given to the hospital and doctors, the NMC has asked the paediatrician involved in the treatment of the child be kept in probation period of one week under the supervision of an expert, while the neurosurgeon has been given a last warning. It must be really traumatic for the parents to be looking after their child, knowing fully well that he will never regain his health.
The NMC is not in a position to dictate if the hospital should pay compensation to the victim’s family for the medical misadventure. And even if the hospital were to pay, no amount of financial reparation is going to compensate for the trauma caused to the parents and their child. To prevent such bitter occurrences in the future, it is only right that the doctors should take the medical code of ethics to heart. In the above incident, it is clear that the standard care procedures were not followed, which amounts to medical negligence. As the NMC has noted, no humanitarian concern had been shown even when the health condition of the baby was critical. One fails to understand why the attending doctors did not refer the child to some other hospital for better expert advice instead of experimenting with one treatment after another, which continued for months. Medical service has now become something like a consumer good, where the patients are the consumers and medical personnel, the service providers. So, patients will seek delivery of quality medical service, especially if they have paid good money for it.

Protect public land
The tendency of encroaching on public land belonging to forest or public institutions is on the rise due to the government’s inaction. Minister for Land Management and Cooperatives Padma Aryal the other day said over 13,000 bighas of land had been captured by individuals across the country. This is a serious case, and the government must take strong action against those occupying public land.
A report from Banke states that 76 families had been occupying over three bighas of land belonging to Adarsha Secondary School in Nepalgunj Sub-Metropolis-20 for many years. The houses and sheds built over there were demolished with the help of the local administration only after a complaint was lodged against the encroachers with Hello Sarkar. The land was registered in the school’s name some 40 years ago. But the encroachers, who claim to be landless squatters, have vowed to recapture it. The land should be used for educational purpose only, and the school management needs to protect its land by putting up fences around it. As far as the squatters’ problem is concerned, the government should find an alternative to resettle them elsewhere along with the provision of jobs available at the local levels.

288,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-clear-the-confusions/,"Given the huge volume of grant assistance the US is providing under the MCC, Nepal can ill afford to lose it for her development
Even as the government is all set to endorse the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Nepal Compact Programme by the Federal Parliament during the ongoing winter session, a new debate has now surfaced whether the US assistance is a part of the broader Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) put forth by the US. The US is providing US$ 500 million to Nepal under the grant assistance for the construction of high voltage transmission lines and upgradation of the existing strategic roads to give a boost to the national economy. Then finance minister Gyanendra Bahadur Kakri had signed the deal in Washington on September 14, 2017, well before the USA came up with the IPS – an economic, good governance and military and defense cooperation pact among the member states in the Indo-Pacific region. Nepal will also have to contribute US$ 130 million as matching fund to the MCC. The differences of opinion regarding the MCC surfaced during the weeklong standing committee meeting of the ruling Nepal Communist Party. Some of the NCP members claimed that it was a part of the IPS while Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali insisted that it was not, as the MCC was envisaged in 2004 while the IPS came into being only in 2017. NCP Co-Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal said that the MCC could be taken for implementation only after the US clarified that it is not a part of the IPS.
Some of the clauses in the MCC are contentious. The MCC agreement demands endorsement from the Federal Parliament whereas constitutional experts believe it is not necessary to have it passed through the Parliament. Article 7 (7.1), for example, states that after the said agreement comes into force, it shall prevail in case it contradicts Nepal’s law. Likewise, Article 3 (3.8 a) requires auditing of the MCC project be carried out only by a US firm. Since Nepal is also putting in money to the project, Nepal’s Office of the Auditor’s General should also have the right to carry out the project’s auditing. Likewise, Article 5 (5.1 a and b) states that the US government can terminate the deal at any time by giving a written notification to Nepal. But Nepal cannot do so. These are some of the controversial clauses that need to be rectified before Nepal’s Parliament endorses it.
Foreign Minister Gyawali is insisting that the MCC should not be looked at from the IPS perspectives. Some of the countries in Europe, Central Asia, West Africa and Latin America have also joined the MCC in the same manner as Nepal and Sri Lanka have done. As the dispute has already surfaced, both the US and Nepal must sit together and sort out the differences. It shows there are some lapses that should be resolved before it comes into implementation. On the other hand, the US government also needs to clarify the doubts raised about the MCC. As a non-aligned country, Nepal has clearly stated that it cannot be a part of any military alliance. However, given the huge volume of grant assistance that the US is providing, Nepal can ill afford to lose it as it will help overall development of the country, especially in the energy sector and better road connectivity. With the grant assistance, Nepal will also acquire new technology and management skills. The MCC must take off for the mutual interests of both the countries.

Retaining students
The school enrollment campaign might be a success, but retaining the students until they complete secondary school is proving to be a challenge, with children dropping out mid-way, especially those coming from the Dalit communities. This has been the case of children from the Musahar and Bantar communities in the Tarai district of Mahottari. Enrolling and retaining have been particularly difficult in the case of the girl child. Having a provision for free education in the new constitution is not enough to improve learning among the Dalit and poor children if they do not see any value in attending school.
There are many reasons why children drop out of school, and they are not limited to illiteracy among the parents and poverty at home. The attitude of the teachers towards the Dalit children could be a prime factor. Given the family environment back home, such children need extra attention and encouragement if they are to perform at par with their better-off classmates. Mid-day meals for the poor students could be an incentive to attend school. In the later years, a vocational skill will prove much more productive than studying subjects students will never make use of in their life.

Letter to the Editor
Clarification by MCA-Nepal
Our organisation’s attention has been drawn towards an editorial published in your reputed news daily on December 23 entitled “Clear the confusions” that had some factual inaccuracies with regard to the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact clauses.
Firstly, the editorial mentions MCC agreement demands endorsement from the Federal Parliament whereas constitutional experts believe it is not necessary to have it passed through the Parliament. The truth is the Government of Nepal decided to send it for Parliamentary ratification after a well-thought legal opinion and thorough consideration by the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. Additionally, all MCC Compacts worldwide are implemented only after a Parliamentary ratification.
Secondly, it mentions that Article 3 (3.8 a) requires auditing of the MCC project to be carried out only by a US firm. This is totally false. The last sentence of the same article states that the Auditor General of Nepal can audit it at any given time. Also, the Formation Order issued by the Government of Nepal clearly mentions in Section 11 that MCA-Nepal will be audited by the Auditor General of Nepal.
Thirdly, it mentions that Article 5 (5.1 a and b) states that the US government can terminate the deal at any time by giving a written notification to Nepal. But Nepal cannot do so. This is highly untrue. The same article also states that either party can terminate the Compact without cause by giving 30 days’ prior written notice.
MCA-Nepal, established under Nepal’s own legislative process, entrusted with and committed to delivering the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact, requests a reputed daily such as yours to report to the public the above facts with due diligence.

As a tiger range country, Nepal is considered both a source and a transit point
The very image of a tiger creates a feeling of fear and respect for the majestic animal. It has no known predator and is at the top of the food chain. Conservationists often refer to the tiger as a “keystone” or “flagship” species. A healthy tiger population indicates the good health of the related ecosystem along with a good prey base and habitat for the wild animals it preys on. It is said the big cat needs 200-250 kilos of flesh a week to sustain. The Royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) found in Nepal’s lowland forests, northern India, Bhutan and Bangladesh is one of the five remaining species of tiger found in the world today.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Following the eradication of malaria in the country in the late 1950s, there was large-scale migration of the hill people to the fertile lands of the southern plains. In the ensuing years and decades, there was unchecked deforestation for agricultural and infrastructure development. A rapidly growing human population coupled with subsistence agricultural practices not only degraded the prime tiger habitat there but also relegated the dwindled tiger population to the confines of wildlife sanctuaries.
Despite the subsequent conservation measures, this magnificent animal is highly endangered and is still faced with the threat of extinction. Elsewhere, Balinese and Caspian tigers are already extinct, whereas the Javan tiger is believed to have disappeared in the 1980s.
The major challenges of tiger conservation include habitat loss due to burgeoning human population, poaching and illegal trade in its body parts. Conflict between the local inhabitants and wildlife occurs when herbivores damage crops in the adjoining field or tigers kill their domestic animals.
Despite the legal provision of a hefty fine or a prison sentence (or both) for killing a tiger as well as a compensation scheme for crop or livestock damage, affected locals sometimes resort to retaliatory killings. Tigers are elusive and avoid humans.
Unfortunately, sometimes human life is lost in a tragic encounter between the two. There is a compensation scheme for the loss of life or injuries sustained in a tiger attack.
Increasing international demand for tiger skin and bone has fuelled the illegal trade in its body parts, thereby threatening the long-term survival of this endangered wildlife. Tiger bone is used in some oriental traditional medicine for its so-called aphrodisiac properties.
Being one of the tiger range countries, Nepal is considered both a source (country) and a transit point. Nepal’s legislation regards wildlife crime as an organised crime and prohibits trade in tiger parts in and out of the country.
Despite the minimisation of poaching and illegal trade in tiger parts, opportunistic poaching still remains a problem. In the past decade, 49 tiger skins and 204 kilos of tiger bones were seized, while 2,258 people were arrested for their involvement in wildlife-related crime.
As long as there is a demand for tiger parts in consumer countries, Nepal will face the threat of tiger poaching.
The first tiger conservation initiative can be traced back to 1972, when the government, WWF-US and the Smithsonian Institute jointly launched the Tiger Ecology Project in Chitwan. The early conservation emphasis was on species preservation and adherence to strict law enforcement practices.  Apart from the park-people conflict on the fringe of the forested areas, the lesson learned over the years was that a more conciliatory approach was needed to win the support of the local people for the long-term survival of this marvel of nature, now confined to the island-like national parks.
Nepal’s commitment to tiger conservation is eventually yielding results. The tiger count conducted in 2018 has recorded 235 tigers in the wild. The earlier census of 2009 had recorded 121 individuals. The result shows the country is close to doubling its tiger population and achieving the global commitment made at the 2010 St. Petersburg Summit in Russia.
WWF Nepal has joined hands and worked with the Government of Nepal (GoN) for over two decades in creating awareness and opportunities of sources of local livelihood, community forestry in the degraded patches of forests, and anti poaching. Community involvement in conservation is showing positive signs as Nepal has witnessed zero-poaching (of rhinoceros) year several times.
Jointly launched by GoN and WWF in 2001, the Tarai Arc Landscape (TAL) Programme aims to secure a larger area for tiger conservation by building connectivity between adjacent protected areas and forests within the country as well as between the forests of the trans-border areas of Nepal and India, with biological corridors to facilitate dispersal of this endangered species. Mega terrestrial wildlife such as the wild Asian elephant and the Greater one-horned rhinoceros have been sighted in the corridor forests. Moreover, tiger movement has been recorded in the Khata corridor, which provides connectivity between Nepal’s Bardia National Park and the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary of India.
Experts say national effort alone will not be enough to deal with the nexus of illegal dealers in international trade in tiger parts and that tiger range countries need to meet regularly to address this thorny issue. Nepal has already initiated talks on the matter with neighbouring countries.

290,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/embarrassing-moment/,"This was Ken’s fifth consecutive annual visit to India from his native land, the United Kingdom. But unlike his previous four visits, this time he had brought Joe, his friend, along. Ken was a retired military man who enjoyed trotting the globe.
“I have had a close brush with the cultures and cuisines of almost all nations, but I am smitten with India’s rich cultural heritage,” said Ken when I was introduced to him by the principal of our college. I was assigned the lovely job of interpreter for both the guests during their stay with us. While having interactions with them in the queen’s tongue, I was not only enthusiastic but also marvelled at their profound curiosity to dig deeper into our cultural mines.
Ken’s inquisitiveness was quite inspiring, questioning me about all the famous places of Amritsar that we all visited together. A sense of deep piety overwhelmed Ken and Joe when I expounded on the glorious religious history of The Golden Temple. But the bloody well and the chest-piercing bullet marks at Jaliyah Wala Bhag welled up tears in their eyes.
They were perhaps experiencing a sort of remorse within for what their countrymen had done to our citizens when we were a colony of the British. But I was more inclined to know what tempted these foreign birds of exotic wings to fly to India over and over again.
Though Joe was just a fun-grabber wanting to have a first-hand experience of the Indian ways of life, for Ken it was his quest for spirituality that had brought him to India on several occasions. Ken had developed a close connect with some great Indian mystics also. He had come to practise esoteric oriental meditation under their tutelage. Playing a good host and offering them our cuisines and cultural bonanza brought a heightened sense of joy and pride to me.
But these feelings were short-lived. I had to hang my head in shame when my foreign friends enquired about the gruesome rape of a doctor from Hyderabad (Telengana). Here my skills in speech failed me badly.
In a bid to end my embarrassment, they deliberately changed the course of their conversation to the marvellous Indian culture again. But I was still unable to compose myself. What messages were we Indians spreading across the world? Was our country now getting transformed from a rich land of spirituality to the land of sexual perversity? I was no more able to have eye contact with my foreign guests.

Many people living in a metropolitan city may have at least one story to tell about having gone through such discomfort in a closed public space. While some of such stories fade away with time and are eventually forgotten, others remain ingrained in a person’s memory- sometimes resurfacing, voluntarily suppressed the next moment.
People, mostly women, face various levels of sexual harassment in public transportation which are rarely expressed and even if they are little or nothing is done about it. Incidents involving a person violating another’s personal space and freedom to travel with peace of mind has become more frequent than it should.
Many such incidents ‘pass’ without much noise or notice given that public transports are crowded and with many unknown faces overfilling the cramped spaces. The discomfort and embarrassment, however, lingers on. The embarrassment which should have been felt by the perpetrator hits the wrong end. The withdrawal happens in a bid to avoid the attention of the crowd because we have for long been taught that even if we have been wronged, the shame is ours.
I was returning home from work one fine evening, standing by the bus window at the end space and the bus gradually became crowded. A while later, a girl quickly shifted towards me to stand by the window too. Behind her stood a man in a pale shirt. Only later did I realise that the man, who reeked of alcohol, had his eyes fixed on the girl and was advancing towards her.
I, with the girl, shifted away. However, that man who had every intention to sexually harass us advanced towards us. I told another passenger about what was going on. By then, the culprit had moved a bit further and shifted his gaze to another woman. The other guy that I sought help from asked this woman to stand in another corner and she obliged. All eyes were on the harasser who then moved towards the bus door hesitantly.
Such perpetrators will act upon their needs, on their terms, without being at all concerned about anything else. And the victim in their hesitation will find themselves in a mental conflict about how to react. As witnesses, what we can at least try to do is consider what the victim would expect of us, or how we, if the roles were reversed, would expect others around us to act.
This is just one representative case and there are countless such cases. Such jarring incidents, which continue to occur frequently despite many debates and measures around the issue, make us question – when will a woman start feeling safe?
The aforementioned incident wherein people showed support to the intended-target of abuse may be viewed as one with a positive outcome. However, women do not always receive such support.
A woman, who wishes to remain unnamed, also a mother of two, shared how she had once witnessed harassment inside public transportation as a man laid his hands on her friend. She said her companion acted aggressively in response and the man spoke back indecently while no other passenger bothered to speak out in her favour.
Another woman, a regular traveller by bus, shared a similar story. “These things happen especially while you’re standing in a crowded bus when men standing behind you try to push you from behind while you can perceive their intention without an inch of doubt.” She added, “You ache to speak out or push back but instead end up doing nothing and wait for the congestion in the bus to loosen.”
Other common but not as widely discussed issue that women face while using public transport is manspreading.
Courtesy: Wikipedia
Manspreading, a term which was initially coined by women on online forums expressing dissent over a peculiar habit exhibited by men, has now been formalised by Oxford Dictionary.
The dictionary defines manspreading as the practice in which a man, especially on public transportation, takes a sitting position with his legs wide apart, in such a way as to encroach on an adjacent seat(s).
A man may not even realise the way he is seated or how it is bothering someone else. But a woman or any other passenger sitting next to a ‘manspreader’ will be discomforted by such clumsiness.
It is always best to speak out, react to inappropriate behaviour – whether molestation or manspreading – so that such behaviour doesn’t go unchecked.
However, that is easier said than done. A victim under such circumstances may find it difficult to react for various reasons, the most common reason being the fear of being misunderstood. In case a woman retaliates and demands some space, the other person takes it on their ego.
During one such incident where a woman asked for some space when a man got too close, things escalated to an extent where an elderly man came in defence of the fellow male passenger and pulled a satire that men and women should travel by different buses altogether.
The viability of such a scenario is certainly questionable on the ground of possibility. But shouldn’t there be a better way to tackle the situation where respect for fellow travellers comes naturally without being asked for?
Because basic civic sense is not so common, responsible state mechanisms could perhaps formulate regulations to protect commuters from sexual harassment in public transportation.
A decade or so ago, women and girls would not have spoken out for their reserved seat(s) in public transportation. But now, especially after the campaign to enforce the provision of reserved seats on public vehicles stated by the Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act, 2049 BS (1993 AD), the scenario has changed. It has to some extent safeguarded women and girls from the perpetrators of abuse.
There’s more that can be done. The solution lies inside the human mind and within human sensibility. The solution is multi-dimensional. Everyone has a role to play and a sentiment to understand. The main idea is to be open that it could happen to anyone and what we as individuals can do is speak out.

292,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/qr-code-payments-for-financial-inclusion/,"Having QR doesn’t just make payments simple, secure and affordable but also helps the government in generating more taxes, contributing to economic prosperity. To acquire QR code payments, a PAN number and bank account are required
With innovation in the payment systems in Nepal, people are shifting gears from cash to digital payments. Cash remains the king, as 97 per cent of the transactions are done through it; however, digital transactions are on the rise. Digital payments are faster and hassle-free. Digital payments are not just limited to card payments through Point of Sales (PoS) machines these days even in Nepal. People have started scanning QR through their smartphones, businesses have integrated the innovative payment system, and this is on the rise.

Quick Response (QR) code payments are an alternative to cash or debit/credit card payments. It is a contactless payment that is done by scanning the QR code using any mobile banking application, or digital wallet, which is part of the network. This avoids the use of expensive point of sale machines and cards. The customer can simply enter the required amount, remarks and PIN. In a few taps, the payment is done.
“I’ve been transacting through my mobile banking application and digital wallet in restaurants, department stores, and even petrol pumps. In less than 30 seconds my payment is done, and I don’t feel the need to carry loads of cash since these services have been introduced,” shares a customer. Moreover, with QR codes, there is no need to swipe a card as well. People have started saving money with its use as most QR merchants provide discounts and offers with every transaction.
Under the Fonepay network, there are 60,000 plus merchants throughout the nation, and 20,000 transactions take place every day. Around 300,000- 400,000 users are paying through the network daily. Restaurants in the city, such as Trishara, Dalle and Bota, provide attractive offers to customers who use QR systems to make payments. In businesses, such as Tranquility Spa, QR payments have surpassed the traditional card payments. QR payments offer up to 50 per cent discount.
“One in every four transactions is done through QR, and the customer flow has significantly increased after introducing QR payment offers,” says Rajesh Phaiju, administrator at Tranquility Spa.
QR code payments have reached across Nepal, covering the remote areas in the Himalaya, hills and Tarai. QR code payments have been acquired by small and medium-scale businesses in the nooks and crannies of the country. Okhaldhunga’s Gyan Katuwal, owner of Ganga Bijaya Wholesale Kirana Pasal, installed QR code payments a few months back. He shares that people are gradually shifting towards digital payments in the region. According to him, “QR code payments are quite easy to maintain and use. I do not have to install, maintain and operate a PoS machine.”
Similarly, Krishna Sharan Lama, the owner of White House View Point Restaurant, Dakshinkali has installed a QR payment system. “My restaurant is quite packed during the weekends, and many customers have inquired about QR payments,” he said. “So, I felt the urgency to integrate it into my business.” Since he started using these services, his customer’s needs for contactless payments have been met.
QR payments have also been accepted in social functions, such as weddings, and also at temples. When I recently visited Tal Barahi Temple in Pokhara, I observed that even it has started accepting QR payments, even Gods have started going digital in a way. I installed my QR code during my wedding reception, which made it possible for the guests to scan my QR and directly send cash to my account. This saved me from taking all the cash out of the envelope, counting them and depositing it into my account. Moreover, it is also a secure option as there is always a risk of losing cash during the rush of a traditional Nepali wedding.
However, acquisition of QR code payment systems doesn’t mean that people will use it right away. People have to be educated about how and why using QR payments are necessary. Having QR doesn’t just make payments simple, secure and affordable but also aids the government in generating more taxes. Now, this has a multiplier effect and contributes to economic prosperity. A Permanent Account Number (PAN) and bank account are required to acquire QR code payments for a business. This promotes financial inclusion, access and transparency. Our neighboring country, China, has adopted QR code payments religiously, even mom and pop stores, vegetable vendors, transport rental services use this technology to accept payments.
Moreover, even artists performing in the streets do not accept cash, instead they have their QR payment codes to accept payments. When someone makes payments using cash, they get odd stares in the streets of China. Some 92 per cent of people in China’s top cities used We Chat Pay or Alipay as their primary payment method as per Penguin Intelligence in 2017.
We can learn a lesson from the factory of the world, China, and promote digital payments through QR code payments in Nepal. Since we now have 8.4 million mobile banking subscribers, and it is increasing rapidly, this facilitates QR code payments. Moreover, digital wallets also facilitate these payments. The government must play a proactive role in enabling digital payments to enable transparency, financial inclusion, financial access and economic prosperity in the long run.

293,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-restore-services-soon/,"Removing the cables only after providing an alternative access to phone and internet services would have saved trouble for everyone
Bundles and bundles of wires and cables seen dangling from utility poles spaced every few metres in the streets of Kathmandu are an eyesore. They are a blot on the otherwise charming cityscape dotted with age-old temples and monuments framed against the snow-peaked mountains. In a bid to give the city a neater look, Kathmandu Metropolitan City is shaving off loops of wires and cables of landline telephone and internet services at different places of the capital. While the initiative to improve the city’s image is definitely welcome, one cannot rule out the disruption of telephone and internet services, which greatly inconveniences the locals. This is particularly so if the work is being carried out at a place where businesses are heavily concentrated, such as Thamel in the heart of the capital. The tourist hub is home to 6,000 businesses, ranging from hotels and restaurants to souvenir shops and massage parlours, and one can well imagine what any disruption in communication services does to their business.
It’s been more than four days since the Thamel Tourism Development Council (TTDC) launched the drive to make the tourist hub cleaner by removing the ugly wire and cable mesh. What it did not foresee was the problem this could cause to the local businesses. And the timing could not have been more inappropriate. The initiative was begun targeting the Visit Nepal Year 2020, which starts in less than two weeks, but Christmas and the New Year are also just round the corner when Thamel sees a lot of visitors, and the business volume goes up. Today’s tourists don’t carry much cash and all transactions are settled through digital payments, either with a debit and credit card or through Quick Response (QR) code payments. But to swipe the payment cards in a point of sales machine requires landline phone service. Hotels are  also having to face the wrath of their guests who are unable to communicate with their family members back home. The hotels as well as tour agencies are also unable to keep tab of online bookings and speak to their clients. With landline and internet service out of order already for days, the loss to businesses in Thamel could be staggering.
It is not known when the phone and internet services will be restored. There are speculations that it might take upto 10 days just to cut the wires. In today’s world, can any individual or business survive that long without communication services? The TTDC should have foreseen the problem and made arrangements so as not to disturb the local business environment. The TTDC has claimed it had held discussion with the stakeholders, including the businesses, Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the regulatory body, and internet service providers. However, the Internet Service Providers’ Association of Nepal has asserted it was not informed about the campaign, which shows lack of coordination among the different stakeholders. Removing the cables only after providing an alternative access to phone and internet services would have saved trouble for everyone. But the campaign to remove the dangling wires cannot be stopped midway now, and the only way to restore the communication links quickly is by speeding up the pace of work.

Rotavirus vaccine
The government is launching rotavirus vaccination for children below five years of age from June next year. Rotavirus is the most common cause of diarrhoea among children across the world. It is one of the most common illnesses among children and the major cause of childhood mortality in Nepal.
The vaccination prevents diarrhoea among children below five years of age. It will help reduce the death of children from diarrhoea, doctors at the Child Health and Immunisation Section at Family Welfare Division say. The government aims to vaccinate around 620,000 children against rotavirus in the first phase. The first dose of the vaccine should be given to a child when s/he is six months old and the next dose in ten months. It will be available in 16,000 health posts of the country. Prevalence of diarrhoea among children below five is eight per cent while six per cent below six months suffered from it. Nepal Health Sector Strategy 2016-21 targets are to reduce neonatal and under-five mortality to 17.5 and 28 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2021. The SDG targets related to neonatal and under-five mortality rate in Nepal are to reduce them to 12 and 20 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030.

294,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/message-of-south-asian-games/,"When nations are estranged from one another based on ideology, geography, nationality and religion, the magic power that brings this divided world together is international sports events, be they the World Cup, Olympics Games or South Asian Games. These events are usually organised for the purposes of maintaining fitness, enhancing relationships, humanity, brotherhood and equality among nations and people. While offering a platform for nations to display their skills, abilities and contributions in the field of sports, it also promotes unity, solidarity, cooperation, peace and harmony among nations.
Last week, the entire nation was in the grip of the thrilling 13th edition of the South Asian Games (SAG) held in Nepal. The 10-day SAG fair had created ample excitement, fun and enthusiasm among the people. Even though there were some grievances over the poor, incomplete and shoddy preparations, the entire event went on to become a grand success. With Nepal winning an unprecedented 206 medals, including a rich haul of 51 gold medals to finish second in the medal tally, the success was historic.
However, it is distressing to note that poor promotion of the SAG had kept many people away from the competitions; women footballers were forced to play at the Pokhara Stadium, which did not have a dressing room; and vital preparations were being carried out till the last minute in the capital. Although the authorities had three years to complete the preparations for the SAG, the sluggishness with which they were being carried out till the final hours sent a bad message. It is sad to learn that due to lack of proper sporting equipment and gear, some Nepali players had to compete by borrowing them from fellow competitors. The ability to bring together even countries having bitter relations onto the same platform was praiseworthy, but the failure to have them participate in all the games, especially major ones like football and cricket, was a major weakness.
The recent awards and cash incentives declared by the prime minister to the medal-winners in the SAG are really an encouraging and welcome step, but this alone will not develop sports in the long run. There must be a concrete vision, policies, enough budget and an effective implementation plan to assure the coveted progress in sports. The government should take steps to build stadiums and other sports facilities in each of the seven states.

295,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-saving-daughters/,"Karnali Province deserves praise for initiating the bold step to save daughters, an idea never thought out by the Centre
Just like what the government of Province-2 did last year to protect daughters through “Save Daughters, Educate Daughters” campaign, the government of Karnali Province has also taken a bold step to protect daughters through the “Bank Account for Daughters, Lifelong Security Programme,” which came into force from Tuesday. Karnali Province is the most backward mountainous region, where life expectancy is far below the national average of around 69 years, and the condition of women there is especially harsh. Karnali Province Chief Minister Mahendra Bahadur Shahi launched the programme by handing over cheques of Rs 1,000 each to four-month-old and two-month-old daughters born to two dalit women to open bank accounts in their names in Kalikot’s Khandachakra Municipality-1 and 2. Initiating the scheme, the chief minister said it was a ‘special one geared towards ensuring social justice for daughters’. Under the first tranche, the provincial government has handed over Rs 38.4 million to the local levels to open bank accounts in the names of newborn daughters. The social security programme was launched after completing the necessary procedures for opening the bank accounts for newborn daughters. It will be implemented in all the districts of the province.
According to the procedure, it will be applicable for baby girls born from the start of the current fiscal. Families wanting to join the scheme are required to apply to the concerned local levels by submitting necessary documents. It, however, will be applicable only for the first two daughters born to the same parents. In the case of girls without parents and raised by others, there is no limit about the number of girls entitled to the facility. Besides opening the bank accounts as an initial fund for newborn daughters, the provincial government will also contribute Rs 500 to their accounts every month. The local levels will release the fund into their accounts till they reach 20 years of age. The accumulated amount thus saved is expected to reach around Rs 200,000 in twenty years. The money provided by the government cannot be withdrawn until the girl attains 20 years of age.
However, there are some riders for withdrawing the money. The parents must provide up to secondary level education to their daughters, and they cannot marry till they cross 20 years of age to claim the fund. The main objectives behind launching this scheme are to bring an end to selective abortion, gender-based violence, child marriage and to encourage the parents to send their daughters to school. This will also help get rid of the old notion of the families that daughters are a social and financial liability. This programme will also help the provincial government develop its own human capital, an indigenous idea never thought out by the federal government. The impact of the scheme will be visible in society within the next couple of years. It will certainly help bring an end to the prevailing chhuapdi pratha that has disparaged the lives of menstruating women in the province. A new generation of women will come forward to do away with the age-old practice as they will become financially strong and educationally conscious. Karnali Province deserves praise for taking the bold step.

Cold wave
A cold thick fog has enveloped the eight Tarai districts of Province 2, pushing the mercury down and throwing life out of gear for the residents across the state. Schools have closed, visibility is down, people can’t go to work, and there are few people in the market place. The cold wave is actually a blanket of thick fog and smoke, and it affects everyone, young and old, students and workers. But children and the elderly tend to suffer more as they cannot take proper care of themselves. The health of the residents is of particular concern, with a sudden increase in the cases of common cold, pneumonia, diarrhoea and asthma. The best safeguard against the biting cold is to stay warm by staying indoors, wearing warm clothes or sitting around a fire.
Although a cold wave is expected in the Tarai around the middle of December and lasts for a month, it is necessary to remind the people to take all the necessary precautions to lessen its impact on their lives. In the last three years, the cold wave has claimed the lives of 46 people, mostly in the Tarai districts. With good preparation, human casualties could be avoided this time.

Two media posts were emotionally disturbing for me today. One was on Facebook: A photo of a little baby-girl who missed her parents (rather the whole family) in a terrible bus accident that took place in Sindhupalchowk. The other one was from an online news portal: Deadly statistics regarding recurring road traffic accidents (RTA) in Nepal. For example: 230 people have died due to the RTAs in just 28 days. Just two weeks ago (November 28), a bus accident in Arghakhanchi killed 19 people. Five days later (December 3), 14 died in a Jeep accident in Baglung. During the four-week period, 1,426 people were injured.
In just five months (mid-August to mid-December) this year, there have been 7,505 road accidents, killing 1,030 people, around 100 of them children.  If we go through last year’s statistics, on average, seven deaths and 40 injuries are taking place every day due to RTA alone. With the loss of so many productive lives, many more disabilities and massive burden on the dependent family members, I consider these RTAs a form of a recurring massacre.
Recent WHO data (2017) reveal that 3 per cent of all deaths in Nepal are due to RTA. Nepal ranks 79th in the world for RTA-related deaths. Among the SAARC countries, Nepal lies towards the higher side of RTA-related deaths. As per the 2017 data, RTA is the 11th leading cause of death in Nepal, following serious diseases related to the heart and lungs, TB, diarrhea, diabetes, pneumonia and the like. Is this not tragic? In the Kathmandu Valley alone, more than 5,500 RTAs happen every year, with more than 3 per cent leading to deaths.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Why are these tragedies recurring in our country? RTAs are multi-factorial in origin. We can divide the possible causative factors as: a) rider or driver-related; b) vehicle-related; c) environment and road-related; d) other factors like weather and pedestrians. Over-speeding, negligence, lack of rest, lack of proper training, alcohol or drug abuse, disabilities and diseases, lacking education are some of the driver-related issues. Most motorbike accidents in Kathmandu are due to adolescent riders with high thrill-seeking and low harm-avoidance traits. Such personality traits lead to rule avoidance or defiant tendencies. Aggression, hostility, negative attitude towards the government and laws, inappropriate social needs and unhealthy lifestyles may be additional psychosocial factors requiring consideration. These are very important aspects as 70-80 per cent of accidents are said to be associated with human factors, which are usually avoidable.
Mechanical or technical failures or deficiencies, old and poorly-maintained buses and trucks, overloading are some of the vehicle-associated factors. Lack of proper servicing of engines contributes to brake-failure or vehicular collapse. As per 2016 data, 2.5 million vehicles are registered in Nepal and ply on 26,900 km of roads. Half of those vehicles operate in the Kathmandu Valley alone.
Nepali roads are considered to be the most dangerous. Chances of RTAs on these roads are found to be 100 times more than in Japan, and 10 times more than in India. Steep terrain in the hills, snowy mountains and slippery roads after the rains make them accident-prone, particularly in winter and the monsoon. Poor condition of the roads, even in the capital city, with open manholes and rain-damaged structures are an additional nuisance. Lack of traffic lights and poor visibility in the evenings due to absence of street-lights when vehicular speed is uncontrollable make RTAs common during weekends and festival seasons, as reported in a study from western Nepal. Weather conditions are beyond human control. Other factors like unthinking pedestrians and wandering cattle and dogs are also contributory factors to the recurring RTAs.
As the cause is multi-factorial, so is the prevention strategy. There should be a holistic approach. A mass media campaign to change the public attitude on road-safety is necessary. Driving institutes should have an elaborate curriculum regarding traffic rules and road-safety. These institutes should be ranked according to the performance of the drivers trained by them. Safe drivers should be provided suitable incentives. Tax-exemption may be considered for them. Similarly, unsafe/ drunken drivers need proper punishment. Psychological evaluation of drivers (particularly those involved in public transport or night buses) should be made mandatory before providing them the license. Thorough records of their age, marital status and family details should be maintained.
We have examples of the positive effects of the anti-drunk driving rule (so-called mapase) in our country. School curriculum should also incorporate road-safety measures and traffic-injury prevention strategies. Hospitals should enforce trauma-registries. The government should have efficient programmes and sufficient budget not only for developing road networks, but also for road-maintenance, ro-ad-safety and disaster prevention. Unless proper policies are imposed, RTAs will continue to grow and recur, leading to more casualties, loss of life and disabilities among the survivors. Mental health consequences like grief reactions, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, cannot be overlooked in this situation.

297,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/baby-shower-in-nepali-culture/,"To my knowledge, a baby shower is a ceremony in which an expectant mother is showered with gifts that will be useful for the baby. Different cultures have different ways of marking it. This ceremony is widely celebrated in the western world.
Go back to the Vedic Ages, a similar event, known as Seemantha, existed, during which the mother-to-be was showered with dry fruits and various sweets for the well-being of the baby’s physical and mental development. Baby showers may have been a western norm for centuries. However, Seemantha has existed in our culture since time immemorial, but we are ignorant about how it might have flourished all over the world and may seem to us this is not something we have been celebrating in our society.
Last month, we had thrown a baby shower for the mom-to-be. We had invited dozens of people, and it was indeed a great time for everyone at our house at Macleod, Australia. To me, having to celebrate the aforementioned event looked like being a cultural copycat of the West, if I may say so. Therefore, I was thinking whether it would be rational to celebrate the baby shower at my residence. Honestly speaking, I did not celebrate it to be happy with myself, but, more conscientiously, I did not want my baby to remain an exception to the tradition when she grows up. To me, throwing a baby shower makes you feel as if you are making headway to becoming a responsible parent, who is always living up to the family’s expectations and desires. It certainly paves the road to parenthood and brings you to its preliminary stage of how you will go about dealing with the moral challenges when it comes to facing the ground reality of being a father in the first place.
This is the moment of my life when I try to tackle the moral dilemmas and the mixed feelings that are rampantly rooted in my mind’s cells. Life has always been tumultuous and choppy in its own right. We are the ones who need to smoothly sail through this arduous journey with an immense level
of patience and perseverance so as to be able to manage
the family’s needs and expectations.
I am beginning to learn to trim my time on social media and perhaps on other futile activities. It is always great to give quality time to your family, especially when you are having kids. Finally, I am making headway toward becoming a responsible father in the days to come.

298,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-ensure-privacy-right/,"It would be in the interest of the government not to push the bill through the Parliament on the strength of its near two-thirds majority
Like some of the previous bills registered in the Parliament, a new bill is likely to stir up a hornet’s nest as it runs counter to the people’s right to privacy. The Bill to Amend and Integrate Laws related to the Constitution and Operation of Nepal Special Service provides sweeping powers to the National Investigation Department (NID) to monitor the communications of any person or organisation that the government suspects is spying against the state or working against public interest. The bill was tabled by the government at the Federal Parliament recently for discussion. The Right to Privacy Act was enacted last year, and it allows an investigating agency to collect private data on individuals only with the permission of a court. What the bill under discussion in the Parliament does is it overrides the provisions mentioned in the Act and gives NID direct authority to monitor and intercept digital exchange of information of individuals without a court’s approval. Article 28 of the Constitution has declared the right to privacy and protection of information as a fundamental right, and no state institution has the right to encroach on it.
The Nepali Congress has come down heavily on the Operation of Special Service bill while drawing flak from human rights lawyers and the civil society. This points to the fact that the bill has been tabled without holding greater consultation with the stakeholders – the opposition, civil society and human rights activists. The NC Parliamentary Office says the provisions in the bill are aimed at squeezing the people’s fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution as it allows the leakage of information related to citizens, violating their privacy and freedom. Hence, it has demanded that the government immediately withdraw the bill. The bill requires service providers to provide information to the NID should it demand details of the communications that took place between individuals or organisations over the telephone, mobile phone or computer.
It is not understandable why the government has tabled the new bill so soon after the Right to Privacy Act was enacted in September last year, fully knowing that this would raise an uproar as the two are not in harmony. True the government has every right to defend the sovereignty of the country and protect it from any attempt to raise arms against the state, incite communal hatred and acts of espionage, sabotage and subversion. But while doing so, the government must see to it that it does not infringe upon the human rights of its citizens. As some rights activists note, the bill, if passed into law, could be used by the government to increase surveillance against its opponents, rights activists and civil society members or collect information of individuals even on flimsy ground. Hence, it would be in the interest of the government not to push the bill through the Parliament on the strength of its near two-thirds majority. It will be good to hold wide consultations with the stakeholders and amend the bill accordingly so that the fundamental right to data protection is ensured, together with six other privacy rights guaranteed in the new privacy law.

Avoid heaters in rooms
With the chilly winter season in full swing, doctors have advised people not to use heaters, firewood and charcoal inside a closed room. People have died of suffocation, or asphyxia, when asleep due to lack of oxygen in the closed room. Fire absorbs oxygen from the surrounding in the process of burning and releases harmful carbon dioxide that can be fatal to those sleeping in a poorly-ventilated room.
Inhaling carbon dioxide kills the brain tissue, making people unconscious and unable to react promptly. This could eventually take the life of those unconscious people if they are not rescued on time. One must see to it that the electric heater, gas heater, burning firewood or charcoal have been taken care of before going to bed, and windows of the room must be kept open to allow fresh air into the room. In the case of new mothers, pregnant women, infants or ailing people, chances of death are higher as their resistance power is less than that of normal people. Police said most people living in  shanty areas use firewood to keep their room warm, and they are unaware of the harmful impact of carbon dioxide on their health. The best way to stay safe from such incidents is to keep the room well-ventilated and avoid using heaters.

A solar-powered power plant is proving to be a vital source of energy for many countries. In Nepal, too, solar power projects are gaining momentum. After hydropower projects, the second highest number of survey licenses have been issued for solar power projects.
There are many reasons for promoting solar power plants in Nepal. One of the major factors could be the minimal civil structures involved in solar power plants as compared to hydropower plants, which possess higher risk of damage during an earthquake. So during natural disasters, such as an earthquake, flooding or landslide, solar power plants could be a lifesaving source of energy. Due to its minimal civil structures, it could be revamped within a few months. Another concern is the depletion of water in snow-fed rivers due to global warming, which affects the energy production of hydropower plants.

In May 2018, the government released a white paper, with a target to produce 15,000 MW of electricity in 10 years. To achieve such an ambitious goal, large-scale solar power plants need to be developed as they can be commissioned in 2-3 years whereas a hydropower plant normally takes 7-8 years. Hence, the government should not underestimate the capacity of solar power plants. With increasing innovation, economy of scale and growing popularity, solar panels could see positive outcomes in terms of efficiency, capacity, characteristics and price.
For example, bifacial panels are gaining popularity, and recent research has shown that their efficiency could reach up to 30 per cent. One of the leading consulting firms, namely “Wood Mackenzie”, forecasts that spot prices for modules could fall from $0.30 per watt-DC in 2018 to $0.18 per watt-DC in the next five years, a 40 per cent drop.
Recently, a group of economists and mathematicians at Oxford University found convincing evidence of learning-curve effects across different products, including photovoltaic cells, whereas in the case of PV cells, it’s quite steep: for every doubling of output, cost falls by over 20 per cent. It is certain that the cost per MW of solar power plant will decrease rapidly.
Another reason to opt for solar energy is energy mix. Many countries around the world prefer not to depend on a single source of energy. An energy mix is considered to avoid complete blackout in case of failure, or deficiency, of one source of energy. For example, in the case of Germany, the share of energy sources in gross German power production in 2018 was: renewables (34.9%), lignite (22.5%), hard coal (12.9%), natural gas (12.9%) and nuclear (11.8%), which clearly shows the dependency of the nation on different sources of energy. Similarly, in India, coal, lignite, gas and diesel comprise 63.2 per cent, followed by renewables (including small hydro projects, biomass gasifiers, biomass power, urban and industrial waste power, solar and wind energy), which is 22.7 per cent, and 12.6 per cent for hydropower.
The above examples clearly depict that energy mix is practised in many countries around the world. The government in its white paper targeted a 5-10 per cent energy mix with alternative sources of energy other than hydro. Apparently, the second largest potential source of energy is solar, which is a relatively newcomer: only 1.68 MW of solar power is connected to the national grid. To close the gap between the massive need for solar energy and the current supply, many solar power plants should be constructed and connected to the national grid. Let’s say, 5 per cent of energy mix of the total targeted 15000 MW of electricity would be 750 MW and 10 per cent would be 1500 MW. So, within 10 years, Nepal needs some large solar farms on a MW scale, which will assist the government to reach its target.
Grid connected solar power projects with battery storage could act in a manner similar to that of peaking run-of-the river hydropower projects, specifically during the evening peak hours. This kind of system enhances the effectiveness of solar power plants especially during the dry season and peak hours. Currently, Nepal is importing electricity during the energy-deficient season. There is also an advantage to the developer as far as the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) rate is concerned as such battery storage solar power plant could claim a PPA similar to the peaking run-of-the river hydropower projects. Thus, developing solar farms will also be cost-effective.
Large-scale solar power plants would be more preferable to the traditional means of power generation, such as coal power plants, and considering wildlife and land use impacts. The impact is less compared to a storage type hydropower project, as there could be devastating impact in case of dam failure, either by a natural disaster or design failure.
The only issue is the massive use of land for large-scale solar power projects, which is only unjustifiable in case of land use in forested regions and agricultural land. It could be anticipated that solar panels have low reflectivity and convert a large fraction of insolation into heat, which could lead to concerns that they may affect the global or local climate. To sum up, solar farms should be given a serious consideration. The omnipresent bright sun would surely enlighten the path to a prosperous Nepal.

300,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/human-resource-and-employee-satisfaction/,"Human resource is used to describe both the people who work for an organisation and the department responsible for managing resources related to employees. Here, I shall focus on people who work for the organisation rather than the department as a whole. The earlier one is also termed as ‘human capital’.
In today’s world, it is easy for organisations to invest in different directions. But before doing so, it is important to question ourselves where the investment will be the wisest to stand ahead of the competitors. Should we expand our business by investing aggressively on marketing? Should we open a new branch? Should we acquire some other business? One of the most important investments overlooked and sometimes ignored by most of the organisations is investing in human capital – their people.
The statement that human capital is the most important capital of a company is not new. This statement has been used time and again by CEOs, consultants, human resource management advisers and other stakeholders in a company. However, when they are asked, why “human capital” is not a part of the company’s financial balance sheet as such, then the question is not understood, and they say that the cost of the staff is in the exploitation account of the company it belongs to.
This is a major bottleneck: Personnel are considered a cost item for the company. However, this is not the case as employee satisfaction leads to ultimate increase in profitability of an organisation. Working condition and resources, work relationships, compensation and benefits and employee recognition are the four key attributes of employee satisfaction.
Further, if an organisation takes these things into consideration positively, favouring investment in the employees rather than seeing them as a mere expense to the company, the outcome would be exciting. Employee satisfaction leads to employee commitment and engagement, thereby driving business results.
Lastly, my request is to focus on employee satisfaction in their organisation. In the short run, it would look like a mere expense to an organisation, but in the long run, it will give returns just as an investment. Employees will be advocates of your firm, increasing the client base and quality of work. Some of the best companies of the world take employee satisfaction as one of the major factors for what they are today.

301,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-tough-law-needed/,"Road accidents can be minimised to some extent provided the bus owners and drivers are held accountable for the passengers’ safety
Fifteen persons were killed and 18 others injured, most of them critically, when a reserved bus met with a road accident at Six Kilo in Sunkoshi Rural Municipality, Sindhupalchowk Sunday morning. The police said the accident occurred when the bus en route to Bhaktapur from Kalinchowk, Dolakha fell about 500 metres below the road along the Lamosanghu-Jiri road. Nine women, five men and one child lost their lives while 18 others injured in the fatal accident were rushed to various hospitals for treatment. Police said the condition of most of the injured was critical. Those who survived the accident said they had reserved the bus for a pilgrimage to Kalinchowk, and they had stayed overnight at Mude. They said the bus met with the accident after the driver lost control at a sharp bend. Around 35 people were travelling in the ill-fated bus. The bus driver fled the scene immediately after the accident, and the police have launched a manhunt to nab him. The way the bus met with the accident shows that the driver was not familiar with the condition of the serpentine hilly road, where accidents occur quite often. In the past several months, Araniko Highway has seen many fatal bus accidents due to drivers’ negligence and poor maintenance of the public buses.
Nationwide, as many as 230 people have lost their lives in the past 28 days, majority of them in fatal road accidents. Nineteen people were killed on November 28 when a bus fell from the road at Narapani, Arghakhanchi, and 14 people were killed in a jeep accident in Baglung’s Badigad Rural Municipality on December 3. According to the Traffic Police, as many as 1,426 people were injured in road accidents within one month, while as many as 1,030 people have lost their lives in 7,505 road accidents in the last five months. A total of 7,961 persons were injured in road accidents during this fiscal. The figures for the road accidents reveal the utter negligence on the part of the concerned bodies, particularly the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, Department of Transport Management (DoTM) and Traffic Police, who are mostly concentrated in the cities.
The saddest part is that the government has not formed a probe panel even after 1,030 people were killed in the road accidents in the last five months. Nor have the ministry, DoTM and Traffic Police discussed ways to minimise road accidents. The government has also not initiated discussion on a draft bill on transport to hold the bus owner and driver accountable for passengers’ safety. Road accidents in Nepal are the highest in South Asia. On an average, seven people are killed in road accidents every day. Bus drivers are issued driving license without proper training. States in neighbouring India sharing similar topography see minimum road accidents because of the tough licensing system. Ten years of driving experience is required to drive a vehicle in the mountains in some of these states. This approach could be highly useful in Nepal’s hilly terrain, too. Besides the poor condition of the roads and carelessness of the drivers, bad maintenance of a vehicle and overloading are also contributing to tragic road accidents. Road accidents can be minimised if these problems are duly addressed by the concerned authorities.

Congested jails
With crime growing in the country by leaps and bounds, it is putting undue pressure on the limited capacity of jails across Nepal. The 74 jails spread across 72 of the country’s 77 districts have a capacity for just 15,466 prisoners, but there are 23,775 jailbirds in them. Some of the prisons are bursting at their seams, and this has had telling effect on the health of the prisoners, space to sleep, overall sanitation and food quality. The jails have not only Nepali prisoners, but also foreigners, who are there for overstaying their visa, drug smuggling, cyber crime and pedophilia, among others. They must find the conditions in Nepal’s prisons really appalling.
It is good to learn that space for as many as 4,166 prisoners was added during the past one year. And quite a few jails are under construction, including Nepal’s biggest – meant for 7,000 inmates – at Nuwakot, to the west of Kathmandu. Hopefully, they will not only ease the congestion seen in Nepal’s jails at present but also provide better living conditions, such as more space, recreation facilities and a library and educational opportunities, to the prisoners. Prisons should be more of a correction centre than a place for punishing inmates.

302,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/teachers-and-learner-autonomy-possibilities-and-challenges/,"A learner autonomous pedagogy has such attributes as resource centres in the classroom or even outside the classroom like a library and a computer lab, where students can have uninhibited access to what they need or want to learn
Anyone with a non-rebellious inclination and schooled predominantly under a teacher-centred system of education expects learning and knowledge to trickle down from the teachers.
This writer is amongst that anyone, and it probably wouldn’t have mattered much had he gone on to pursue any profession other than teaching.
The pedagogical spirit of today is clearly in favour of promoting learner autonomy as opposed to heteronomy, which, by numerous scholarly definitions of the word, he was surely subject to.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Staying with scholarly definitions, the term, learner autonomy, was first coined in 1981 by Henric Holec, who defined it as the “ability to take charge of one’s own learning”. This implies that learners take ownership and make decisions for their learning themselves.
Heteronomy, by contrast, is seen to be lying at the opposite end of this continuum, a top down pedagogy, and heavily teacher-centred.
All these exposures have had an unavoidable implication in his classroom, and he might well be a representative character here of teachers who oscillate between heteronomy and autonomy, but clearly favouring the latter nonetheless.
A combination of various approaches have been adopted in order to promote learner autonomy. Workshops and trainings, to the extent that this writer has attended and is familiar with, are geared towards the objective of making students lifelong learners and much less reliant on outside agency, or teachers. The newly formulated national educational framework enshrines this idea and urges the concerned stakeholders to strive for it.
If this were to be called a paradigm shift, it indeed may have happened in terms of policy documents and at the theoretical level, but the shift in practical terms may not be as swift. They take place piecemeal, with teachers indeed trying out new or the newly suggested ways while reverting time and again to the familiar and known practices.
As long as they have been trying – this teacher for one has consistently been trying – it could be taken as a sign of progress.
A major dilemma that a teacher faces though is the question of how much autonomy is good autonomy. And what is he/she to do of a scenario where what a learner needs to learn is already predetermined by the curriculum?
Promoting learner autonomy becomes even more challenging for teachers in the backdrop of time-bound examinations, which the students must compulsorily take.
Ergo, the torn teacher, who despite the knowledge of the known benefits of learner autonomy, cannot put it into practice all the time. In whatsoever proportion it does happen though, if the teachers are making it happen, they might have been doing a good job.
A learner autonomous pedagogy has such attributes as resource centres in the classroom or even outside the classroom like a library and a computer lab, where they can have uninhibited access to what they need or want to learn.
Encouraging portfolio-based learning, coupled with a lot of self-reflection and journals about one’s process of learning, is another approach towards that goal.
Any teacher who has upwards of 25 students and a 45-minute time slot per day, without a co-teacher, can well relate the amount of patience and flexibility required for such modes of learning.
In a recently held weekly speakers’ club of Kathmandu University, Prof. Zakia Sarwar, founding member and Hon. Executive Director of Society of Pakistan English Language Teachers (SPELT), observed that the teachers’ mindset is the biggest hurdle to learner autonomy.
It surely is, especially if still in this day and age, where a plethora of other means are at the disposal of the students to learn, teachers hold fast to ‘I teach, you learn’ position.
However, even the ones with an open mindset face a different kind of challenge – the challenge resulting much less from their own conviction of the expected fruits of learner-centredness than from the constraints posed by the system under which both the teachers and learners must operate.
Reading of the available literature on learner autonomy makes this writer feel, in his capacity as a teacher, that perhaps it is too idealistic to implement and expect learner autonomy in its entirety.
That actually may be too high and an unrealistic goal to set in the first place. Besides the various institutional constraints, there is also skepticism that arises in the teachers out of the contradictions between the real classroom learning outcomes and various such theoretical claims.
The best that this writer has been able to do as a teacher is make efforts towards promoting learner autonomy whenever possible and feasible.
Students collaborate, make use of learning centres, work on self-chosen projects – all of which fits the bill of learner autonomy. On other days, it is not uncommon to find their teachers holding forth, explaining if not lecturing and demanding certain answers to be written in a certain way while still trying to keep their minds open. It might still be possible to make the students independent and responsible towards the path of life-long learning amidst just the right bit of teacher intervention.

303,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/relevance-of-education/,"When I first embarked on my career, we had a co-worker, a rich man, a scion of industry. He had returned from Canada with an MBA degree. Those days an MBA degree was as valuable as a medical or engineering degree if not more. An MBA degree meant entry as a manager. I joined as a trainee and was still a couple of steps away from climbing to that post. The MBA chap made me feel lacking even though I was already holding a weighty responsibility. I, too, harboured a dream to do my MBA after garnering a few years of work experience. As destiny will have it, the company ‘sacked’ the MBA chap before he could even complete his probation period. And this forced me to give up my MBA dream and instead focussed on working diligently to become a manager. I soon realised that one requires a lot more qualities and skills, not necessarily negative ones, other than an MBA degree to become successful in a country like Nepal. One did not even require a higher degree to be successful in business.
A banker and ‘industrialist’ often claims in the social media that although he studied up to 8 or 10 standards, he employs master degree and PhDs in his companies. I have an acquaintance who ran an airline even though he had not completed his school education. On the other hand, a PhD from JNU in Peace and Conflict Management is doing odd jobs to survive. While teaching part-time in a Plus Two factory, I asked a student who would come to class once in a blue moon not to bother coming to school. He could not even write his name in Nepali, let alone English. During my classes, I would urge the students to take up a part-time job or learn a manual skill. I would tell the students that the waiter’s job could teach many skills.
Unbeknownst to me, the delinquent student started working as a waiter. He then started coming to school once in a couple of months. A year or so after I quit teaching, the student greeted me in the street. At first, I did not recognise him. The lout had transformed into a smart man. He started working in a restaurant and had become a skilled bartender.
A few months later he sent a message on messenger saying he was working at the VIP lounge in Doha Airport. Some of his bright classmates are still looking for jobs in Kathmandu. Unless people go for technical education like medical, engineering or flying, formal education might not guarantee success in the job market.

304,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-bring-culprits-to-book/,"It is best the police stay away from situations they were not trained for and allow competent agencies to handle them
Three persons, including a police inspector, were killed in a bomb explosion in Chhireswornath Municipality in Dhanusha district Friday night, an incident that could have been largely avoided if only common sense had prevailed. According to reports, the police inspector, Amir Dahal, had set off the pressure cooker bomb planted at the gate of the house belonging to a local, Rajesh Sah, with a stick instead of waiting for a bomb disposal unit of the Nepal Army to arrive on the scene. There are speculations that the inspector might have thought the bomb hanging from the door handle was a hoax, but his foolhardiness not only took the lives of the house owner and his son but also injured three other members of Sah’s family and a policeman. The father and son duo had died on the spot while the inspector died on the way to hospital. What is particularly sad is that the very person who had called the police to report about the bomb should die in the explosion. There is little doubt that carelessness on the part of Inspector Dahal led to the tragic accident.
As per reports, an unidentified person had informed Rajesh about the IED (improvised explosive device) by telephone, but it is not known who could possibly have planted it in his house. But the police have made some arrests on suspicion that the IED might have been planted by cadres of the outlawed Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), led by Netra Bikram Chand. The party’s cadres have been involved in such nefarious activities in the past – setting off bombs in communication giant Ncell’s offices and towers and in extorting money from teachers and civil servants in the countryside – but the CPN has not owned up to the incident. The deceased, Rajesh, owned a pharmacy and is said to have been lending money to locals at exorbitant interest rates, of upto 36 per cent. Could this have been a reason for targeting Rajesh? Whatever the reason, planting a bomb in someone’s house with the intention of destroying life and property, if need be, is a condemnable act.
The Dhanusha incident should be an eye opener to the police force about how not to deal with sensitive safety matters. Many a times, police folly or highhandedness has only aggravated a situation, as was the case last week in Kohalpur in mid-west Nepal, after a truck hit an 11-year-old girl about to enter school, crushing both her legs. The police need better training to enhance their skills in dealing with different circumstances. It is best they stay away from situations they were not trained for – in this case disposal of bombs – and allow competent agencies to handle them. Minister for Home Affairs Ram Bahadur Thapa has vowed to act tough and bring the culprits involved in planting the bomb to book. The people will be watching how soon he does this. Although there has been an improvement in the law and order situation over the years with the writing of the new constitution in 2015, there are some political groups that have refused to join mainstream politics, instead resorting to intimidating tactics to push their agenda through. It is time the Home Ministry acted tough against them so that people feel safe and secure in the society.

Bicycle lanes
Cycling is a good exercise. An hour of cycling a day keeps a person physically fit and healthy. However, the Kathmandu Valley does not have dedicated lanes for cyclists along the major thoroughfares. During the local level elections, all the political parties had promised to make all the municipalities of the Valley bicycle-friendly. However, they have failed to keep their promises. Some sections of the city areas have seen declared bicycle-friendly, but they are unsafe for the bicycle users.
Marking the 25th anniversary of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) on Saturday, the city mayor, Bidhya Sundar Shakya, vowed to introduce cycle lanes in major parts of the city in the near future.
In 2014, the government had declared both sides of the Maitighar-Tinkune road segment as dedicated cycle lanes. But they are now used as footpaths. The KMC must coordinate with the Department of Roads (DoR) if it wants to develop cycle lanes in the city areas as DoR is the sole agency to take care of them. Once some sections of the roads are dedicated to cycle lanes, none else should be allowed to use them. The traffic police must make sure that the cycle lanes are used only by the cyclists, not by motorcyclists and others.

The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (GBV), an annual international campaign, came to an end on December 10. Amid the campaign, the world has witnessed many cases of GBV. Priyanka Reddy, a 26-year-old veterinary doctor in Hyderabad, India was gang raped and murdered, which sparked outrage across India and even the world. Similarly in Nepal, Parwati Budha Rawat was found dead while staying in a “menstruation hut” in Achham district, Sudurpaschim Province. Likewise, a few months ago, Aarti Chaudhary, had filed a complaint at the District Police Office in Dhanusha after her husband, Indrajit, and in-laws physically abused her for failing to bring enough dowry.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
One question regarding this issue is, why did the girl’s side not file a complaint against Indrajit when dowry was demanded in the initial phase? When someone files a case against demand for ‘enough dowry’, does it not indicate that dowry is legal? Dowry is related to the mindset of the people and is an anti-social practice.
The above incidents of GBV are only representative cases. However, violence against women is being endured even in the 21st century. Despite the feminist movement, GBV exists in Nepal and throughout the globe. In Nepal, in particular, such a scenario is related to the level of women’s empowerment and their level of domination in leadership positions. Since women’s presence in the state apparatuses is very low, GBV cases are not being handled aggressively.
There had been a political deadlock in Nepal for decades. After completion of three elections and the constitutional obligation in the aftermath in favour of gender and social inclusion, the political impasse has ended. Full participation of women in political life is not only a guarantee of their human rights, but also an essential requirement in building peaceful societies. The veteran human rights activist, Michelle Bachelet, once said, “When one woman is a leader, it changes her. When more women are leaders, it changes politics and policies.”
Regarding the status of Nepali women’s representation, there is a need to shed some light on it. Nepali women’s representation in the legislative body was dramatically increased to 32.8 per cent through the Constituent Assembly (CA) election held in 2008. In the election, 191 women leaders (33.2 per cent) were elected out of 575 seats, and the Cabinet nominated six women out of 26 seats, resulting in 197 women members (32.8 per cent) in the legislative parliament. As a result, Nepal stands 14th globally in sending women leaders to the legislature parliament. The reason behind the dramatic change in women’s representation is the reservation of seats provided through the Interim Constitution of Nepal, 2007. This gradual constitutional obligation also gave the first woman president in Nepal.
With the first woman president, there is some hope that people will see positive change in terms of empowering women through education and developing their leadership capacity. Beyond its intrinsic value, greater gender equality in politics and public life will bring distinct orientations and behaviours to office. Indeed, among citizens and legislators, women and men often have different political interests and priorities, issue positions, party preferences and legislative behaviours. Although the mere presence of women in political positions does not guarantee any particular policy outcome, their greater representation in the legislature has been linked to increased legislative focus on health and family policy, more spending on social services and less on defense.
Currently the Federal Parliament has 32.7 per cent women. But very few women are seen vocal in raising concerns on national issues with rationality. So they need to be provided leadership training to sharpen their capacity. If we look at the political parties, constitutionally, all four parties—the Nepal Communist Party, Nepali Congress, Samajwadi Party Nepal and Rastriya Janta Party Nepal—are illegitimate in that they have failed to ensure the constitutionally-mandated minimum 33 per cent of women in the party structures. The status of women in the Nepali bureaucracy is just as pathetic.
In Nepal, due to the constitutional obligations, women have been able to hold political positions as mere representatives. But there is a vast difference between representation and leadership. The time has come to think why the representatives cannot be ‘leaders’. The feminist critique of patriarchy is founded on the arguments that all social structures and systems, and all political systems, are patriarchal. According to feminist arguments, the division of power between men and women that has persisted throughout human history systematically oppresses and disadvantages women. It operates throughout society, in politics, work, the family, legal and judicial systems.
Last but not the least, women should be posted at law enforcing positions. There is a need to eliminate the patriarchal mindset from society, only after which a level of change will be seen in the society. The anti dowry and chhaupadi law must be implemented brutally to discourage such anti-social practices.

307,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/decade-in-review-what-the-smartphone-has-wrought/,"Dec 23: When the first Apple iPhone hit the market in 2007, not everyone was convinced it would supplant the flip-phone. When Google’s Android software system arrived a year later, the Blackberry still seemed to have bright future.
But with the iPhone 4 in 2010, featuring a high-resolution display, sleek design and front-facing camera, our collective fate was sealed. Here are 10 ways the smartphone has made its mark over the decade.
Access everywhere
Today some 5 billion smartphones are in use around the world, according to Canalys Research. The total number of internet subscriptions has soared to 7.2 billion globally from 1.3 billion in 2010, the vast majority of them mobile subscriptions, International Telecommunications Union data shows. The explosion in connectivity has been especially dramatic in the developing world, where there are now more mobile connections than people.
Tech uber alles
Apple Inc, once a niche computer company, is now one of the world’s most valuable companies thanks to the iPhone. The five largest Fortune 500 technology companies – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook – currently boast a market cap of $4.7 trillion, compared with about $800 billion for the top five in 2010. Not all of that is due to the smartphone, of course, but the mobile-related technologies and services accounted for nearly $4 trillion in economic activity in 2018, according to trade group GSMA.
There’s an app for that
Whether we’re hailing a cab, ordering food, playing a game, finding a date, listening to music or shopping for just about anything, there’s a good chance we’ll be doing it with a smartphone app that didn’t exist in 2010. Many of most popular apps are free, but consumers are still expected to spend more than $120 billion in app stores during 2019, according to App Annie, a mobile apps analytics firm.
Feed me
The endless scroll on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media apps now consumes 34 minutes of every U.S. adult’s day, according to Nielsen. Fewer people are sitting on the sofa to watch live TV at set times, and advertisers are following. Mobile ad spending surpassed TV for the first time in 2018 in terms of percentage share of the U.S. market, according to research firm eMarketer. We can also thank the smartphone for Instagram influencers, “sextortion,” and fake news.
Smile for the (smartphone) camera
Global shipments of digital cameras dropped from their 2010 peak of 121 million to just 19 million units in 2018, according to the Camera & Imaging Products Association (CIPA). Meantime the latest phones pack as many four camera lenses and cutting edge software that makes it easier than ever to get that perfect shot. The front-facing camera might be the busiest: Google reports that its Android devices take 93 million selfies every day.
Where am I?
The satellite tracking technology known as GPS, combined with information from cell towers and Wi-Fi networks, has made the smartphones incredibly powerful tracking devices. Google maps and its poorer cousins enable even the most directionally impaired find their way around unfamiliar locales with ease.
For the privacy-minded, though, it’s a disaster: Phone companies and app makers routinely record the movements of subscribers and sell that data to advertisers, a $20 billion-a-year business. The data is “anonymized,” but as numerous studies and a recent New York Times investigation have revealed it is often a simple matter to identify who is behind the dot on the map. Nearly 50% of companies surveyed by Verizon this year used or planned to soon use smartphone management tools to track their employees.
You can look it up
The 2010 edition of the venerable Encyclopedia Britannica, all 32 volumes and 129 pounds of it, turned out to be the last. But untold barroom arguments or dining room debates can now be settled on the spot: Wikipedia is consulted more than 240 million times daily.
Distracting ourselves to death
In 2018 alone in the United States, 2,628 fatal crashes involved a distracted driver, and of those deadly crashes, about 13% involved mobile phone use, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
Forget your wallet
Apple Pay and Google Pay are still afterthoughts for most U.S. consumers, but China may be a harbinger. Alipay and WeChat pay, China’s two big smartphone payment services, have reached a combined adoption rate of over 80% since they were launched around the beginning of the decade, according to a study by Bain. The QR code now peppers storefront windows. Even streetside beggars have adapted, sometimes rejecting cash and asking that payments be made via WeChat Pay or Alipay.
Say what?
Among the major casualties of the smartphone era is the conventional phone call itself: ubiquitous messaging apps have helped make video calls, GIFs, emojis and audio messaging preferred modes of communication. In the UK, for example, the total number of minutes spent on voice calls fell from 254 billion in 2013 to 206 billion in 2018, and the number of text messages dropped from 129 billion to 74 billion over the same period, according to Ofcom. Mobile data usage, meanwhile, jumped almost nine-fold between 2013 and 2018. The number of available emojis has nearly tripled to almost 3,000 since 2010.

308,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/bulls-eye-landing-caps-boeings-faulty-astronaut-capsule-test-mission/,"WASHINGTON: Boeing Co’s Starliner astronaut spacecraft made a “bull’s-eye” landing in the New Mexico desert on Sunday, a successful ending to a crewless test mission that two days earlier failed to reach the orbit needed to dock with the International Space Station.
The 7:58 am ET (1258 GMT) landing at the White Sands desert capped a turbulent 48 hours for Boeing’s botched milestone test of an astronaut capsule that is designed to help NASA regain its human spaceflight capabilities.
A software problem on Friday caused the capsule to fail to attain the orbit needed to rendezvous with the space station, another unwelcome engineering black eye for Boeing in a year that has seen corporate crisis over the grounding of its 737 MAX jetliner following two fatal crashes of the aircraft.

Officials from the aerospace company and NASA breathed sighs of relief following the landing, a highly challenging feat.
“Today it couldn’t really have gone any better,” Boeing space chief executive Jim Chilton told reporters on Sunday, adding that experts would need weeks to analyze the data from this mission before determining if Boeing could move forward with its plan to send a crewed mission on the craft in 2020.
The landing, which tested the capsule’s difficult reentry into the atmosphere and parachute deployment, will yield the mission’s most valuable test data after it failed to meet one of its core objectives of docking to the space station.
“We’re going to get I think a lot more data than we would have gotten if the test had gone according to plan,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said.
After Starliner’s touchdown, teams of engineers in trucks raced to inspect the vehicle, whose six airbags cushioned its impact on the desert surface as planned, a live video feed showed.
The spacecraft was in good condition after landing, Chilton said, with little charring and stable air pressure and temperature in the cabin.
The CST-100 Starliner’s debut launch to orbit was a milestone test for Boeing. The company is vying with SpaceX, the privately held rocket company of billionaire high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, to revive NASA’s human spaceflight capabilities. SpaceX carried out a successful unmanned flight of its Crew Dragon capsule to the space station in March.
After the Starliner capsule was launched from Florida on Friday, an automated timer error prevented it from attaining the right orbit to meet and dock with the space station. Chilton said the timer was running 11 hours ahead, which caused the spacecraft to burn fuel too quickly.

PARACHUTE CHALLENGE
Starliner’s three main parachutes deployed just over one mile (1,600 metres) from the Earth’s surface on Sunday after enduring intense heat from the violent reentry through the atmosphere, plummeting at 25 times the speed of sound.
The parachute deployment, one of the most challenging procedures under the program to develop a commercial manned space capsule, earned Boeing a win after a previous mishap where one parachute failed to deploy during a November test of Starliner’s abort thrusters.
That test tossed the capsule miles into the sky to demonstrate its ability to land a crew safely back on the ground in the event of a launch failure.
For the current mission, Boeing and NASA officials said they still do not understand why software caused the craft to miss the orbit required.
Sunday’s landing marked the first time a US orbital space capsule designed for humans landed on land.
All past US capsules, including SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, splashed down in the ocean. Russia’s Soyuz capsules and China’s past crew capsules made land landings.
The now-retired Space Shuttle used to glide in like a massive plane.

309,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/twitter-facebook-ban-fake-users-some-had-ai-created-photos/,"NEW YORK: Twitter has identified and removed nearly 6,000 accounts that it said were part of a coordinated effort by Saudi government agencies and individuals to advance the country’s geopolitical interests.
Separately, Facebook said it removed hundreds of Facebook accounts, groups and pages linked to inauthentic behaviour from two separate groups, one originating in the country of Georgia and one in  Vietnam, which targeted people both in Vietnam and in the US
Facebook said some of the accounts used profile photos generated by artificial intelligence and masqueraded as Americans. It is one of the first such misinformation efforts to use material generated by AI.
Tech companies have stepped up efforts to tackle misinformation on their services ahead of next year’s US presidential elections. The efforts followed revelations that Russians bankrolled thousands of fake political ads during the 2016 elections to sow dissent among Americans.
Twitter’s and Facebook’s announcements underscore the fact that misinformation concerns aren’t limited to the US and Russia.
In a blog post-Friday, Twitter said the removed Saudi accounts were amplifying messages favourable to Saudi authorities, mainly through “aggressive liking, retweeting and replying.” While the majority of the content was in Arabic, Twitter said the tweets also amplified discussions about sanctions in Iran and appearances by Saudi government officials in Western media.
“Governments have started to launch influence campaigns the same ways commercial enterprises launch campaigns to sell detergent or cars,” said James Ludes, a national defence expert who teaches international relations and public policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.
He said the Russian efforts in 2016 showed it was possible to “actually change public attitudes through the targeted use of social media.”
While the attempts to root out the campaigns may seem like a game of whack-a-mole, he said companies have at least shown progress in taking steps to identify and root out manipulation campaigns run by foreign powers.
Twitter began archiving tweets and media it deems to be associated with known state-backed information operations in 2018. It shut 200,000 Chinese accounts that targeted Hong Kong protests in August.
The 5,929 accounts removed and added to the archives are part of a larger group of 88,000 accounts engaged in “spammy behaviour” across a wide range of topics. But Twitter isn’t disclosing all of them because some might be legitimate accounts taken over through hacking.
The Twitter accounts were linked to a social media marketing firm in Saudi Arabia called Smaat that managed many government departments in Saudi Arabia. The accounts used third-party automated tools to amplify non-political content at high volumes. Twitter said that activity was used to mask the political manoeuvrings of the same accounts.
Samuel Woolley, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies disinformation, said that while the Saudi campaign used basic manipulation techniques, including the use of likes and retweets to give the illusion of popularity, the campaign’s size and scale were unusual. The existence of a thousands-strong army of Saudi accounts also show that social media companies still don’t have a good solution, he said, despite the progress, they have made at identifying state-backed accounts.
“It’s really clear we have to do something about it,” he said. “It can’t just be after the fact. We have to get better about detecting in real-time.”
Messages left with Saudi officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the country’s embassy in Washington was not immediately returned.
The Saudi government has used different tactics to control speech and keep reformers and others from organizing, including employing troll armies to harass and intimidate users online. It has also arrested and imprisoned Twitter users.
In September, Twitter suspended the account of the crown prince’s former top adviser, Saud al-Qahtani, who also served as director of the cybersecurity federation. As with Friday’s announcement, Twitter said that account had violated the company’s platform manipulation policy.
Last month, two former Twitter employees were charged with acting as agents of Saudi Arabia without registering with the US government. The complaint details a coordinated effort by Saudi government officials to recruit employees at the social media giant to look up the private data of Twitter accounts, including email addresses linked to the accounts and internet protocol addresses that can give up a user’s location.
In terms of Facebook’s actions, Facebook said the Georgia group targeted domestic audiences and the Vietnam group focused mainly in the US, as well as Vietnamese-, Spanish- and Chinese-speaking audiences around the world.
The company said they created networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing. To evade detection, they used a combination of fake and real accounts of people in the US to manage pages and groups, the company said.
“We are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we’ve said before, it’s an ongoing challenge,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security policy, said in a blog post.

PARIS: France’s competition authority fined Google 150 million euros ($167 million) for anti-competitive behaviour and for having unclear advertising on the Google Ads page.
The fine comes as France and other European countries maintain high levels of scrutiny on major US tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, which are often criticised for having relatively low tax payments.
In September, Google agreed to pay close to 1 billion euros to French authorities to settle a fiscal fraud probe that began four years ago.
Google, which is the world’s biggest internet search engine, has also faced growing regulatory scrutiny about the content it promotes in search results and ads.
Isabelle de Silva, head of the French competition authority, told news conference that Google’s dominance in the online advertising business was “extraordinary”, with the US company having a market share of around 90% in that field.
Google said it would appeal the fine.
In January, France’s data protection watchdog had fined Google 50 million euros for breaching European Union online privacy rules.
The French watchdog stated in that January ruling that Google lacked transparency and clarity in the way it informed users about its handling of personal data, and had failed to properly obtain their consent for personalised ads.

311,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/scientists-narrow-age-estimate-for-fossils-of-human-ancestor/,"NEW YORK: Scientists say they have finally calculated the age of the youngest known remains of Homo erectus, which is generally considered an ancestor of our species.
The fossilised skull fragments and other bones were uncovered on the Indonesian island of Java in the 1930s. Determining their age has been a scientific challenge, and a wide range has been proposed by numerous studies.


In a report released Wednesday by the journal Nature, scientists conclude the remains are between 108,000 and 117,000 years old. Researchers used five dating techniques on sediments and fossil animal bones from the area, combining 52 age estimates for the analysis. The project took 13 years to complete.
“I don’t see any way to date this site more thoroughly,” said paleoanthropologist Russell Ciochon of the University of Iowa, an author of the study.
H. erectus arose in Africa about 2 million years ago and spread widely there and in Asia, and possibly into Europe. It reached Java more than 1.5 million years ago, and the new dates suggest it died out at least 35,000 years before the arrival there of our own species, Homo sapiens.
H. erectus may have been doomed on Java by climate change that turned its open woodland environment into rain forest, Ciochon said. Still, it evidently existed longer on Earth than any other species on our “Homo” branch of the evolutionary tree.
Susan Anton, a New York University anthropologist who did not participate in the work, called the dating effort “heroic.” But she said she considered the reported age range to be too narrow. She said she preferred a span of less than 550,000 years old to more than 100,000 years old.
That’s roughly what she and co-authors proposed in a paper published in 2011. The younger end of the range in that paper was as recent as 120,000 years, which she said is virtually the same as the new result.

Danish scientists have managed to extract a complete human DNA sample from a piece of birch pitch more than 5,000 years old, used as a kind of chewing gum, a study revealed yesterday.
The Stone-Age sample yielded enough information to determine the source’s sex, what she had last eaten and the germs in her mouth. It also told them she probably had dark hair, dark skin and blue eyes.

And genetically, she was more closely related to hunter-gatherers from the mainland Europe than to those living in central Scandinavia at the time, they concluded.
“It is the first time that an entire ancient human genome has been extracted from anything other than human bones,” Hannes Schroeder of the University of Copenhagen, told AFP.
Schroeder is co-author of the study, which was published in the review Nature Communications.
They found the sample during an archaeological dig at Syltholm, in southern Denmark, said Tehis Jensen, one of the other authors.
“Syltholm is completely unique,” he said.
“Almost everything is sealed in mud, which means that the preservation of organic remains is absolutely phenomenal.”
The researchers also recovered traces of plant and animal DNA — hazelnut and duck — confirming what archaeologists already know about the people who lived there at the time.
But they were not sure why their subject chose to chew the bark: whether to turn it into a kind of glue, to clean her teeth, to stave off hunger — or simply as chewing gum.

In the labs of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a research unit of Columbia University overlooking the Hudson River, the scientists led by Professor Braddock Linsley pore over feet-long coral cores they extracted from far-away reefs.
For Linsley and his colleagues, corals are a precious repository of clues about the past that may help predict future climate trends. They can also reveal how much and how fast environmental conditions have changed during a certain period of time.
Cores are the hard, stony part of a coral underneath the top of the colony – its skeleton. Much like trees, corals produce growth rings that record climatic conditions like seawater temperatures and rainfall as they grow.
In a lab room packed with boxes of coral samples, Linsley and a small team of colleagues cut the cores into slabs and then X-ray the slabs to reveal the annual growth bands.
Using dentist drills, they pulverize small pieces and run geochemical analyses of the coral dust to reconstruct changes in the temperature, salinity and acidity of the water around the coral on a monthly basis going back hundreds of years.
“It is years of lab work and a lot of frustration but once you get to that point, the final product is just so exciting because you’ve got this long dataset,” Linsley said.
Coral reefs develop over thousands of years and are vital to the survival and prosperity of countless marine species. They also curtail flood damage from storms and support human activities like fisheries.
As humans burn more fossil fuel – the biggest contributor to global warming – oceans absorb growing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2).
Some of Linsley’s recent research on corals from the South Pacific island of Tonga suggests that increased seawater acidification caused by excess CO2 could lead to a decline in coral growth rates, endangering the wellbeing of entire reefs.

LOVE AT FIRST CHANCE
Linsley, a tall and soft-spoken 60-year-old, grew up on the Connecticut coast, making dams in the sand and observing erosion on the beaches near the town of Guilford. He loved water and began his career studying ocean sediments and fossils.
His work on corals began after a chance encounter with a colleague who was visiting his girlfriend at the University of New Mexico – where Linsley was studying to get his PhD in the late 1980s – led to a collaboration.
“I was fascinated by the fact that the corals had these annual bands in them and you could potentially extract annual resolve records back several hundred years,” he said at his office in the leafy campus, papers and books scattered on his desk and photos of diving expeditions on the wall.
Corals also brought him closer to the water and he had to learn how to dive, a perk of the job for Linsley.
By studying the environmental records derived from corals, the scientist is hoping to be able to shine a light on issues like the rate of surface ocean warming, ocean acidification and the impact on coral reef ecosystems worldwide.
But one thing is already evident, he said. Environmental changes are happening much more rapidly than in the last several thousand years and they are “clearly linked” to human activity.
Linsley’s childhood home in Connecticut – which he said now regularly battles encroaching waters – stood as a stark reminder.
“My children are 11 and 13. I think about in 50 years from now when I’m not here, what’s it going to be like,” he said.

314,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/remote-island-off-east-timor-turns-sunlight-air-into-drinking-water/,"KUALA LUMPUR: Villagers on a tiny island off the coast of East Timor who have long struggled with water shortages have secured regular fresh supplies, using just air and the power of the sun.
The innovative scheme uses solar power to suck water out of the air and make it drinkable, with the aim of reducing plastic waste and providing the small community on the wildlife-rich island of Atauro with a renewable supply of drinking water.
“The people living on Atauro have not had the opportunity to drink clean water that is not packaged in plastic,” said Rob Bartrop, chief revenue officer at Zero Mass Water the US technology firm behind the scheme.
“For the first time … they have a renewable source of water they can rely on,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Population growth and climate change are putting increasingly intense pressure on the planet’s limited water supplies, with worsening shortages emerging from the Middle East to Asia and Latin America, researchers said last month.
Like many similar islands in the region, Atauro lacks water infrastructure, leaving its 10,000 inhabitants reliant on rainwater and bottled supplies shipped in to meet their needs.
The new project, run with the US non-profit Conservation International, began operating in June and uses a material to absorb or suck water out of the air which is then turned into clean water.
In addition to reducing Atauro’s plastic water bottle waste, the project produces 12,000 litres of drinking water per month.
Zero Mass Water’s technology is now being used in schools, homes and businesses more than 35 countries, but the Atauro project is one of the first to be designed to serve an entire community’s drinking needs.
“We hope that there is a lot of scope to replicate and expand in surrounding parts of the region,” said Bartrop.

315,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/holidays-bring-phishing-scam-surge-aimed-at-small-business/,"NEW YORK: The email looked legitimate, so Danielle Radin clicked on the link it contained, expecting to have her products included in a holiday gift guide.
“I instantly regretted it,” says Radin, owner of Mantra Magnets, a website that sells wellness products. “It took me to some random website that looked like those pop-ups telling you that you’ve won the lottery.”
Within days of that click three weeks ago, Radin began getting notifications that people in Ecuador, China and elsewhere were trying to access her email account. She wasn’t surprised; she knew her San Diego-based small business had been the target of a phishing scam.
While cybercriminals strike at any time of the year, they’re particularly active during the holiday and income tax filing seasons when computer users expect to see more emails — and scammers are increasingly targeting individual small businesses with phishing scams, sending messages that look legitimate but do harm instead. An unsuspecting owner or employee clicks on a link or attachment and like Radin finds that malicious software has invaded their PCs.
Cybersecurity experts find that criminals who used to blanket thousands of computer users in hopes of fooling a handful have refined their methods. Scammers find small businesses through websites, social media sites and by combing email address books. They also mine personal data from breaches at retailers and other large companies. Then, using a process called social engineering, they construct emails that increasingly look realistic, as if they truly come from a boss, colleague, friend, potential client or vendor, a bank and even the IRS.
“In the last year or two they’ve been running more professional campaigns,” says Perry Toone, owner of Thexyz, an email service provider based in Toronto. “It can take a couple of minutes for me to determine that they’re phishing scams. That tells me they’re doing a very good job.”
Radin believes the scammers found her through her website or a blog. Like many small businesses, she has an email address on her site, and the scammers figured out that she might be interested in selling via a holiday gift guide. But finding a target is one thing; the scam won’t work unless it tricks an email recipient into clicking. Even those who are tech savvy can sometimes let their guard down. Radin was duped even though she’s the author of “Everyone’s Been Hacked,” a book sold online.
Often a scam succeeds because there’s just a shred of doubt in a computer user — the email is realistic enough that an owner or employee feels they need to read it. Sometimes a staffer clicks out of fear or a sense of responsibility, says Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College.
“It might not sound very personal, but you have an idea that you should go ahead — you feel like the email is coming from the boss,” he says.
Computer users may not be looking as closely as they should at an email — there can be subtle signs that a message is trouble. Terry Cole, owner of Cole Informatics, a company whose work includes cybersecurity, recalls getting an email that truly seemed to be from a colleague. He was one of several people in the industry to receive it.
“It said that this colleague had sent me a secure private message that was ready for me to read and included a link to click. This was absolutely consistent with my normal experiences communicating with him,” says Cole, whose company is located in Parsons, Tennessee.
Cole didn’t do in that instance what he usually does and advises everyone to do: check the email address to be sure it’s completely correct. When he clicked on the link, it took him to a bogus website claiming to be connected with Microsoft and asking him for his ID and password. He went no further and suffered no damage to his PC.
The holidays provide scammers with extra opportunities: emailed greeting cards, package shipment notices, offers of discounts — all of them false. Cybercriminals also seek personal information from owners and employees under the guise of needing them to create a W-2 or 1099 tax form; at this time of year, business owners’ thoughts are turning to taxes.
“Something that claims to know you, your name, where you work and wants you to take some action is harder to spot,” says Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company based in Sunnyvale, California.
A common scam at holiday time is an email purportedly from the boss telling a staffer to go buy gift cards and email the numbers back, DeGrippo says.
“When it appears to come from a boss or CEO, I think there is that tendency among employees to follow those directions. They’re playing on their emotions,” she says.
Often, a scam succeeds in getting an employee to click on a personal email while on a company PC — many workers check their personal email while at work. Even though the email came through on a personal message, it’s the company’s machine that can be infected.
Companies can protect themselves in part by restricting employees’ access to personal email sites, Telang says. He also suggests seminars to help staffers understand the risks that even legitimate-looking emails can present.
Some of the scams aim at monitoring a user’s keystrokes. So anyone accessing a company or personal account of any sort can be giving a criminal access to their money or sensitive personal data. One tool to prevent a bank account from being emptied or a credit card maxed out is to have accounts with multifactor authentication; that requires a password and a separate code sent to a different device and that is different for each login.

316,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-co-founders-step-aside-as-pichai-takes-helm-of-parent-alphabet/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google co–founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping aside as leaders of the Internet behemoth they founded 21 years ago, ending an extraordinary run that saw them build one of the world’s most valuable and influential companies.
Trusted lieutenant Sundar Pichai, who has run the core Google search business since 2015, will immediately take the reins as CEO of parent Alphabet Inc.
“While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it’s time to assume the role of proud parents — offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!” Page and Brin wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.
Page, Brin and Pichai have shared an emphasis on developing artificial intelligence software to make web searching faster and more personalised, while expanding the range of information and services available from a simple text query.
But their vision faces unprecedented scrutiny, with governments on five continents demanding better safeguards, an end to what many view as anticompetitive conduct, and more taxes from the world’s largest online advertising company. Thousands of employees have protested, and some have even resigned, over ongoing concern that Google‘s famous “don’t be evil” mantra – once embraced by Page and Brin – may be cracking.
Streamlining Alphabet‘s unorthodox management structure could help the company better respond to the challenges and focus on growing profits, investors said.
“This signals a shift away from the more fringy efforts … and more towards a company focused on technology that makes money,” said Kim Caughey Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
Alphabet, which owns more than a dozen companies including self-driving car business Waymo and health care software company Verily, was created in 2015 as part of a restructuring. The Google unit retained control of major businesses including video giant YouTube, the Android smartphone software and hardware operations, and cloud computing.
Page had wanted to focus on developing the newer businesses, which collectively lose money. He left Google, by far the biggest and most profitable part of Alphabet, to Pichai, who in turn delegates a lot of authority to deputies who manage the various product lines. Brin had stayed on as Alphabet‘s president, spending time on robotics, health ventures and other research projects.
But Page and Brin, once regular sights at public events and at Google headquarters, had become much less visible in recent years. Page’s retreat into the background drew increasing criticism from employees and US lawmakers, who demanded answers from him rather than Pichai about controversial projects such as an experimental search app for Chinese users.
Page and Brin, both 46, remain directors of the parent company but will cede their respective CEO and president titles immediately, Alphabet said. The president role will not be filled, it said, describing the changes as long discussed.
Page’s voice has been impaired for years because of a chronic condition, but his health did not play a role in the decision to step aside, Alphabet said.
“With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it’s the natural time to simplify our management structure,” the co–founders said. “We are deeply committed to Google and Alphabet for the long term.”
The co–founders still control the company through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26.1% of Alphabet‘s total voting power, Brin 25.25% and Pichai less than 1%. Alphabet shares rose 0.56% following the after-hours announcement to $1,302.
‘MOONSHOTS’ AND REGULATORS
Page and Brin developed the core Google search technology while they were still graduate students at Stanford, and it quickly proved far superior to competing search engines of the early Internet era.
By the time it went public in 2004, Google dominated Web search and was on its way to becoming a household name and the most powerful force in the global advertising business. The young co–founders also nurtured a free-wheeling, engineering-driven culture that became a model in Silicon Valley, which is littered with startups launched by Google veterans.
Pichai, 47, who has spent 15 years at Google, rose to prominence while leading the development of Google‘s Chrome browser. He later led product development and engineering across all of Google‘s services for a year before gaining the CEO title.
Page and Brin are active in a range of non-Google ventures. Page funded a company attempting to develop flying cars, and Brin at a conference last year discussed a budding interest in cryptocurrency. The Alphabet structure was designed in part to let them pursue new “moonshot” projects.
Investors and regulators, however, were never completely sold.
Alphabet had used the separation between Page’s and Pichai‘s roles to defend its limited financial disclosures about YouTube and other large Google businesses when the practice was questioned by US securities regulators in 2017.
It contended that publicly reported financial results were in line with what Page reviewed as Alphabet CEO. Regulators did not take further action, but the company’s stance has frustrated investors trying to evaluate its performance.
Alphabet declined to comment on whether public financial reporting would change with Pichai assuming both CEO positions.

317,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/for-babies-born-with-hiv-start-treatment-right-away-study/,"WASHINGTON: When babies are born with HIV, starting treatment within hours to days is better than waiting even the few weeks to months that’s the norm in many countries, researchers reported Wednesday.
The findings, from a small but unique study in Botswana, could influence care in Africa and other regions hit hard by the virus. They also might offer a clue in scientists’ quest for a cure.
The Harvard-led team found super early treatment limits how HIV takes root in a newborn’s body, shrinking the “reservoir” of virus that hides out, ready to rebound if those youngsters ever stop their medications.
“We don’t think the current intervention is itself curative, but it sets the stage” for future attempts, said Dr Daniel Kuritzkes of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who co-authored the study.
Giving pregnant women a cocktail of anti-HIV drugs can prevent them from spreading the virus to their unborn children, a step that has dramatically reduced the number of babies born with the virus worldwide. Still, some 300 to 500 infants are estimated to be infected every day in sub-Saharan Africa.
Doctors have long known that treating babies in the first weeks to months of life is important, because their developing immune systems are especially vulnerable to HIV. But an infant dubbed the “Mississippi baby” raised a critical question: Should treatment start even earlier? The girl received a three-drug combination within 30 hours of her birth in July 2010, highly unusual for the time. Her family quit treatment when she was a toddler — yet her HIV remained in remission for a remarkable 27 months before she relapsed and restarted therapy.
The Botswana study was one of several funded by the US National Institutes of Health after doctors learned of the Mississippi baby, to further explore very early treatment.
The findings are encouraging, said Dr Deborah Persaud, a pediatric HIV specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the Botswana study but helped evaluate the Mississippi baby.
“The study showed what we hypothesized happened in the Mississippi baby, that very early treatment really prevents establishment of these long-lived reservoir cells that currently are the barrier to HIV eradication,” Persaud said.
She cautioned: “Very early treatment is important, but prevention should still be our top priority.”
In Botswana, researchers tested at-risk newborns, enrolling 40 born with HIV, treating them within hours to a few days, and tracking them for two years. On Wednesday, they reported results from the first 10 patients, comparing them with 10 infants getting regular care — treatment beginning when they were a few months old.
Medication brought HIV under control in both groups. But the children treated earliest had a much smaller reservoir of HIV in their blood, starting about six months into treatment, the researchers reported in Science Translational Medicine.
The earliest-treated children also got another benefit: more normal functioning of some key parts of the immune system.
One big question: Did the HIV reservoir shrink enough to make a long-term difference? To find out, next year the researchers will give these children experimental antibodies designed to help keep HIV in check, and test how they fare with a temporary stop to their anti-HIV drugs.
In the US, Europe and South Africa, it’s becoming common to test at-risk infants at birth. But in most lower-income countries, babies aren’t tested until they’re 4 to 6 weeks old, said study co-author Dr. Roger Shapiro, a Harvard infectious disease specialist.

318,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/web-inventor-has-an-ambitious-plan-to-take-back-the-net/,"World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee released an ambitious rule book for online governance — a bill of rights and obligations for the internet — designed to counteract the growing prevalence of such anti-democratic poisons as misinformation, mass surveillance and censorship.
The product of a year’s work by the World Wide Web Foundation where Berners-Lee is a founding director, the “ Contract for the Web ” seeks commitments from governments and industry to make and keep knowledge freely available — a digital policy agenda true to the design vision of the 30-year-old web.
The contract is non-binding, however. And funders and partners in the endeavour include Google and Facebook, whose data-collecting business models and sensation-rewarding algorithms have been blamed for exacerbating online toxicity.
“We haven’t had a fairly complex, fairly complete plan of action for the web going forward,” Berners-Lee said in an interview. “This is the first time we’ve had a rule book in which responsibility is being shared.”
For instance, the contract proposes a framework for protecting online privacy and personal data with clearly defined national laws that give individuals greater control over the data collected about them. Independent, well-resourced regulators would offer the public effective means for redress. Current laws and institutions don’t measure up to that standard.
Amnesty International just released a report charging that Google and Facebook’s business models are predicated on the abuse of human rights.
Berners-Lee nevertheless says that “having them in the room is really important.” He said both companies had approached the foundation seeking participation.
“We feel that companies and governments deserve equal seats at the table and understanding where they’re coming from is equally valuable,” he said. “To have this conversation around a table without the tech companies, it just wouldn’t have the clout and we wouldn’t have ended up with the insights.”
The nonprofit foundation’s top donors include the Swedish, Canadian and US governments and the Ford and Omidyar foundations.
One of its biggest challenges is the growing balkanization of the internet, with national governments led by China, Russia and Iran exerting increasing technical control over their domestic networks, tightening censorship and surveillance.
“The trend for balkanization is really worrying and it’s extreme at the moment in Iran,” said Berners-Lee. A strong government exhibits tolerance, the computer scientist added, for “other voices, opposition voices, foreign voices to be heard by its citizens.”
So how to prevent governments from restricting internet access at their borders?
One approach, said Berners-Lee, could be financial pressure. Multinational lenders could condition lower interest rates, for example, on a nation’s willingness to let information flow freely on its domestic network.

319,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-reins-in-political-advertising/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google is making it harder for political advertisers to target specific types of people.
The company said that as of January, advertisers will only be able to target US political ads based on broad categories such as gender, age and postal code. Currently, ads can be tailored for more specific groups — for instance, using information gleaned from public voter logs, such as political affiliation.
The change will take effect in the UK in the next week, before the general election, and in the European Union before the end of 2019. It will apply everywhere else in early January.
Google reiterated that ads making false claims are prohibited, adding that so-called deepfakes — realistic but false video clips — are not allowed. Neither are “demonstrably false” claims that could affect voter trust in an election.
But in a blog post announcing the news, Google Ads vice president Scott Spencer noted that political dialogue is important and “no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim and insinuation.”
“So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited — but we will continue to do so for clear violations,” he wrote.
Like all Google ads, political advertisers can also use the broader practice of “contextual targeting,” which involves placing ads about, say, climate change on articles about the environment.
The company is also requiring advertiser verification for a broader range of political messages. Previously, only ads mentioning candidates or officeholders for federal positions required verification. Now that will also include ads touching on state officials and candidates as well as ballot measures.
The move follows Twitter’s ban on political ads, which goes into effect on Friday.
Twitter also placed restrictions on ads related to social causes such as climate change or abortion.
In these instances, advertisers won’t be able to target those ads down to a user’s ZIP code or use political categories such as “conservative” or “liberal.” Rather, targeting must be kept broad, based on a user’s state or province, for instance.
Facebook has not made sweeping changes to any of its ads policies, but thrust the issue into public discussion this fall when it confirmed it would not remove false or misleading ads by politicians.
Critics have harshly condemned Facebook’s decision. Twitter also faced a backlash from those who found its ban too far-reaching.
Google has taken a more middling stance, but it’s unlikely to please everyone. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s campaign staff took issue with reports that Facebook might consider limiting its targeting practices.
“Facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020,” the campaign tweeted from its official account. “Tools that help us reach more great Americans & lift voices the media & big tech choose to ignore!”
Even Google’s limited targeting could receive backlash.
Critics and civil rights groups have said targeting specific zip codes or other small geographic zones can allow advertisers to discriminate or sway elections.
The expansion to Google’s verification process will take effect December 3.

320,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/amazon-says-its-considered-face-scanning-in-ring-doorbells/,"Amazon has considered adding facial recognition technology to its Ring doorbell cameras, according to a letter to a US senator defending its video-sharing partnerships with police.
The company told Senator Ed Markey that facial recognition is a “contemplated, but unreleased feature” of its home security cameras but that there are no plans to coordinate that feature with its law enforcement partnerships.
Markey wrote to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in September raising privacy and civil liberty concerns about Ring’s video-sharing agreements with police departments across the country. The company encourages police to tap into Ring’s Neighbors app, a forum for residents to share videos of suspicious activity captured by their home security cameras.

The Massachusetts Democrat also expressed alarm that Ring may be pursuing face-scanning technology after a patent application showed the company is exploring a system that could flag certain people as suspicious and automatically alert police.
Markey released Amazon’s responses Tuesday.
Amazon’s initial response to Markey said Ring doesn’t currently offer facial recognition. Then Markey sent another letter to Bezos asking why it’s mentioned in Ring’s privacy policy. In a Nov. 1 follow-up, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, Brian Huseman, said that the company frequently innovates based on customer demand and that facial recognition is an increasingly common feature in cameras made by competitors such as Google’s Nest division.
“If our customers want these features in Ring security cameras, we will only release these features with thoughtful design including privacy, security, and user control,” Huseman wrote.
Markey’s questions about facial recognition were part of broader concerns that some lawmakers and civil liberties advocates have about Ring and its police partnerships. Amazon sought to address those concerns in its letters to Markey, emphasizing that camera owners have a choice about whether to share videos. The company noted that police aren’t allowed to seek recordings that are longer than 12 hours in duration or that cover a geographical area that is too specific or broad.
But Amazon also said it doesn’t require law enforcement to delete a user’s video footage after a certain period. Nor would it entertain Markey’s request that it commit to never selling users’ biometric information, saying only that it doesn’t do so now.
Markey said Tuesday that Amazon is not doing enough to ensure that its products don’t run afoul of civil liberties.
“Connected doorbells are well on their way to becoming a mainstay of American households, and the lack of privacy and civil rights protections for innocent residents is nothing short of chilling,” he said in a statement.
“If you’re an adult walking your dog or a child playing on the sidewalk, you shouldn’t have to worry that Ring’s products are amassing footage of you and that law enforcement may hold that footage indefinitely or share that footage with any third parties,” he added.
More than 600 police departments have signed up to Ring’s network since last year and many say it is becoming a useful crime-fighting tool. Among them is the police chief of Markey’s hometown of Malden, Massachusetts. Chief Kevin Molis said he is Markey’s neighbor and has known him since the 1970s but disagrees with him about Ring.
“We consider it a valuable tool for public safety,” Molis said in an interview. “Is it a bad thing that private citizens, in order to make their streets safer, are investing their own money in a product that’s allowing crimes to be solved and crimes to be prevented?”
But staff attorney Mohammad Tajsar of the ACLU of Southern California said Amazon’s responses to Markey raise grave privacy concerns. Amazon told Markey it has no way of knowing if its cameras are collecting personal data from children or positioned in such a way that they’re intruding on a neighbor’s privacy.
“Even if you don’t sell data, or provide data to law enforcement, you’re creating a mechanism whereby people can express latent biases and racism and classism in a portal that encourages it,” Tajsar said.

321,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/china-tests-mars-lander-in-international-cooperation-push/,"HUAILAI: China invited international observers to a Thursday test of its Mars lander as it pushes for inclusion in more global space projects.
The demonstration of hovering, obstacle avoidance and deceleration capabilities was conducted at a site outside Beijing simulating conditions on the Red Planet, where the pull of gravity is about one-third that of Earth.
China plans to launch a lander and rover to Mars next year to explore parts of the planet in detail.
China’s burgeoning space program achieved a lunar milestone earlier this year by landing a probe on the mysterious far side of the moon.

It has developed rapidly, especially since it conducted its first crewed mission in 2003 and has sought cooperation with space agencies from Europe and elsewhere.
The US, however, has banned most space cooperation with China out of national security concerns, keeping China from participating in the International Space Station.
Despite that, China’s ambitions continue to grow as it seeks to rival the US, Russia and Europe in space and cement its position as a regional and global power.
Guests at Thursday’s event came from 19 countries and included the ambassadors of Brazil, France and Italy.
“This event is the first public appearance of China’s Mars exploration mission, also an important measure for China to pragmatically carry out space international exchanges and cooperation,” the China National Space Administration said in a news release.

322,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/should-people-be-paid-for-sharing-their-personal-data-online/,"
LONDON: From tagging photos on Facebook to driving with Google Maps, people should join forces in “data unions” to demand payment for letting online tools collect their data, according to an economist advocating for radical reforms to improve society.
Glen Weyl, a principal researcher at the research arm of US tech giant Microsoft, said people have been “fooled” into handing over data that is then used in artificial intelligence (AI) to copy human behaviour and possibly eliminate some jobs.
“Humans are doing all this work and then we are being told that we are doing nothing, that we play no role, and that these systems are just going to automate us away. This is profoundly dishonest,” Weyl told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“We need to respect the fact that those data are actually being created by the very people who these companies are claiming are no longer relevant. And we need to acknowledge that by compensating them.”
While getting paid for tagging photos on Instagram or uploading to YouTube might sound way off, the idea has been gaining some traction in the United States as tech giants from Google, to Facebook and Twitter, face increased scrutiny over the way they handle personal information.
Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang has said people should receive a share of the economic value generated from their data, while the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, recently proposed companies should pay a “data dividend”.
Weyl said the amount people would get is a matter of debate but it would, in general, depend on the size of the economy that becomes automated, with people getting more money the more jobs are taken over by artificial intelligence thanks to their data.
Estimates vary from $500 a year in a present-day scenario, to $20,000 some 15 years down the line, when some projections say a third of all jobs will be done by computers, he said.
Yet, single users are unlikely to get a penny unless they organise in “data unions” similarly to what workers did during the industrial revolution, said Weyl, a speaker at the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s annual Trust Conference on Thursday.
“People get paid for completing surveys, or putting television boxes in their home that monitor how they watch television,” he said.
“The problem is that the ability of people to receive reasonable and fair compensation for what they do online is undermined by the fact that all these other people are consenting to do it for free.”
Unions could bring together users with specific sets of data, like on travel or shopping habits, and bargain a better price for it, said Weyl, who co-authored the 2018 book “Radical Markets” with legal scholar Eric Posner.
They could also help address privacy concerns by restricting what information is collected and how it is used, he added.
Some early versions of data unions already exist.
US start-up Datacoup offers users a platform to monetise their data, while Dutch group ‘Datavakbond’, or “data labour union”, was set up in 2018 with the aim of negotiating directly with Facebook and Google over data use.
But Weyl said more people needed to get involved or become vocal about the need for a more equitable system otherwise things could slide in the opposite direction, with a few powerful companies and central states controlling most data.
“We can build alternatives to the worst scenarios but those alternatives are not going to come unless we do it together,” he said.

That means “sky” in the language of the Native American Powhatan people, NASA said Tuesday.

NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew past the snowman-shaped Arrokoth on New Year’s Day, 3 ½ years after exploring Pluto. At the time, this small icy world 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometres) beyond Pluto was nicknamed Ultima Thule given its vast distance from us.
“The name ‘Arrokoth’ reflects the inspiration of looking to the skies,” lead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said in a statement, “and wondering about the stars and worlds beyond our own.”
The name was picked because of the Powhatan’s ties to the Chesapeake Bay region.
New Horizons is operated from Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland. The Hubble Space Telescope — which discovered Arrokoth in 2014 — has its science operations in Baltimore.
The New Horizons team got consent for the name from Powhatan Tribal elders and representatives, according to NASA. The International Astronomical Union and its Minor Planet Center approved the choice.
Arrokoth is among countless objects in the so-called Kuiper Belt, or vast Twilight Zone beyond the orbit of Neptune. New Horizons will observe some of these objects from afar as it makes it’s way deeper into space.

Stargazers used solar-filtered binoculars and telescopes to spot Mercury — a tiny black dot — as it passed directly between Earth and the sun on Monday.
The eastern US and Canada got the whole 5 ½-hour show, weather permitting, along with Central and South America. The rest of the world, except for Asia and Australia, got just a sampling.

Mercury is the solar system’s smallest, innermost planet. The next transit isn’t until 2032, and North America won’t get another shot until 2049.
In Maryland, clouds prevented NASA solar astrophysicist Alex Young from getting a clear peek. Live coverage was provided by observatories including NASA’s orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory.
“It’s a bummer, but the whole event was still great,” Young wrote in an email. “Both getting to see it from space and sharing it with people all over the country and world.”
At Cape Canaveral, space buffs got a two-for-one. As Mercury’s silhouette graced the morning sun, SpaceX launched 60 small satellites for global internet service, part of the company’s growing Starlink constellation in orbit.

326,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/one-big-step-google-buys-fitbit-for-2-1-billion/,"Google, the company that helped make it fun to just sit around surfing the web, is jumping into the fitness-tracker business with both feet, buying Fitbit for about $2.1 billion.
The deal could put Google in direct competition with Apple and Samsung in the highly competitive market for smartwatches and other wearable electronics. But it also raises questions about privacy and Google’s dominance in the tech industry.

The company’s announcement Friday came with a promise that it won’t sell ads using the intimate health data that Fitbit devices collect.
Fitbit is a pioneer in wearable fitness technology, making a range of devices that have become pop-culture accessories, from basic trackers that count how many steps you take each day to smartwatches that display messages and notifications from phones.
They can track activities such as running, cycling and swimming and record heart rates and sleep patterns. Fitbit typically asks for date of birth, gender, height and weight to help with such things as estimating calories burned. Some people use Fitbit’s app to record what they eat and how much water they drink. Women can track their periods.
Fitbit has 28 million active users worldwide and has sold more than 100 million devices.
Google, meanwhile, makes software for use in other manufacturers’ wearable devices, but those products haven’t gained much traction in the face of competition from Fitbit, Apple, Samsung and others. And Google doesn’t sell a device of its own.
The deal to buy Fitbit could give Google a needed boost.
“Google doesn’t want to be left out of the party,” said analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. “If you look at what Apple has done with wearables, it’s a missing piece of the puzzle for Google.”
Google’s pledge that it won’t sell ads using Fitbit health data is a continuation of promises previously made by Fitbit.
Privacy experts, though, were sceptical.
Consumer Reports health privacy expert Dena Mendelsohn said she is concerned that people enrolled in wellness programs through their employers that use Fitbit devices could lose control over their data.
“While a person may not have had concerns about Fitbit holding their data, they may have concerns over Google holding their data,” Mendelsohn said.
Google’s promise is also unlikely to stop it from gathering other information from Fitbit devices.
For example, Fitbit has GPS models that could track users’ locations. That could help Google know that a runner stopped at a coffee shop on the way home. Google could then display ads for rival coffee shops.
More important, having a Google device on the wrist could drive wearers to use Google services, even more, giving the company more ways to sell ads.
The deal is likely to face scrutiny from state and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust authorities, who are already investigating Google and other big tech companies over whether they have abused their market power.
“Why should Google be permitted to acquire even more companies while they’re under DOJ antitrust investigation?” Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, tweeted.
Still, analysts at equity research firm Cowen said they believe regulators are unlikely to block the deal because of Fitbit’s relatively small size and its focus on hardware.
While Fitbit all but created the field, it has been shredded by the competition. It was worth nearly $10 billion after it went public in 2015. But its value this week is well below $2 billion.
When rumours of a potential buyout by Google surfaced earlier this week, Fitbit stock soared almost 30%. It jumped nearly 16% more Friday.
Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet, will pay $7.35 per share. Alphabet stock gained about 1%.
“With Google’s resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone,” Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park said in a statement.
Fitbit has been expanding its partnerships with major health care companies such as Humana to encourage healthier living.
John Hancock announced incentives last year on its insurance policies for people willing to share data gathered by health-monitoring devices. It offers free Fitbits to participants.
Last year, Fitbit acquired a health coaching business that helps people manage conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.
Fitbit ranks fourth in global shipments of digital watches, fitness trackers and other wrist-worn devices, according to research firm IDC. Chinese companies Xiaomi and Huawei were No. 1 and No. 3, Apple was No. 2, and Samsung came in fifth.

Event organisers say their selection of Dubai as host reflects a vote of confidence that this oil-rich Emirati sheikhdom can be a global hub for innovation. They also expressed hope that bringing together tomorrow’s scientists and engineers will help develop technologies to solve the world’s most pressing issues, particularly those related to the environment.
Dean Kamen, founder of first Global Challenge, said the Middle East represents a part of the world where “the adults have not learned how to play nice with each other” and it was up to young people to fix humanity’s self-inflicted wounds.
“We are in an accelerating race toward catastrophe, whether it’s global warning, melting of the (polar ice) caps, bird flu, terrorism — you name it, we’re worried about it. The solution to most of the world’s grand challenges depends on better technologies than we have today,” he said.
“This globe of ours is on life support, so the thought is we get every kid in every country to focus on learning how to use technology, but focus on using it as a tool and not a weapon,” he explained.
The unofficial “Robotics Olympics” seeks to encourage young people to pursue subjects known as STEM — science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Teams of four to five students, aged 14-18, each received a kit of rods, wheels, wires and other raw materials with which to assemble their roving robots. Their task: Collect orange balls of various sizes from a playing field, which represented human-created pollutants in the ocean. Some devised robots for scooping, while others snatched up and fired the balls through the air into the receptacles.
The teams then formed “alliances,” each with up of four nations, to battle their way to the final round. Overall, 1,500 students took part.
A team captained by Belarus, and including Syrian refugees, eventually won the gold medal, edging out a team captained by Israel in a dramatic final match. But organisers stressed a message of unity, not conflict.
“The kids get it. To them this isn’t a competition; this is a ‘coop-etition.’ This is a celebration of technology,” said Kamen.
Previous events tackled challenges related to clean water access and sustainable energy.
Robotics is a natural fit for Dubai, a city that’s already testing driverless cars and taxis. It’s become a magnet for international entrepreneurs, with an entire zone called “Internet City” that’s packed with high-tech startups. Next October, Dubai will host the Expo 2020, welcoming technological breakthroughs from around the world.
“If we are to become the city of the future, we need to have the right talent from around the world,” said Omar Al-Olama, the 29-year-old Emirati Minister of Artificial Intelligence, the world’s first such minister. “Artificial intelligence is based on data. Data is what drives all these new technologies. We have the holy grail of data. We have 200 nationalities represented in this country.”
FedEx recently announced Dubai would become the first city outside the US to test Roxo, an autonomous delivery device that can travel on sidewalks and even unpaved surfaces.
Roxo made its debut international appearance at this week’s robotics contest, drawing the interest of the tech-savvy teens hailing from places as diverse as Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. They mingled in Dubai’s Festival City, exchanging experiences and forming friendships while talking shop about their gadgets.
“We didn’t do so well in the matches because we had a lot of trouble with the control hub, but it doesn’t matter, we had a lot of fun,” said Stefan Sijbesma, 17, from the Netherlands. “For me, robotics is really important because it really helped me choose what I want to study and what I want to do with my life.”
The three-day tournament had a festival-like atmosphere to it, with announcers and commentators analysing the action in sports-broadcast style and fans waving flags and banners supporting their teams. The pavilion floor was filled with facts about the millions of tons of pollutants threatening the world’s oceans, and featured slogans such as “united by land, connected by oceans” and “together we turn the tide on pollution.”
As the nail-biting results were being announced, the Israelis huddled with their Ugandan teammates before embracing the winning team in a feel-good ending.
“I can’t believe it, it’s a miracle,” said Yamen Najjar, manager of Team Hope, which represents the Syrian refugees and was part of the winning alliance. “It was a very difficult competition for us, we faced a lot of problems, but we didn’t lose hope.”
Outgoing US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who’d made the original announcement that Dubai would host the event earlier this year in a surprise visit to the World Government Summit, was on hand. Perry said he’s followed the robotics tournaments since 2002 when, as governor of Texas, he attended one of the regional competitions in Houston and was “blown away” by the passions and abilities of the young contestants.
But he said he found their camaraderie even more impressive.
“It is stunning what these young people are doing,” Perry said. “Where the adults may have failed in the standpoint of international diplomacy, these young people may accomplish, and if that’s the case maybe that is the most important thing that comes out of this.”

The 25-year-old university dropout Boyan Slat founded The Ocean Cleanup to develop and deploy a system he invented when he was 18 that catches plastic waste floating in the ocean.
On Saturday he unveiled the next step in his fight: A floating solar-powered device that he calls the “Interceptor” that scoops plastic out of rivers as it drifts past.
“We need to close the tap, which means preventing more plastic from reaching the ocean in the first place,” he said, calling rivers “the arteries that carry the trash from land to sea.”
Slat’s organisation has in the past drawn criticism for focusing only on the plastic trash already floating in the world’s oceans. Experts say 9 million tons (8 million metric tons) of plastic waste, including plastic bottles, bags, toys and other items, flows annually into the ocean from beaches, rivers and creeks, endangering marine life in the oceans, including whales.
Three of the machines have already been deployed to Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam — and a fourth is heading to the Dominican Republic, he said.
Izham Hashim from the government of Selangor state in Malaysia was present at the launch and said he was happy with the machine.
“It has been used for 1 1/2 months in the river and it’s doing very well, collecting the plastic bottles and all the rubbish,” he said.
Slat said he believes 1,000 rivers are responsible for some 80% of plastic pouring into the world’s oceans and he wants to tackle them all in the next five years.
“This is not going to be easy, but imagine if we do get this done,” he told his audience of enthusiastic supporters, who whooped, clapped and cheered his announcements. “We could truly make our oceans clean again.”
Slat used his live-streamed unveiling to appeal for support from countries committing to clean up their rivers and businesses prepared to inject funding and help with the operation of the devices.
The vessel is designed to be moored in rivers and has a shaped nose to deflect away larger floating debris like tree trunks. The interceptors work by guiding plastic waste into an opening in its bow, a conveyor belt then carries the trash into the guts of the machine where it is dropped into dumpsters. The interceptor sends a text message to local operators that can come and empty it when it’s full.
Slat showed off how it worked by dumping hundreds of yellow rubber ducks into the water at the launch event in Rotterdam’s port. The interceptor caught nearly all of them.
The machines currently cost about 700,000 euros ($775,600), but Slat said the cost will likely drop as production increases.
Jan van Franeker of the Wageningen Marine Research Institute has been critical of The Ocean Cleanup in the past, but said the new device looks promising.
“I am really happy they finally moved toward the source of the litter,” he said in a telephone interview. “The design, from what I can see, looks pretty good.”
Slat argued that the economic impact of not picking plastic out of rivers is higher than the cost of buying and using the machines.
“Deploying interceptors is even cheaper than deploying nothing at all,” he said.

329,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-plans-to-send-water-hunting-robot-to-moon-surface-in-2022/,"WASHINGTON: NASA will send a golf cart-sized robot to the moon in 2022 to search for deposits of water below the surface, an effort to evaluate the vital resource ahead of a planned human return to the moon in 2024 to possibly use it for astronauts to drink and to make rocket fuel, the US space agency said on Friday.
The VIPER robot will drive for miles (km) on the dusty lunar surface to get a closer look at what NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine has touted for months: underground pockets of “hundreds of millions of tons of water ice” that could help turn the moon into a jumping-off point to Mars.
“VIPER is going to assess where the water ice is. We’re going to be able to characterize the water ice, and ultimately drill,” Bridenstine said on Friday at the International Astronautical Congress in Washington. “Why is this important? Because water ice represents something significant. Life support.”
VIPER stands for Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover.
The rover is expected to arrive on the moon‘s south polar region in December 2022, carrying four instruments to sample lunar soil for traces of hydrogen and oxygen – the basic components of water that can be separated and synthesized into fuel for a planned fleet of commercial lunar launch vehicles.
In development at NASA‘s Ames Research Center in California, the VIPER robot will log “about 100 days of data that will be used to inform the first global water resource maps of the moon,” NASA said in announcing the plans.
NASA is in the process of kickstarting its Artemis program, an accelerated mission to put people back on the moon for the first time since the 1970s to train and prove technologies that would later be sent on a Mars mission.
Scientists have eyed lunar water as a key resource for enabling long-duration astronaut missions on the moon, though its form and exact amount are unknown. VIPER will aim to find out.
NASA crashed a rocket onto the moon‘s south pole in 2009 to confirm traces of lunar water ice in the plume of dust kicked up upon impact.

330,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/facebook-launches-a-news-section/,"
Over the course of its 15 year history, Facebook has variously ignored news organisations while eating their advertising revenue, courted them for video projects it subsequently abandoned, and then largely cut their stories out of its newsfeeds.
Now it plans to pay them for news headlines — reportedly millions of dollars in some cases.
Enter the “News Tab,” a new section in the Facebook mobile app that will display headlines — and nothing else — from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, Business Insider, NBC, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times, among others. Local stories from several of the largest US cities will also make the grade; headlines from smaller towns are on their way, Facebook says.
Tapping on those headlines will take you directly to publisher websites or apps, if you have any installed. Which is more or less what publishers have been requesting from Facebook for years.
It’s potentially a big step for a platform that has long struggled with both stamping out misinformation and making nice with struggling purveyors of news. Though media watchers remain skeptical that Facebook is really committed to helping sustain the news industry.
Facebook declined to say who is getting paid and how much, saying only that it will be paying “a range of publishers for access to all of their content.” Just last year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wasn’t sure it “makes sense ” to pay news outlets for their material.
But now, as Zuckerberg told The Associated Press in an interview, “there’s an opportunity to set up new long term, stable financial relationships with publishers.”
News executives have long been unhappy about the extent to which digital giants like Facebook make use of their stories — mostly by displaying headlines and short summaries when users post news links. A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress this year would grant an antitrust exemption to news companies, letting them band together to negotiate payments from the big tech platforms.
“It’s a good direction that they’re willing for the first time to value and pay for news content,” said David Chavern, head of the News Media Alliance, a publisher trade group. “The trouble is that most publishers aren’t included.”
Zuckerberg said Facebook aims to set up partnerships with a “wide range” of publishers.
“We think that this is an opportunity to build something quite meaningful here,” he said. “We’re going to have journalists curating this, we are really focused on provenance and branding and where the stories come from.”
In a statement, the Los Angeles Times said it expects the Facebook effort will help expand its readership and digital subscribers.
Facebook killed its previous effort to curate news, the ill-fated Trending topics, in 2018. Conservatives complained about political bias, leading Facebook to fire its human editors and automate the section until it began recycling false stories, after which the social giant shut it down entirely.
But what happens when the sprawling social network plays news editor? An approach that sends people news based on what they’ve liked before could over time elevate stories with greater “emotional resonance” over news that “allows public discourse to take place,” said Edward Wasserman, dean of the graduate journalism program at the University of California-Berkeley.
“It deepens my concern that they’ll be applying Facebook logic to news judgment,” he added.
The social network has come under criticism for its news judgment recently. In September, it removed a fact-check from Science Feedback that called out an anti-abortion activist’s video for claiming that abortion is never medically necessary. Republican senators had complained about the fact check.
Facebook says a small team of “seasoned” journalists it employs will choose the headlines for the “Today’s Story” section of the tab, designed to “catch you up” on the day’s news. The rest of the news section will be populated with stories algorithmically based on users’ interests.
That sounds similar to the approach taken by Apple News , a free iPhone app. But Apple’s effort to contract with news organisations has been slow to take off. Apple News Plus, a $10-a-month paid version, remains primarily a hub for magazines; other news publishers have largely sat it out.
Apple’s service reportedly offered publishers only half the revenue it pulled in from subscriptions, divided according to how popular publishers were with readers.

331,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/fossil-trove-shows-lifes-fast-recovery-after-big-extinction/,"NEW YORK: A remarkable trove of fossils from Colorado has revealed details of how mammals grew larger and plants evolved after the cataclysm that killed the dinosaurs.
The thousands of specimens let scientists trace that history over a span of 1 million years, a mere eyeblink in Earth’s lifespan.
Sixty-six million years ago, a large meteorite smashed into what is now the Yucatan Peninsula of southeastern Mexico. It unleashed broiling waves of heat and filled the sky with aerosols that blotted out the sun for months, killing off plants and the animals that depended on them.
More than three-quarters of species on Earth died out.
But life came back, and land mammals began to expand from being small creatures into the wide array of forms we see today — including us.
So the new find taps into “the origin of the modern world,” said Tyler Lyson, an author of a paper reporting the fossil finds Thursday in the journal Science.
The fossils were recovered from an area of steep bluffs covering about 10 square miles (17 square kilometres) near Colorado Springs, starting three years ago.
Lyson, of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, found little in that area when he followed the standard practice of scanning for bits of bone. But that changed when he began looking instead for rocks that can form around bone. When the rocks were broken open, skulls and other fossils within were revealed.
Lyson said it’s not clear how wide a geographic region the fossils’ story of recovery applies to, but that he thinks they show what happened over North America.
“We just know so little about this everywhere on the globe,” he said. “At least now we have at one spot a fantastic record.”

Experts not connected to the study were enthusiastic.
It’s “an unparalleled documentary of how life on land recovered” after the asteroid impact, said P. David Polly of Indiana University in Bloomington. “The sheer number of fossil specimens and the quality of their preservation are exceptional” for this time period, he said.
The fossils’ story certainly represents what happened in central North America and perhaps more broadly, he wrote in an email.
Stephanie Smith of the Field Museum in Chicago said the study’s detailed focus on a single area can help scientists understand the complexity of recovery when combined with results from elsewhere.
Scientists have previously found little evidence about what happened in the aftermath of the meteorite crash, especially on land, said Jin Meng of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The new work, he said in an email, appears to provide “the best record on Earth to date.”
The study reports on hundreds of mammal fossils representing 16 species and more than 6,000 plant fossils. Researchers also analyzed thousands of pollen grains to see what plants were alive at various times. Analysis of leaves indicated several warming periods during the period.
Here’s the recovery story the fossils tell:
The area had been a forest before the meteorite hit, home to dinosaurs like T. rex and mammals no bigger than about 17 pounds (8 kilograms).
Soon after the disaster, the environment was blanketed with ferns and the biggest mammal around was about as heavy as a rat. The world was in a warming period, as documented in previous studies.
By about 100,000 years after the meteorite impact, the forest was dominated by palm trees and mammals had grown to the weight of raccoons, almost as big as before the meteorite crash. “That’s a pretty rapid recovery, or at least one aspect of recovery,” Lyson said.
By 300,000 years, the walnut tree family had diversified, and the biggest mammals were plant eaters about as heavy as a large beaver. Based on other studies of their diet, they may have evolved along with those trees, Lyson said.
By 700,000 years, the fossil record shows the first known appearance of legume plants, the family that includes peas and beans. And it reveals the two largest mammals found in the study, with the larger one weighing about 100 pounds (50 kilograms), roughly like a wolf. That is about 100 times heavier than the mammals that survived the extinction, “which I think is pretty fast” for growth, Lyson said.
What drove mammals to get bigger? The main factor was the disappearance of the dinosaurs, leaving an ecological niche to be filled, he said. But the quality and types of food on the landscape probably also played a role, he said. The simultaneous appearance of legume plants and bigger mammals suggests the plants may have provided a “protein bar moment,” Lyson said.
He said the mammals were creatures that evolved from animals that had survived extinction or those that immigrated from elsewhere.
Zhe-Xi Luo of the University of Chicago, who did not participate in the work, said the report is remarkable for tying together records for plants, mammals and temperature, giving a “holistic picture.”
Scientists expected mammals to recover after the dinosaur extinctions, he said, and the new work “is a huge step forward in getting a firm understanding about just how it happened.”

Able to crack random number problem in minutes
Breakthrough compared to first manned flight
IBM : Google hypes achievement, risks misleading public

BERLIN/SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Wednesday it had achieved a breakthrough in computing research by using a quantum computer to solve in minutes a complex problem that would take today’s most powerful supercomputer thousands of years to crack.

Google researchers expect that quantum computers within a few years will fuel advancements in fields such as artificial intelligence, materials science, and chemistry. The company is racing rivals including IBM Corp and Microsoft Corp to be the first to commercialize the technology and sell it through its cloud computing business.
“We’re hoping that when people start using this and looking at performance stability and cloud interface, they’ll get really excited about what we have to offer at Google,” John Martinis, the company’s chief scientist for quantum hardware, told reporters.
The breakthrough was described in a paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5#Sec4 published in science journal Nature. It followed weeks of controversy since a draft leaked over whether Google‘s claim of “quantum supremacy” was valid.
IBM said a supercomputer employing a different set-up could solve the same challenge in under three days, while chipmaker Intel said “quantum practicality” remained years away.
Google defended its position, but did not dispute rivals’ contentions. It has manufactured a handful of chips with 54 ‘qubits’, vastly more powerful than the standard 64-bit chip in many consumer devices. However, for the technology to be useful to customers it would need to make chips with thousands of qubits.
Martinis said Google sees “a pathway” to a computer with 1,000 qubits and expressed confidence that it had a reliable process to make its new chip, dubbed Sycamore.
The US and Chinese governments have led in the burgeoning quantum technology field, pledging billions of dollars in funding to corporate and state researchers to fast-track quantum development and mitigate possible issues, including the tech’s expected ability to break digital encryption.
Google has been among the beneficiaries of the American support. “The United States has taken a great leap forward in quantum computing,” said U.S. chief technology officer Michael Kratsios on Wednesday.

Long-held dream

For decades, computer scientists have sought to harness quantum physics, laws governing the behavior of particles that are smaller than atoms and can simultaneously exist in different states.
Quantum bits, or qubits, can be set to one and zero at the same time, unlike today’s computer bits that are either ones or zeros. This superposition property multiplies exponentially as qubits become entangled with each other, meaning the more qubits connected, the vastly more powerful a quantum computer becomes.
But there is a catch: Quantum researchers need to cool qubits to about absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius or -460 degrees Fahrenheit) to limit vibration – or “noise” – that causes errors in calculations. It is in this challenging task that Google, which has designed much of its own electronics and used liquid helium for cooling, has made significant progress.
CEO Sundar Pichai compared the achievement to building the first rocket to leave Earth’s atmosphere and touch the edge of space, an advance that brought interplanetary travel into the realm of the possible.
“For those of us working in science and technology, it’s the ‘hello world’ moment we’ve been waiting for – the most meaningful milestone to date in the quest to make quantum computing a reality,” Pichai wrote in a blog https://blog.google/perspectives/sundar-pichai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means.
Sycamore, measuring about 10 mm (0.39 inch) across, is made using aluminum and indium parts sandwiched between two silicon wafers. In their experiment this year, the researchers were able to get 53 of Sycamore’s qubits to interact in a quantum state.
They then had the quantum computer detect patterns in a series of seemingly random numbers, and it succeeded in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. They estimated that the same problem would take 10,000 years for a Summit supercomputer – the most powerful in the world today – to solve.

Hold on a qubit
While the peer-reviewed research has drawn plaudits, with MIT’s William D. Oliver comparing it to the Wright brothers’ first flights, skeptics say Google is over-selling its achievement.
IBM said a supercomputer with additional disk storage can solve the random number problem in at most 2-1/2 days and with greater accuracy. It also said Google risked misleading the public by implying the new-style computers would replace existing ones.
“Quantum computers will never reign ‘supreme’ over classical computers, but will rather work in concert with them, since each have their unique strengths,” Dario Gil, director of research at IBM, wrote in a blog https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy.
Torsten Siebert, manager of the quantum computing research program at Germany’s Fraunhofer Society, agreed that “progress was likely to be achieved through such hybrid combinations.”
Researchers also have expressed concern about quantum computers being used, for example, to unseal secure data and passwords or enable new forms of surveillance.
But before quantum computers can break codes, security experts have plenty of time to adapt, Martinis said.
“We’re pretty confident we’ll all stay safe and secure in the future,” he said.

333,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/is-the-stethoscope-dying-high-tech-rivals-pose-a-threat/,"
CHICAGO: Two centuries after its invention, the stethoscope — the very symbol of the medical profession — is facing an uncertain prognosis.

It is threatened by hand-held devices that are also pressed against the chest but rely on ultrasound technology, artificial intelligence and smartphone apps instead of doctors’ ears to help detect leaks, murmurs, abnormal rhythms and other problems in the heart, lungs and elsewhere. Some of these instruments can yield images of the beating heart or create electrocardiogram graphs.
Dr Eric Topol, a world-renowned cardiologist, considers the stethoscope obsolete, nothing more than a pair of “rubber tubes.”
It “was OK for 200 years,” Topol said. But “we need to go beyond that. We can do better.”
In a longstanding tradition, nearly every US medical school presents incoming students with a white coat and stethoscope to launch their careers. It’s more than symbolic — stethoscope skills are still taught, and proficiency is required for doctors to get their licenses.
Over the last decade, though, the tech industry has downsized ultrasound scanners into devices resembling TV remotes. It has also created digital stethoscopes that can be paired with smartphones to create moving pictures and readouts.

Proponents say these devices are nearly as easy to use as stethoscopes and allow doctors to watch the body in motion and actually see things such as leaky valves. “There’s no reason you would listen to sounds when you can see everything,” Topol said.
At many medical schools, it’s the newer devices that really get students’ hearts pumping.
“Wow!” ”Whoa!” ”This is awesome,” Indiana University medical students exclaimed in a recent class as they learned how to use a hand-held ultrasound device on a classmate, watching images of his lub-dubbing heart on a tablet screen.
The Butterfly iQ device, made by based by Guilford, Connecticut-based Butterfly Network Inc, went on the market last year. An update will include artificial intelligence to help users position the probe and interpret the images.
Students at the Indianapolis-based medical school, one of the nation’s largest, learn stethoscope skills but also get training in hand-held ultrasound in a programme launched there last year by Dr Paul Wallach, an executive associate dean. He created a similar programme five years ago at the Medical College of Georgia and predicts that within the next decade, hand-held ultrasound devices will become part of the routine physical exam, just like the reflex hammer.
The devices advance “our ability to take peek under the skin into the body,” he said. But Wallach added that, unlike some of his colleagues, he isn’t ready to declare the stethoscope dead. He envisions the next generation of physicians wearing “a stethoscope around the neck and an ultrasound in the pocket.”
Modern-day stethoscopes bear little resemblance to the first stethoscope, invented in the early 1800s by Frenchman Rene Laennec, but they work essentially the same way.
Laennec’s creation was a hollow tube of wood, almost a foot long, that made it easier to hear heart and lung sounds than pressing an ear against the chest. Rubber tubes, earpieces and the often cold metal attachment that is placed against the chest came later, helping to amplify the sounds.
When the stethoscope is pressed against the body, sound waves make the diaphragm — the flat metal disc part of the device — and the bell-shaped underside vibrate. That channels the sound waves up through the tubes to the ears. Conventional stethoscopes typically cost under $200, compared with at least a few thousand dollars for some of the high-tech devices.
But picking up and interpreting body sounds is subjective and requires a sensitive ear — and a trained one.
With medical advances and competing devices over the past few decades, “the old stethoscope is kind of falling on hard times in terms of rigorous training,” said Dr James Thomas, a cardiologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. “Some recent studies have shown that graduates in internal medicine and emergency medicine may miss as many of half of murmurs using a stethoscope.”
Northwestern is involved in testing new technology created by Eko, a Berkeley, California-based maker of smart stethoscopes. To improve detection of heart murmurs, Eko is developing artificial intelligence algorithms for its devices, using recordings of thousands of heartbeats. The devices produce a screen message telling the doctor whether the heart sounds are normal or if murmurs are present.
Dennis Callinan, a retired Chicago city employee with heart disease, is among the study participants. At age 70, he has had plenty of stethoscope exams but said he feels no nostalgia for the devices.
“If they can get a better reading using the new technology, great,” Callinan said.
Chicago paediatrician Dr Dave Drelicharz has been in practice for just over a decade and knows the allure of newer devices. But until the price comes down, the old stalwart “is still your best tool,” Drelicharz said. Once you learn to use the stethoscope, he said, it “becomes second nature.”
“During my work hours in my office, if I don’t have it around my shoulders,” he said, “it’s as though I was feeling almost naked.”

334,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/first-all-female-spacewalking-team-makes-history/,"CAPE CANAVERAL: The world’s first all-female spacewalking team made history high above Earth on Friday, replacing a broken part of the International Space Station’s power grid.
As NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir successfully completed the job with wrenches, screwdrivers and power-grip tools, it marked the first time in a half-century of spacewalking that men weren’t part of the action. They insisted they were just doing their job after years of training, following in the footsteps of women who paved the way.

America’s first female spacewalker from 35 years ago, Kathy Sullivan, was delighted. She said it’s good to finally have enough women in the astronaut corps and trained for spacewalking for this to happen.
“We’ve got qualified women running the control, running space centres, commanding the station, commanding spaceships and doing spacewalks,” Sullivan told The Associated Press earlier this week. “And golly, gee whiz, every now and then there’s more than one woman in the same place.”
President Donald Trump put in a congratulatory call from the White House to mark “this historic event … truly historic.”
“What you do is incredible. You’re very brave people,” Trump told them as they wrapped up their spacewalk.
Replied Meir: “We don’t want to take too much credit because there have been many others — female spacewalkers — before us. This is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time … For us, this is really just us doing our job.”
NASA leaders, Girl Scouts and others also cheered Koch and Meir on. Parents also sent in messages of thanks and encouragement via social media. NASA included some in its TV coverage. “Go girls go,” two young sisters wrote on a sign in crayon. A group of middle schoolers held a long sign reading “The sky is not the limit!!”
At the same time, many expressed hope this will become routine in the future.
Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a three-time spacewalker who looked on from Mission Control in Houston, added: “Hopefully, this will now be considered normal.”
NASA originally wanted to conduct an all-female spacewalk last spring but did not have enough medium-size suits ready to go until summer. Koch and Meir were supposed to install more new batteries in a spacewalk next week but ventured out three days earlier to deal with an equipment failure that occurred over the weekend. It was the second such failure of a battery charger this year, puzzling engineers and putting a hold on future battery installations for the solar power system.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine watched the big event unfold from Washington headquarters.
“We have the right people doing the right job at the right time,” he said. “They are an inspiration to people all over the world including me. And we’re very excited to get this mission underway.”
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sent congratulations to Koch and Meir “for leaving their mark on history” and tweeted that they’re an inspiration to women and girls across America.
The spacewalkers’ main job was to replace the faulty 19-year-old old charge-regulating device — the size of a big, bulky box — for one of the three new batteries that were installed last week by Koch and Andrew Morgan. As the seven-hour spacewalk drew to a close, Mission Control declared success, informing the astronauts that the new charger seemed to be working and the space station was back to full power. The women dragged in the broken unit so it can be returned to Earth early next year for analysis.
“Jessica and Christina, we are so proud of you,” said Morgan, one of four astronauts inside. He called them his “astrosisters.”
Spacewalking is widely considered the most dangerous assignment in orbit. Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, who operated the station’s robot arm from inside during Friday’s spacewalk, almost drowned in 2013 when his helmet flooded with water from his suit’s cooling system.
“Everyone ought to be sending some positive vibes by way of airwaves to space for these two top-notch spacewalkers,” Dyson said early in the spacewalk.
Meir, a marine biologist making her spacewalking debut, became the 228th person in the world to conduct a spacewalk and the 15th woman. It was the fourth spacewalk for Koch, an electrical engineer who is seven months into an 11-month mission that will be the longest ever by a woman. Both are members of NASA’s Astronaut Class of 2013, the only one equally split between women and men.
Pairing up for a spacewalk was especially meaningful for Koch and Meir; they’re close friends. They’re also both former Girl Scouts.
It took two decades for women to catch up with men in the spacewalking arena.
The world’s first spacewalker on March 18, 1965, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, died last week. NASA astronaut Ed White became the first US spacewalker less than three months after Leonov’s feat. Women did not follow out the hatch until 1984. The first was Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya. Sullivan followed three months later.
Friday’s milestone spacewalk was the 421st for team Earth.

335,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/us-astronauts-embark-on-the-first-all-female-spacewalk/,"US astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir made history on Friday when they stepped outside the International Space Station (ISS) on the first all-female spacewalk.
The much-anticipated milestone for NASA was achieved during a relatively routine mission to swap faulty batteries on the station’s exterior.
Koch and Meir, clad in white spacesuits and tethered by cords to the station some 254 miles (408 km) above Earth, stepped into outer space at 7:38 am Eastern time (1138 GMT) to replace a faulty power unit designed to help condition energy stored from the station’s solar panels, NASA announced online as it showed live video of the action.
The mission, expected to last nearly five hours, follows a first attempt at an all-female spacewalk in March. It was called off because one of the astronaut’s medium-sized spacesuits was not configured and ready for the journey.
Astronauts on the space station, which became operational in 2000, have tallied 221 maintenance spacewalks, 43 of which included women astronauts, according to NASA.
Friday’s spacewalk, formally called extravehicular activities, is in line with the US space agency’s aim to ramp up inclusivity in space.
Koch is scheduled set to complete the longest single space flight by a woman by remaining in orbit aboard the station until February 2020. She said gender milestones such as the spacewalk are significant.
“There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories from people who look like them, and I think that it’s an important aspect of the story to tell,” she said at a NASA briefing in Houston this month.
Sandra Magnus, a former NASA astronaut who spent 136 days on the International Space Station, told Reuters she did not want events like Friday’s spacewalk to become gimmicks.
“We want them to happen because people have the skill sets and they’re available to do the job,” said Magnus.
“On the other hand, it’s important for young women to see women role models doing extraordinary things,” she said. “So there’s two sides of the coin. You want it to be normal but yet you want it to be special.”

BURNLEY: Manchester United climbed to fifth place in the Premier League after goals from Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford gave them a 2-0 win at Burnley on Saturday which leaves them a point outside the Champions League spots.
For all the question marks over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his side, United head into the New Year battling for a top-four place thanks in part to rivals’ inconsistency but also due to the emergence of Martial and Rashford as real attacking threats.
The win also ended a run of 14 matches without a clean sheet for United and was their first away since February, although Burnley’s shot-shy attack certainly made that task easier.
United’s midfield was weakened by the absence of midfielder Paul Pogba, still in recovery phase and rested after two recent substitute appearances, and Scott McTominay who Solskjaer says faces up to four weeks out with a knee injury.
The Norwegian coach was forced to hand a rare start to Nemanja Matic and, despite the absentees, United had little trouble gaining the upper hand against a cautious Burnley.

Rashford forced goalkeeper Nick Pope into action with a long-range free-kick and then hit the post at the end of a swift break while Martial had a shot cleared off the line by Phil Bardsley in the 33rd minute.
The French forward got the breakthrough a minute before halftime with a simple finish after Andreas Pereira robbed defender Charlie Taylor and slipped the ball across to Martial.
Sean Dyche’s Burnley side struggled to create any openings but were more positive after the break and David de Gea had to pull off a fine save in the 68th minute to keep out a low drive from Bardsley.
But after a spell of late pressure from the hosts, United wrapped up the win in stoppage time with Dan James breaking and finding Rashford, who rounded Pope and slotted home.
United end the year with back-to-back wins, following a 4-1 victory over Newcastle United on Boxing Day and the concerns raised by Solskjaer after the recent loss at Watford seem to have had the desired impact.
“We want to get (in the top four) and we’re not far away. We did (challenge) towards the end of last season as well, we were close to the top four, but then we dropped off,” he said.
“Now they’ve responded to the defeat against Watford, I put a challenge to them and they’ve put my words to shame so I’m very happy with them”.
Rashford is developing an impressive understanding with Martial and took time to praise the Frenchman, who scored twice in the win over Newcastle.
“He was brilliant again today. For a forward, there’s nothing better than scoring goals. Hopefully, it keeps his confidence high and this can continue until the end of the season,” he said.

With the win, TAC accumulated six points from three matches, while Sherpa have two points. NPC registered their first win in three matches and have four points, while Saraswoti faced their third straight loss.

In the day’s first match, TAC skipper Bharat Khawas and Tek Bahadur Budhathoki netted one goal each in the second half. Man-of-the-match Khawas opened the scoring in the 57th minute when he dodged defender Ashish Gurung before chipping over the advancing goalkeeper Kishor Giri.
TAC were 2-0 up four minutes later after Budhathoki capitalised on a defensive error to fire home from close. Budhathoki snatched the ball from Siewe after the defender failed to clear it. Moments later TAC skipper Khawas saw his shot cleared by defender Neeraj Basnet from the goalline.
The second half began with a delay of couple of minutes after Himalayan Sherpa Club sent in 12 players after the break. Along with the 11 players who went into the break, Bison Gurung also entered the field without being substituted. Midfielder Gurung later came in as a substitute in place of Binod Gurung in the 52nd minute.

Openers David Warner and Joe Burns led Australia to 28 for no loss at the break on a hot and muggy afternoon at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Warner was 16 not out, with Burns on four.
Defending a big first innings total of 467, Australia’s pacemen crushed New Zealand’s hopes of a series-levelling victory by routing the visitors’ remaining batsmen after lunch.
Fast bowler Pat Cummins finished with 5-28, with fellow quick James Pattinson claiming 3-34.
New Zealand, who trail the three-match series 1-0 after losing the opener in Perth, had resumed on 102 for six after lunch, with opener Tom Latham tasked with an improbable rescue mission.
Latham brought up his half-century but promptly gave up his wicket for 50, edging a Cummins delivery behind to wicketkeeper-captain Tim Paine.
All-rounder Mitchell Santner, who had survived an appeal for a catch before lunch after the ball appeared to graze his glove, was out for three nicking Pattinson.
The tail added 32 runs with some lusty swinging before Cummins and Mitchell Starc halted their charge.
Cummins notched his fifth victim by removing Tim Southee for 10 before Starc grabbed his second and wrapped up the innings by bowling Trent Boult for eight.
New Zealand had resumed in the morning at 44 for two, needing Latham and Ross Taylor to pull them to safety.
They instead lost three wickets by the morning drinks break in one dizzying hour of furious pace bowling.
Cummins struck twice in his second over, removing Taylor for four and Henry Nicholls for a golden duck in consecutive balls.
Pattinson missed out on Latham’s wicket when Steve Smith grassed a chance in the slips, but the paceman later banged in a short ball to have wicketkeeper BJ Watling caught for seven.
All-rounder Colin de Grandhomme stayed for a shaky 11 before he was caught nibbling at a short Starc delivery.

The 89th minute winner from Matt Doherty means Liverpool have a 13 point lead over second-placed Leicester City, who they beat 4-0 on Thursday, and Juergen Klopp’s side have played one game less than their two challengers.
“Nobody expected us to be this far away from Liverpool at this halfway point,” said City midfielder Bernardo Silva.
“We have to continue now. We know that winning the title is very complicated. I wouldn’t say impossible but very difficult.”

Wolves, who also beat City 2-0 in October, became just the second team to complete a league double over Pep Guardiola’s side, following Chelsea in 2016-17 and it was another comeback triumph for Nuno Espirito Santo’s team.
The Midlands side have now won 14 points from losing positions this season, more than any other team in the league.
City’s Brazilian keeper Ederson was sent off in the 12th minute after he raced out of his area and clipped Diogo Jota, who tumbled to the floor.
The VAR review backed referee Martin Atkinson’s decision but the system was soon back to familiar controversy when it awarded City a penalty — ruling that Leander Dendoncker had trod on the foot of City winger Riyad Mahrez.
Wolves keeper Rui Patricio saved Raheem Sterling’s spot kick, but VAR spotted an encroachment in the area by Conor Coady who had cleared the loose ball and so the penalty had to be retaken. Again, Patricio saved from Sterling but this time the England winger drove home the rebound to put City in front.
Sterling then doubled City’s lead, five minutes after the interval, with a composed finish after had been sent clear by a defence-splitting pass from Kevin De Bruyne.
Wolves got back into the game though, five minutes later, when Adama Traore, who had scored twice in Wolves’ win at City in October, beat substitute keeper Claudio Bravo with a low drive from outside the area.
It was poor defending from City full back Benjamin Mendy that handed Wolves the equaliser with less than ten minutes remaining. The Frenchman in trying to usher the ball out for a goal kick was robbed by Traore, who zipped a low pass across the goal to Raul Jimenez, who slotted home.
The dramatic winner came in the 89th minute when Matt Doherty weaved his way through the City defence before poking a left-foot shot past Bravo.
There was still time for Sterling to hit the bar with a stoppage time free-kick but it was not to be for the defending champions.
“Eighty minutes 10 against 11 is so tough, so demanding. We could not defend the result,” said Guardiola.
“We have to think of the next game and about winning our games. It’s unrealistic to think about (catching Liverpool). In 48 hours we have another game,” added the Spaniard.
Espirito Santo said his team had delivered a memorable evening for their supporters.
“It was a good night, a very good night. The game was fantastic. Everything changes with City with one men less but it was very good,” he said.

Ibrahimovic, 38, returns to Milan where he helped the club win their last league title in 2010-11 and scored 56 goals in 85 games in two seasons.
“AC Milan is delighted to announce the signing of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The club and the striker have agreed on a deal until the end of the current season with an option to extend the contract for the next one,” the club said in a statement.
Ibrahimovic last played for Major League Soccer side Los Angeles Galaxy, where he was the highest-paid player in the league and tallied 52 goals and 17 assists in two seasons before bidding adieu to the United States.
“I’m coming back to a club I hugely respect and to the city of Milan I love. I’ll fight together with my teammates to change the course of this season. I will do everything to make it happen,” said Ibrahimovic, who has scored over 500 goals for club and country.
The former Sweden international has had a storied career in Europe, playing for top clubs such as Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, Paris St Germain and Manchester United, winning numerous trophies in five different countries.
At Milan, he finished the 2011-12 campaign as Serie A top scorer before moving to PSG, where he topped Ligue 1’s goal charts twice in four trophy-laden seasons.
In November, he became part-owner of Stockholm club Hammarby – a decision that did not sit well with fans in his hometown Malmo, who reacted by vandalising a statue of the striker outside Malmo Stadium and branding him “Judas”.

MANCHESTER: Liverpool‘s resounding 4-0 win at second-placed Leicester City on Boxing Day sent them 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League but Juergen Klopp’s side have no time or inclination to bask in their success.
On Sunday, Liverpool are back in action against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield before another tricky home game against Sheffield United on Thursday.
Wolves are a team capable of upsetting anyone in the league but there was nothing in the impressive swatting aside of Leicester that suggests Liverpool are about to stumble.
They have the joint biggest lead in top-flight history at this stage of the campaign and no team has ever failed to win the title with an advantage of this size.
Already there is talk of Liverpool going through the league entire season unbeaten — matching the ‘The Invincibles’ of Arsenal in 2003/04 and Preston North End in 1888/89.
It may be predictable but Klopp is surely wise to avoid such discussions, especially as his club have never won the Premier League and are without a domestic league title for 30 years.
“I can write the stories myself: the first story is that never before in the history of football, British football at least, has a team had a bigger lead and lost the lead,” said Klopp.
“So that sounds in my ear negative, so why should we think about something like that? We are just focused on the next (games).
“We play Wolves, Sheffield United, Everton (in the FA Cup third round), Tottenham and Manchester United in the next five games. That doesn’t sound like anything is decided in my ears, to be honest,” he said.
CLOSEST BATTLES
Barring an unlikely Liverpool collapse, the closest battles this season are going to be for the top four places and at the bottom of the table.
Chelsea need to quickly sort out their form — they have lost five of their last seven league games — and on Sunday they make the short trip across London to face Arsenal in Mikel Arteta’s first home game in charge.
Chelsea have been better away from Stamford Bridge this season, with six wins in nine, but the Gunners, down in 11th place, sorely need to kick-start their season if they are to have any chance of European football next term.
Leicester have suffered successive defeats, to Manchester City and Liverpool, and will be anxious to keep their Champions League push on track with a win at struggling West Ham United.
Manchester City, who are at Wolves later on Friday, host surprise package, promoted Sheffield United who are in sixth place, on Sunday.
Manchester United, fresh from hammering Newcastle United 4-1 on Boxing Day, have a short trip to Burnley, while Spurs are away to bottom club Norwich City.

Head century puts Australia in charge on day two
NZ lose two early wickets in their reply to Australia‘s 467
Smith denied first century of home summer



MELBOURNE: Australia‘s pacemen struck twice to leave New Zealand vulnerable at 44 for two on day two of the Boxing Day test after Travis Head scored a sparkling century to put the hosts firmly in command.
Tom Latham was nine not out with Ross Taylor on two, and New Zealand facing a mountain to climb to reel in Australia‘s first innings total of 467.
The tourists’ opening woes continued, with Jeet Raval’s replacement Tom Blundell out for 15 edging a Pat Cummins delivery to wicketkeeper-captain Tim Paine.
The huge contingent of New Zealand fans in a crowd of 60,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground were soon groaning again when captain Kane Williamson top-edged a pull-shot to be caught by Paine for nine.
Under pressure to cement his place in Australia‘s middle order, South Australian scrapper Head completed his second test ton after tea and celebrated with emotion on a sun-drenched afternoon.
He was eventually dismissed for 114, smashing spin-bowling all-rounder Mitchell Santner straight to cover when looking for quick runs late in Australia‘s innings.
Head scored 56 in his first innings in the series-opener in Perth but was disappointed to give up his wicket with a loose drive off paceman Tim Southee.
“Last week I threw it away a little bit and then was really disappointed with that,” he said. “So it’s nice (to) get another opportunity.”
Head combined with captain Tim Paine in a 150-run partnership that all but crushed New Zealand’s hopes of forging a series-levelling victory after their 296-run loss in the pink ball test in Perth.
Their sixth-wicket stand was ended soon after tea when the tireless Neil Wagner trapped Paine lbw for 79, denying the Tasmanian skipper a maiden test hundred.
Kane Williamson’s bowlers mopped up the tail for the cost of only 34 runs but the damage was already done.
New Zealand managed only one wicket from the first two sessions on Friday, placing Williamson’s decision to send Australia in to bat upon winning the toss under an even harsher light.
After Australia resumed in the morning on 257 for four, paceman Wagner denied Steve Smith his first century of the home summer, dismissing the master batsman for 85 with a short ball for the third time in the series.
Smith was out parrying at a bouncer that pinged off the shoulder of his bat before being plucked out of the air with one hand by a leaping Henry Nicholls in the gully.
That was as good as it got for the Black Caps who were soon on the back foot as Head and Paine counter-attacked with vigour. The pair marched off unbeaten at tea, having survived the whole middle session and pushed Australia to 431 for five.

PRETORIA: South Africa’s new pacemen Anrich Nortje and Dwaine Pretorius took three quick wickets to reduce England to 157-6 at tea as the home side wrestled back the momentum on the second day of the first test at Centurion Park on Friday.
Nortje bowled Jonny Bairstow for one and had Ben Stokes caught behind soon after, following Pretorius’ initial breakthrough just when England were looking to gain the upper hand in a game of see-sawing fortunes.
Joe Denly, who made 50, and Stokes had put on 72 runs for the fourth wicket and seen England settle in after they lost captain Joe Root not long after lunch.
But South Africa fought back with three wickets in the space of 17 balls, leaving England still 127 runs behind the hosts’ first innings total of 284.
Jos Buttler (6) and Sam Curran (7) were not out at tea.
Root went in the third over of the second session, bringing Stokes to the crease, where he showed no ill effects from the dehydration that kept him off the field for part of the first day.
He hammered some lusty blows, including two successive sixes, allowing Denly, at the other end, to progress to a sixth test half century.
Denly, who was dropped in the slips before scoring and took 28 balls to get off the mark, made 50 off 108 balls before falling to the tiniest tickle as Pretorius grabbed a maiden test wicket but only after South Africa had asked for a review.
Then followed only a second test wicket for Nortje, playing in his third test, as he castled Bairstow and in his next over had Stokes caught behind for 35.
It was the fifth catch of the innings for wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, who had caught Joe Burns and Dom Sibley in the first session before England reached 60-2 at lunch.
South Africa resumed overnight at 277-9, adding seven runs to their tally but lasting just 11 balls.

“It was an easy victory at the end and I did not really enjoy the final round,” said Shrestha, who was at the eighth position after playing a round of oneover 73 on the first day. “I was confident of bouncing back as this is my favourite course and the second round score of seven-under 65 made all the difference,” he added.
Shrestha, who had a comfortable eight-stroke lead over fellow RNGC pro Rabi Khadka going into the final round, never faced any challenge in the final round. He began the day with three consecutive birdies and added another on the sixth. He took the turn at three-under 33 after dropping a shot on the eighth hole.

Australia resumed on 336 for five after lunch, with Head and Paine looking to continue their attack on the ageing ball.
They strode off with an unbeaten partnership of 147 runs, having comfortably seen off New Zealand’s pace bowlers and extracted more than four runs an over from spin-bowling all-rounder Mitchell Santner.
With Australia increasingly untroubled on a flattening MCG wicket, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson may be ruing his decision to send Paine’s team into bat after winning the toss.

Chelsea boss Frank Lampard said his attacking players had to do more to break down visiting teams after Thursday’s 2-0 loss to Southampton left them with two straight Premier League defeats at Stamford Bridge for the first time in eight years.
Goals from Michael Obafemi and Nathan Redmond gave improving Southampton a surprise win while Chelsea’s struggles against a tight defence left Lampard facing questions on whether he needs to add creative players in the January transfer window.
Chelsea have been cleared to sign players in January after the Court of Arbitration for Sport this month halved a transfer ban imposed on the club.
“I learn about the players, and I learn about the players particularly in games like that,” Lampard told reporters when asked if Thursday’s performance had nudged him in a certain direction on transfers.
Fourth-placed Chelsea — beaten by Bournemouth on their own patch earlier this month — last lost two successive games at home in November 2011 under Andre Villas-Boas.
They were beaten by West Ham United at Stamford Bridge last month and Lampard said that his front line had to respond.
“Players have to go one v one if you’re an offensive player, play round the corner, mix up your game and break defensive lines because teams aren’t stupid,” Lampard added.
“They’re well organised and you need to do more in an attacking sense.
“You cannot have 70% of possession and control, particularly the first half, and not do more, not hit better crosses, not hit better final passes, not get more clear chances at goal.”
Chelsea travel to 11th-placed Arsenal on Sunday.

Manang Marshyangdi Club defeated Brigade Boys Club 1-0 to register their third straight victory in the Qatar Airways Martyrs Memorial A Division League here at the ANFA Complex grounds today.
Jagajeet Shrestha scored the solitary goal of the match in the first half for the defending champions, who returned to the summit.
Shrestha found the back of the nets in the 25th minute after Vidal Luis Chissano’s attempt deflected to BBC defender.
With the win, MMC accumulated nine points and reclaimed the lead which they had lost to Machhindra Football Club on inferior goal difference. With their second loss in three matches, BBC have three points.
BBC made the first attack of the match in the third minute but skipper Anil Gurung ended up with a wide shot. MMC’s Bimal Rana failed to convert in one-on-one with BBC goalkeeper Bishal Sunar in the 23rd minute, while the striker saw his attempt saved by the custodian two minutes later.

Jaya Gurung came close to levelling the scores for BBC in the 52nd minute but MMC goalkeeper Deep Karki denied him, while Manang’s foreign recruit Femi Joshua Adewumi had an attempt saved by BBC custodian Sunar in the 55th minute. Bimal Rana was unlucky for the second time in the 66th minute when BBC glovesman Sunar made a brilliant diving save to stop his chip shot.
MMC were reduced to 10 men in the 73rd minute when Ekaraj Budhathoki received the marching orders for his dangerous tackle on BBC’s Bijay Gurung. But BBC were not able to capitalise on the numeric advantage.
At the Dasharath Stadium, Prabhu Jawalakhel Youth Club played a 1-1 stalemate with CMG Club Sankata. Skipper Laxman Ruchal put Sankata ahead in the 36th minute when he converted a free kick into a sensational goal from 35 yards out. Sankata earned the free kick after Fode Fofana brought down Ruchal. Dady Junior Bamba of JYC levelled the scores in the 72nd minute when he headed home from the area.
With their second draw in three matches, JYC accumulated five points, while Sankata have four points.

BOURNEMOUTH: A second-half equaliser from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave Mikel Arteta a point in his first game as Arsenal manager as his side came back from a goal down to draw 1-1 with Bournemouth in the Premier League on Thursday.
The two sides came into the game in poor form, with Bournemouth having lost six of their last seven and Arsenal only winning once since beating Bournemouth 1-0 at the Emirates on Oct. 6.
Arteta restored Mesut Ozil to the starting line-up and the German forward looked sharp in the opening exchanges, but despite Arteta energetically encouraging his team from the sidelines, they failed to create many chances.
Arsenal’s sloppiness was punished when they gave the ball away cheaply on the left wing and Bournemouth sliced through them quickly, midfielder Dan Gosling stabbing home Jack Stacey’s centre from close range to give the home side the lead.
The Gunners equalised in the 63rd minute as Reiss Nelson’s shot deflected into the path of Aubameyang, and he swivelled to rifle the ball home before a wild celebration with the traveling fans that earned him a yellow card.
Both sides created opportunities in the pouring rain, but neither could grab a winner and the draw left Arsenal in 11th place on 24 points, with Bournemouth four points further back in 16th.

“We missed a lot of chances in the second half, we should get the three points today but that can happen,” Aubameyang said. “I think the attitude of the boys was great but we have to improve our chances.”
Arteta was disappointed not to win the game, but said his players had performed well.
“In terms of attitude, desire and commitment it was better than I expect. They are not used to playing at this rhythm,” said the 37-year-old Spaniard, who spent five seasons as a player at the club.
“I am still learning about the players, about the priorities, to make them more secure when they jump on to the pitch. My only aim now is to find solutions, to attack better, defend better,” Arteta added.

LONDON: Goals from Michael Obafemi and Nathan Redmond earned improving Southampton a surprise 2-0 win at Chelsea in the Premier League on Thursday.
Obafemi broke the deadlock with his first goal of the season, bursting inside from the right and curling into the top corner after a tight opening half hour.
Frank Lampard changed his side’s formation from 3-4-3 to 4-2-3-1 at the break and nearly earned an instant dividend as substitute Mason Mount set up Tammy Abraham, who flashed a shot into the side netting.

Southampton winger Redmond was denied by Kepa Arrizabalaga on the break but coolly finished for the visitors’ second after an impressive team move to silence Stamford Bridge.
The hosts struggled to break down Southampton’s tight defence, and Ralph Hasenhuttl’s side rise to 14th, three points clear of the relegation zone, building on last weekend’s win over Aston Villa.
Chelsea stayed fourth with 32 points from 19 games and must pick themselves up for their visit to Arsenal on Sunday.
This performance added to recent home defeats by West Ham and Bournemouth, with Lampard’s team recording only two wins from their last seven league games, along with five losses.
Chelsea’s impressive victory at Tottenham on Sunday was quickly forgotten on a drab afternoon in wet west London.
“It’s the same story as a few of the last home games,” said Lampard. “We have to work, break defensive lines and do more in an attacking sense.
“If we want to stay (in the top four) we have to win more than we have done recently at home.”
Hasenhuttl ran onto the pitch to celebrate at full time and was hailed by Saints supporters long after the final whistle after going over to them.
“You can have a tactical plan but without passion it doesn’t work,” a delighted Hasenhuttl told reporters.
“We stayed brave, tried to keep them far away from our goal and it was by far the best performance this season.
“There’s still a long way to go, but in the first two or three months we played like a relegation team, now we’re playing like a Premier League team.”

MANCHESTER: Anthony Martial scored twice as Manchester United hit back in emphatic fashion from a rocky start against a benevolent Newcastle United to open their Christmas programme with a 4-1 victory at Old Trafford on Thursday.
After a 2-0 loss at Watford last weekend, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had demanded a response from his players but a yellow card for Scott McTominay after 24 seconds and going behind to Matty Longstaff’s 17th-minute goal was not what he had in mind.
It was all smiles later though as Newcastle folded and Martial, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford all struck before halftime before Martial scored again early in the second half as United moved back to seventh, four points off the top four.

United have now won 21 Premier League games on Boxing Day for a win percentage of 81% — more than any other club.
With midfielder Paul Pogba also coming on after halftime, only his second appearance since September because of injury, United will hope to end an up-and-down year with a flourish with a trip to Burnley looming on the horizon on Saturday.
“Against Watford we were not good enough for our standard but the boys showed a great intensity today and we thoroughly deserved the three points,” defender Harry Maguire said.
“We have now got a big game in two days and our story so far has been a good performance and then a not so good one.”
Newcastle have made steady progress up the table under former United defender Steve Bruce and could have gone above United with a win on Thursday. So when 19-year-old Longstaff tucked his shot past David de Gea after linking well with Joelinton the away fans went wild.
It was Longstaff who scored the winner in the reverse fixture at St James’ Park this season, but any sense of dread for the Old Trafford faithful soon diminished as United sparked into life to play some flowing football.
Six minutes after Longstaff’s goal, United were level with Martial’s shot squeezing in at the near post when Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka should really have kept it out.
Newcastle offered United another gift as they tried to play out from the back but merely gave the ball to 18-year-old Greenwood who thumped a left-footed cracker in off the crossbar.
It was Greenwood’s ninth goal of the season in all competitions and his emergence as a genuine goal threat has lifted the weight of expectation off the shoulders of Rashford who made it 15 for the season when he rose to head home Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s inviting cross before halftime.
Newcastle’s slipshod defending reached its nadir in the 51st minute when Sean Longstaff’s careless back pass was pounced upon by Martial who Dubravka with ease.
“We had a horrible 20 minutes before halftime,” Newcastle boss Steve Bruce said. “For the last two or three months we have been hard to beat. I know it’s Christmas but I don’t think Man Utd can believe it, we’ve made too many mistakes.”
Newcastle, who have now lost more Boxing Day games in the Premier League than any other side (14) remain in 10th spot.

LEICESTER: Rampant Liverpool moved 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League after Roberto Firmino struck twice in an emphatic 4-0 win at second-placed Leicester City.
The victory was inspired in large part by attacking right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold who created three goals and scored one himself.

With Firmino deadly in front of goal and Liverpool in total control throughout, it was a performance that suggested the title race is all but over at the half-way stage.
Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp has been vocal in his criticism of his team’s intense schedule but the European champions showed no signs of any adverse influence from their trip to Qatar, where they won the Club World Cup.
A trip to Leicester, who went into the game unbeaten at home this season, was the toughest test of the season, but Klopp’s men passed the test with barely a hint of drama and it will now take an extraordinary slump for them to fail to win their first title of the Premier League era.
“We played really good football after all the travelling and intense period, yes it is the best performance of the season and we controlled it, to get four goals is something to be proud of,” said Alexander-Arnold.
“You don’t really think you will be 13 points clear but we are happy to be in this position and we won’t take it for granted. This is the Premier League and anything can happen,” he added.
Popping up in the inside-left position, Alexander-Arnold floated a pinpoint cross to the backpost for Brazilian Firmino to head Liverpool into the lead in the 31st minute.
Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel then produced an outstanding close-range save to foil Sadio Mane and Liverpool would be have been disappointed to go in at halftime with only the solitary goal.
Liverpool were utterly dominant but had to wait until the 71st minute to extend their lead when Alexander-Arnold’s corner struck the left arm of Caglar Soyuncu and substitute James Milner slotted home the penalty with his first touch of the ball.
Firmino then made it 3-0, collecting and firing home a powerfully struck low-cross from Alexander-Arnold before the 21-year-old rounded off the rout, hammering a low shot into the far, bottom corner at the end of a swift counter-attack.
Liverpool have 52 points from 18 games; Leicester are on 39 points from 19 matches and Manchester City are 14 points behind the leaders before their game at Wolves on Sunday.
“It’s one of many successful nights so far this season,” said Milner.
“We are not even halfway. So much can change and happen. The strength of this team is we tale it one game at a time.

PRETORIA: England took a South African wicket with the opening delivery of their test series on Thursday, adding four more in the first two sessions before a strong sixth-wicket partnership saw the hosts through to 187-5 at tea.
James Anderson marked his 150th cap and return to the England attack at Centurion Park with the first-ball wicket of home opener Dean Elgar, as Sam Curran and Stuart Broad took two scalps each.
Quinton de Kock then sought to bash his team out of trouble, making a quickfire 64 off 69 balls to keep up home hopes of a decent score in the first innings of the four-test series.
He and 30-year-old debutant Dwaine Pretorius (25) had taken their unbeaten partnership to 76 by tea.
Broad, who had been a doubt after missing the warm-up games with flu, took 2-29 off 11 overs, including the promising Zubayr Hamza for 39 and captain Faf du Plessis, who made 29.
Curran had opener Aiden Markram out for 20 and then Rassie van der Dussen, another debutant at 30, caught behind for six.
The 37-year-old Anderson’s first ball back in test cricket for five months, having limped out of the Ashes with a calf injury, was a warm-up delivery down the leg side that Elgar tried to flick at but instead edged through to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.
That set the tone for a scratchy early batting display.
Markram looked in positive form after recovering from a broken wrist, sustained when he thumped the change room wall after being dismissed for a pair of ducks in South Africa’s second test in India in October.
But he contrived to chip the ball to Jonny Bairstow at midwicket for 20 off 23 balls.
Hamza, 24 and playing in just his third test, was caught behind by Ben Stokes off Broad for 39, just when he was looking likely to establish his credentials in an inexperienced South Africa team struggling after the recent retirement of many stalwarts.
England all-rounder Stokes elected to play as the health of his hospitalised father Ged, who fell seriously ill in Johannesburg on Monday, showed signs of improvement.
England’s selection had been in doubt up until Thursday morning as several players had been struck down by illness. Jack Leech, Ollie Pope and Chris Woakes remained out of contention, but Jofra Archer was another to recover in time to play.

Liverpool boss Juergen Klopp has described the Premier League’s hectic festive schedule as a “crime” against some teams that are forced to play two matches in the space of 48 hours.
The league leaders, who won the Club World Cup title by beating Brazil’s Flamengo last Saturday, take on second-placed Leicester City on Thursday and host Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday, but other teams including Manchester City are not as fortunate.
The champions visit Nuno Espirito Santo’s Wolves on Friday before welcoming Sheffield United on Sunday, prompting manager Pep Guardiola to write to the league to “thank” them for a demanding schedule.
“It is absolutely not OK,” Klopp told the British media. “There’s no reason why more teams do not get more than 48 hours between Premier League games.
“None of the managers have a problem playing on Boxing Day, but playing on the 26th and 28th is a crime. This year we play 26th and 29th and it’s like a holiday.”
The likes of Brighton & Hove Albion, Everton, Watford and Manchester United all play twice within 48 hours this week.
“I understand all those saying it shouldn’t happen. They’re not moaning. They’re telling,” Klopp added.
“We can say what we want but no one is listening… sports science gives you nothing to deal with this.
“The body needs a specific amount of time to go again. But we ignore that completely.”
Liverpool are looking to increase their 10-point advantage over Leicester, while the Foxes will aim to return to winning ways after their nine-match unbeaten run was ended by City.

PANCHTHAR: Timbung Lake, situated in between Panchthar and Taplejung districts, has grabbed the attention of travellers with it’s spectacular natural beauty, in recent times.
The lake is situated at 4,480 metres above the sea level.
A majority of domestic tourists as well as foreign tourists including from India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh come to visit the lake, especially from May to October.
Most of them come to enjoy sightseeing, view the scenic beauty of Himalayas and for religious purpose of late.
With the upgradation of trekking trails, other infrastructure and effective advertisement of the Lake, the number of tourists visiting the site has increased significantly in recent years, Khadak Bhandari, homestay entrepreneur, noted.
“We are trying our best to give optimum services to our guest. The lake is really like heaven,” Bhandari shared.
“The place is really amazing, beautiful and pristine. With better promotion, this place can be developed into a major touristic destination of eastern Nepal as it has lots of potentials,” Giriraj Gyawali, a traveller from Gulmi district, who made a maiden trip to Timbung Lake, shared.
“In comparison to earlier days, we receive at least 500 tourists during trekking season in recent days,” Bhim Bhandari, one of the homestay operator, said.
It takes a one-day bus ride and another one day trek to reach Timbung Lake, from Phidim, district headquarters, Dibli Oli, local guide, informed.

Buses from Tokyo’s Shinjuku district conveniently drop climbers off at a station located at the 2,300-metre (7,546 feet) point of the majestic mountain, the country’s tallest at 3,776 metres (12,388 feet). It’s not cheating. This is where most people start the long — and crowded — trek.





The Yoshida trail is the easiest and most popular among the routes to the top, with climbers wearing headlamps and carrying heavy packs spaced just feet apart on the rugged, rocky terrain. It takes an average hiker five to six hours to reach the summit. Most spend the night in simple mountain huts and start the final ascent in darkness. Crammed together in the sparse accommodations is part of the communal climbing experience.
Witnessing the sunrise from the summit of the nation’s symbolic mountain is hard to top. Watching it paint the sky deep orange is magnificent.
Climbing season runs from early July to early September, Mount Fuji will open to the public a couple of weeks before the Tokyo Summer Olympics opening ceremony on July 24.
After the descent, visit picturesque Lake Kawaguchi to photograph Mount Fuji from afar.

BANGKOK: Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, edged out Paris and London as the world’s most popular city to visit, according to a survey released on Wednesday, welcome news for Thailand after worries over a drop in foreign arrivals.
Bangkok was named the most-visited city for the fourth consecutive year, with about 22.8 million visitors reported in the annual rankings by MasterCard Inc.
Paris and London were ranked second and third, each with about 19.1 million arrivals, trailed by Dubai with 15.9 million.
Other Southeast Asian cities, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were fourth and fifth in the rankings, based on third-party research, proprietary analysis and public data across 200 destination cities.
New York, Istanbul, Tokyo and Antalya, Turkey, rounded out the top 10.
The number of international visitors across the 200 cities grew by 76% in the last 10 years.
Despite Bangkok’s longtime reign atop the list, the Thai tourism industry has faced headwinds, with arrivals dropping 1.03% year-on-year in May before recovering to grow 0.89% in June from a year earlier.
Tourism accounts for about 12% of Thailand’s economy.
However, weaker Chinese economic growth and a boat accident last year led to a drop off in Chinese arrivals in Thailand in the first half of this year.
The downturn in the number of visitors from China was partially offset by Indian arrivals.
Thailand expects to welcome 2 million Indian tourists in 2019, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, told Reuters, adding this was one year earlier than its target.
In August, the government extended a waiver of a 2,000 baht ($65) fee for visa-on-arrivals for tourists from 18 countries including those from China and India.
A growing middle class and increasing wealth in populations and the rise of low-cost airlines will make travel more accessible, Minor Hotels Chief Executive, Dilip Rajakrier, said in an email.
“Given only less than 10% of the China’s total population having passports today. The potential of the Chinese market will never fade,” he said.

371,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/thailand-extends-visa-fee-waivers-to-boost-tourism-as-growth-slows/,"BANGKOK: Thailand will extend until April next year a measure that waives fees for visas on arrival issued to tourists from 18 countries, as it looks to stimulate growth in tourism to spur a slowing economy, the prime minister said on Tuesday.
The waivers are part of a $10-billion stimulus package to boost growth, including a debt moratorium for farmers, loans for smaller businesses, and more money for low-income earners.
“The cabinet approved the extension of fee waivers until April 2020,” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters, adding that the scheme would cover Lunar New Year and the Thai new year, Songkran.
Foreign tourist receipts make up about 12% of Southeast Asia’s second largest economy, but arrivals increased just 0.89% in June, with visitors from China, the biggest source, declining 7.1% from a year earlier.
The fee of 2,000 baht ($65) is to be waived unil next year for travellers from 18 countries, including China and India.
But the cabinet rejected a proposal for visa-free entry for visitors from China and India, because of security concerns, government spokesman Narumon Pinyosinwat said.

Sunrise wasn’t spectacular on that recent summer day. But even ordinary dawn at Borobudur Temple — nine stone tiers stacked like a wedding cake and adorned with hundreds of Buddha statues and relief panels — provided a memorable experience.

The 9th-century temple is in the centre of Indonesia’s Java island, a densely populated region with stunning vistas. Other highlights include the towering Hindu temple complex of Prambanan, like Borobudur a UNESCO World Heritage site, and Mount Merapi, the country’s most active volcano, whose lava-covered slopes are accessible by jeep.
While the two temples draw many visitors, other foreigners head to the relaxing beaches of Bali, just east of Java and by far the most popular tourist destination in a nation of thousands of islands and almost 270 million people. More than 6 million tourists visited Bali last year, or about 40 per cent of 15.8 million visitors to Indonesia overall, according to official figures.
Recently reelected President Joko Widodo wants to change this dynamic by pushing ahead with “10 new Balis,” an ambitious plan to boost tourism and diversify Southeast Asia’s largest economy.
Key to the plan is to upgrade provincial airports and improve access to outlying destinations, such as Lake Toba on Sumatra island, more than 1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from Jakarta, the capital. Yogyakarta, the provincial city from where visitors head to Borobudur and Prambanan, is getting a second airport, expected to be fully operational later this year.
Widodo has been promoting his plan in meetings with foreign leaders and in recent interviews, including with The Associated Press, in hopes of encouraging foreign investment. The president of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation told the AP in late July that as part of his push, he would like to see more business ties with the Middle East.
“For investment and tourism, we would like to invite investors from the Middle East as much as possible because … we have many tourism locations in Indonesia, not only one or two or four, but many,” said Widodo. He did not give specifics.
Muslim tourists, including from the Middle East, might also be an easier fit for some of the more conservative areas earmarked for tourism development. Tourism officials have played down the possibility of cultural friction that might accompany the influx of more non-Muslim visitors, arguing that Indonesia’s brand of tolerant Islam can accommodate everyone.
“Maybe there are some particular locations that are very strict (religiously),” said Hiramsyah Thaib, who heads the “10 New Balis” initiative. “We believe we won’t have any problems. Sometimes we have problems in the media, but not in reality.”
Yet Islamic hard-liners have become more assertive in recent years, potentially spooking investors by undermining Indonesia’s image as a moderate nation. Thaib said he believes investor confidence rose “significantly” after Widodo defeated former special forces general Prabowo Subianto in April’s presidential election. Subianto had been backed by Muslim groups favouring Shariah law.
The tourism plan remains key to Widodo’s final five-year term, though at least one target — 20 million visitors this year — appears to have been too ambitious. The 2019 visitor tally is expected to be 18 million, based on current growth figures, said Thaib.
Still, the Indonesian tourism sector grew by 7.8 per cent in 2018, or twice the global average, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
One of the 10 sites earmarked for development is the Borobudur Temple area and nearby Yogyakarta, a city of several hundred thousand people that are embedded in a large metro area. The city is a centre of Javanese culture and a seat of royal dynasties going back centuries.
In 2017, former President Barack Obama and his family visited the city, where his late mother, Ann Dunham, spent years doing anthropological research. Obama, who lived in Indonesia as a child, toured Borobudur and Prambanan during the nostalgic trip.
But while the Obamas got around with relative ease, including private jet travel, ordinary visitors struggle with congested streets packed with motorbikes weaving in and out of slow-moving traffic.
Travellers hoping to be in place at Borobudur just before sunrise need at least 90 minutes to get there from Yogyakarta, a journey of 40 kilometres (24 miles). A 230-kilometre (140-mile) round trip to the Dieng highlands, with terraced fields, small temples and a colourful volcanic lake, requires a full day of travel, some of it on bumpy back roads.
Anton McLaughlin, a 55-year-old visitor from York, England, said he was astounded by the number of motorbikes in the streets. Speaking during a jeep tour of the slopes of Mount Merapi, he said he’s become more aware of the natural disasters Indonesians endure regularly. Indonesia straddles the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Merapi’s last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people, and the ruins of one destroyed hamlet were part of the tour.
“People just seem to crack on with life,” McLaughlin said.
Just a day after his tour, the volcano shot out hot clouds and lava that flowed 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) down its slopes. No casualties or damage were reported.
Jan Tenbrinke, 37, from Zwolle in the Netherlands, said Bali is the next stop for his family of four, but that he hoped to get a better sense of Indonesian culture in Yogyakarta.
In the city, tourists can visit workshops for Batik textiles, silver jewellery and Kopi Luwak — coffee made from partially digested coffee cherries that were eaten and defecated by wild tree cats, or civets. Billed as the “world’s most expensive coffee,” Kopi Luwak became known to a wider audience in the 2007 Jack Nicholson-Morgan Freeman movie “The Bucket List.”
Local museums, including two royal palaces and a former Dutch fort, pose a challenge for foreign visitors eager to learn more about local history and culture because they mostly lack easily accessible explanations in English.
Thaib, the tourism official, acknowledged that there is room for improvement. He said Indonesia is determined to catch up to other Asian nations, including Thailand, which he said began developing their tourism industries much sooner.
“There is still a lot of work,” he said of his nation’s efforts. “We believe we are on the right track.”

HIKKADUWA: Sipping fresh coconut water while sunbathing on deserted Hikkaduwa beach, Alexi Konchayenko, a sports trainer from Ukraine, struck a stoical note.
Bomb blasts can happen “anywhere, anytime,” he said, adding that he was not afraid. “Sri Lanka is an amazing country. This is my first visit and I will tell my friends also to come.”
His is a lone voice — and a lone presence. Sri Lanka was the Lonely Planet guide’s top travel destination for 2019, but since the Easter Sunday attacks on churches and luxury hotels, foreign tourists have fled.
Many of those booked to come in the next few months have cancelled. Hotel occupancy across the island has plummeted by 85% to 90%. The tropical beaches, restaurants and shops are empty.
The coordinated suicide bombings on April 21 not only destroyed lives but also wiped out the livelihoods of Sri Lankans who depend on tourism.
More than 250 people, including 45 foreigners mainly from China, India, the US and the UK, died in the Islamic State group-claimed blasts.
Tourists normally come to Hikkaduwa, in the southwest, for the strong waves that are perfect for surfing and sparkling clear waters made for snorkelling. Today, of the 27 hotels, very few are open. Most, along with the eateries that line the 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of palm-fringed beach, are closed.
Among the few hotels still open is Hikkaduwa Beach Hotel. On April 21, all 50 rooms were occupied; today, only a handful. “It’s a real disaster. We don’t know what to do right now,” said Sanjeewani Yogarajah, an executive with the hotel. She said the attack has cost the hotel 5.5 million Sri Lankan rupees ($31,000), forcing the hotel’s management to send half the staff home.
Some tourism officials say the damage to the industry after the bombings is worse than during the 26-year civil war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the government which ended a decade ago. At least then, the violence was mostly contained to the north of Sri Lanka, they said. This time, no part of the island has remained untouched by the blasts.
Lankesha Ponnamperuma, general manager of hotel chain Hikka Tranz, is one of the luckier ones. While most hotels report wholesale cancellations, he is surviving thanks to business from local residents. Last Friday, two-thirds of the 150 rooms were booked, mostly by domestic tourists.
“I haven’t sacked anyone yet. Instead, we are training our people to adjust their expenditure and helping them restructure their bank loans,” Ponnamperuma said.
The president of Sri Lanka’s Hotels Association, Sanath Ukwatta, said hotels have offered 30-50% discounts to entice local residents.
Such a strategy won’t solve the problem, he said, but will “help at least to keep the hotels going.”
The manager of a clothing shop said the owner had shut the group’s other two shops and the factory too. “Business collapsed after April 21,” said Kumari, who declined to give her surname.
According to government figures, there has been an 80% drop in arrivals since the attack. Tourism accounts for 4.9% of Sri Lanka’s GDP. Last year, 2.3 million tourists visited the island, generating $4.4 billion in revenues, a nearly 12% jump from 2017. Around half a million Sri Lankans directly depend on tourism while 2 million depend on it indirectly.
One of them is Mohomed Musflick, the owner of a souvenir shop in Galle which is full of wood carvings, local paintings and postcards. “I have not sold one item. There are no tourists and we are in a huge crisis,” he said.
While life is gradually returning to normal on the island with offices and schools re-opening, the tourism industry is in a sombre mood over the slump in foreign tourists. Tour operators from Russia, Norway and Britain have cancelled bookings going right up to April 2020.
A travel ban issued by nearly a dozen countries is the greatest cause for concern. “The ban is our main worry. Until it is removed or softened, we can’t start our marketing to attract tourists. If it is lifted soon, we are hopeful we can bounce back this year or otherwise definitely next year for sure,” said Yogarajah.
In the meantime, Sri Lanka’s government should target “people and countries resilient to this kind of attacks and situations, such as Russia, Israel and India,” said Anusha Frydman, managing director of the Lavanga Resort and Spa.
The industry is clear about what else it wants from the authorities: Ensure that stringent security measures are in place to reassure potential visitors; persuade politicians to put their differences aside and adopt a bipartisan approach on national security; and work fast to get the travel ban lifted.
To help the industry cope, the government has put together a relief package comprising easy loans at special rates and reduced taxes. The government also plans to formulate a $100 million insurance fund for compensation to any tourist injured or killed while visiting the island.
“In the past we have had many serious crises and we have recovered. I am quite positive we can do it again,” said Jan van Twest, general manager of the Fortress Resort and Spa near Galle, where 750 room nights have been cancelled from May to October.
“But we need to recover, recover very fast,” he said.

Whenever I told someone I was planning to climb to Mount Everest Base Camp this spring, I received the same shocked and wide-eyed response: “Be careful!” While that’s good advice for any adventure, it was difficult to convince friends and family that this trip would not at all be the same thing as actually climbing Mount Everest.
Instead, the Everest Base Camp Trek provides an opportunity for regular hikers like me to tackle a feasible portion of one of the most iconic climbs in the world.
Base Camp is located at 17,600 feet, well below the peak of Everest, which is 29,000 feet. Base Camp is where those planning to summit spend weeks acclimatising and preparing for their journey. It is also the furthest you can go using only your legs before other equipment like ropes and ice picks get involved.
Our eight-day journey to Base Camp began at 9,300 feet, in the small Nepalese mountain town of Lukla. There are no roads to Lukla. It is accessible only by a 30-minute plane ride from Kathmandu. When we landed, I was shocked to find the area crowded and bustling, filled with locals selling trinkets and outdoor gear, and what felt like hundreds of trekkers preparing for their climbs.
From Lukla, we wound our way up muddy paths and across dangling suspension bridges, stepping aside for herds of yak and dzo (yak/cattle hybrids) as we walked further and further into the most remote area in which I have ever hiked.
Yet, it didn’t feel that way. Small towns continued to greet us all the way up. There were lodges to stay in. There were restaurants and bars. I have photos at the world’s highest Irish pub and the world’s highest bakery. In one of the larger towns, Namche Bazaar, at about 11,200 feet, there was even a North Face store. In these towns, dozens of miles from the nearest road, all food and supplies are brought in by helicopter, porter or animal.
In addition to breathtaking, 360-degree views of the Himalayas, elaborate Buddhist monuments lie along the entire route. Every day along the trail we saw massive, intricately painted boulders and colourful stupas (structures meant to bring good karma) wrapped in multicoloured prayer flags. At one point, we even toured a large, fully functioning monastery.
The terrain itself is not as difficult as you’d expect. Anyone in good physical shape could do it, and I have done many other hikes that I found more challenging. We still climbed several thousand feet per day, but the inclines were relatively gradual. This trek, instead, should be known for its panoramic views and the unique experience of hiking through these remote mountain towns.
Of course, the trip is not without risks, but they lie in unexpected places. The flights to and from Lukla are the most dangerous part of the journey. The Lukla airport has long been considered one of the most dangerous airports in the world — and in fact, a fatal crash occurred while we were there. I tried to push the knowledge of the airport’s dangers to the furthest recesses of my mind as I boarded a tiny propeller plane bound for that very place.
The plane ride is beautiful, with mountains on all sides, but the landing is enough to put even the fiercest adventurer on edge. A standard runway is between 6,000-8,000 feet long; Lukla’s is only 1,700 feet long. It’s sloped upward to help slow the plane before it hits the solid rock wall waiting at the end of it. At the other end is a 2,000-foot drop. After landing safely, we were mesmerised watching the planes taking off for Kathmandu literally fly off the edge of a cliff.
Altitude sickness is also a concern, though if you work with an experienced guiding company as we did, they will ensure you climb up slowly to acclimatise. We had two layover days and hiked a far shorter distance each day than our bodies were capable of going. This itinerary helped us grow accustomed to the air as it grew thinner.
Hiking up slowly didn’t feel like a burden, though, as it allowed extra time to take in those jaw-dropping views. The higher I climbed, the more I felt like I could reach out and touch the shimmering, snow-capped peaks. The further we progressed, the more the mountains seemed to bend toward us like we were inside of a snow globe.
At several points, we caught sight of Everest’s majestic peak peering out from behind its neighbours. Most of Everest lies in Tibet, but the peak is in Nepal. As such, the trek to Base Camp does not actually take place on Mount Everest, but inside Sagarmatha National Park — Sagarmatha being the Nepalese name for Everest.
Each day, as we made it a little higher, the air became a little thinner and our breath a little shorter. By day eight, the time between each step I took had grown significantly. I was breathing hard. My feet were dragging and my head pounding. I trudged slowly upward, but upward nonetheless, knowing the goal was within reach.
By mid-afternoon, we hiked across the final ridge and Base Camp came into view. We had made it to the gateway to the top of the world.
Base Camp rests on a massive glacier. I high-fived my group and took in the sight of dozens of yellow tents pitched across the ice, tents belonging to those preparing for their ascent. According to my trekking guide, the glacial terrain changes so rapidly that the expeditioners have to move their tents every two weeks.
We took pictures beside the sign declaring we were there and feasted on dark chocolate almond bark to celebrate. As the afternoon clouds rolled in, we lay back and watched the mountains disappear above our heads. The cheers and squeals of more trekkers arriving filled the air as it began to snow.
It may not have been the top, but it was nonetheless a spot where most people on the planet will never set foot. I feel so lucky to have stood in that very special place, and, as I always do at the end of a hike, I feel so strong knowing it was my own two feet that got me there.

Photo: AP
AMSTERDAM: The city of Amsterdam’s latest attempt to rein in the nuisance of over-tourism by banning guided tours of the red light district has run into opposition from some of the people it is intended to protect: sex workers.
The Dutch capital plans to ban such tours, saying they are disrespectful and contribute to congestion in the narrow, canal-side streets where scantily-clad sex workers sit behind windows to attract customers.
The first step in the new policy was taken Monday night in the red light district, with tours banned from 7 p.m.
On a recent Friday night, the problem was clear to see: Tourists bathed in a red glow emanating from the windows and peep shows’ neon lights were packed shoulder to shoulder as they shuffled through the alleys.
But sex workers’ union Proud questions whether banning tours will reduce tourist numbers and argues that guides educate visitors and encourage them to behave more respectfully toward the women.
“It could also be that now there are no guides that people just wander into the area themselves and gawk at the women behind the window and take photos because there is no one anymore to inform them how to behave or what the rules of the game are in this area,” said a sex worker who goes by the name of Velvet and is the advocacy coordinator for Proud. Velvet declined to give her real name, saying that because of the stigma attached to sex work, most sex workers use a working name or pseudonym to protect their privacy and safety.
Amsterdam’s Prostitution Information Center, which is housed in the same building as Proud, offers its own red light district tours.
The total ban on guided tours, which is planned to come into full force on Jan. 1, is another step in the city’s campaign to reduce the problems associated with over-tourism and part of a broader package of measures reining in tours in the city.
Bobien van Aalst of the Dutch tour guide association Guidor slammed the ban on tours, not just to the red light district but to other historic parts of the city. She said it means guides won’t be able to explain to tourists where Rembrandt van Rijn painted one of his first famous works or where the painter’s wife is buried.
“I mean it’s like in Paris if you’re forbidding (tours) to go to the Arc de Triomphe or the Eiffel Tower,” she said.
City Hall says that more than 1,000 tour groups per week now operate around the Old Church Square in the heart of the red light district.
“Yeah, there’s really over-tourism there — too crowded. I mean there were evenings where … residents basically couldn’t leave their homes anymore because the alleys were blocked,” the city’s deputy mayor, Udo Kock, told The Associated Press.
People who work in Amsterdam’s sex industry question whether there are more tourists, or whether similar numbers are squeezing into a red light district that has shrunk in recent years as hundreds of the sex workers’ windows have been shuttered in an attempt to diversify the narrow streets.
Kock acknowledges that not everybody is happy, but says many others are pleased that the city is tackling the tours.
The red light district is a tourist magnet, especially after dark, with crowds of people waiting to get into sex shows and visiting the Red Light Secrets Museum of Prostitution, where you can experience the windows from a sex worker’s perspective by sitting on a stool in front of a “window” onto which images are projected of men walking past and peering in.
The museum’s manager, Natascha Flipsen, agrees that guided tours help educate the visitors not just about the history of the centuries-old red light district, but also about how to treat the women who work there with respect.
And she says that tourism is good for the business.
For tourists, “this is like the once in a lifetime experience, so they visit the sex work as well of course,” Flipsen said.

So, my brother, who lives in the US, was getting married. Arrange a visa, head to the States to attend the wedding — that’s a lot of work. I thought I’d just wish him from here. A few days later, a Viber group was created including me and other children from my maternal family, and all of my mother’s sisters — eight in total. Now the wedding would take place in Bali, Indonesia. Wow a ‘Destination Wedding’!
More excited than ever, I agreed that I was going. So I started saving, and yes the time finally came.
I took leave from office for 10 days, booked the tickets for my mother and me, and started packing. When I left my house and reached the airport, it didn’t feel like I was actually going to Bali, but when I sat on the plane, I realised that my journey had begun. The flight, which was pretty chilled with a couple of beers, was of around four hours to Singapore, our transit point.
Then through tough Singapore security, helped by Starbucks coffee and a coconut drink, we were finally on our way to Bali.
So Bali. What can I say? The first thing that crossed my mind is ‘hot and sweaty’. As we got the hang of the weather, we found our guide, and an hour’s drive to the villa.





The sight along the way was awesome — statues of Hindu deities were around every street and corner. And you could see beautiful hand-carved statues of Ganesha and other deities in the shops, a breathtaking scene, their faith in religion, how they worship the gods.
I later found out that they are so religious that all of Bali was closed for two days for New Year’s prayers a day before we arrived. They meditate and pray at temples and their homes.
The villa was like a dream house with a swimming pool. The first thing I did was leave my baggage and go to a local pub for some chilled beers. The most popular and loved beer was Bintang, which cost 25,000 rupiah a bottle — shocking at first, but I later realised it’s around Rs 200.
People from all over the world, especially Australians come here to surf.
The weather is humid, so you sweat like crazy. It is constant summer with no winter, and even the metrology can’t predict rainfall. So it’s mandatory to spend your day in the pool with yes, chilled beer.
The local food was amazing, and hospitality commendable. The beautiful sunset by the ocean added to our first few days making everything surreal.
We also went for Luwak coffee tasting where they give you different drinks of flavoured tea and coffee, which was all free until you wished to drink the world’s most expensive coffee — Luwak animal poop coffee. The process to extract the poop was amazing using traditional hand method of collection to packing. A small cup cost us around 350,000 million Indonesian rupiah, and to buy a small pack I spent nearly 750,000 million rupiah, a gift for my dad that equals around $80. Crazy right? And it was really strong too.
The monkey temple was cool, more like a jungle with amazing sculptures of deities and filled with monkeys, better looking than the ones from Nepal. More mature looking I must say.
Then we visited the Saroswati Temple famous for its lotus blooms. Most people come for wedding photo shoots.
I also pampered myself to a fish spa for my feet. So ticklish!
Then the big day arrived — everything had to be Nepali style, the groom in a car to the wedding temple to the attire to the wedding dance janti. People were amazed, a few even made attempts to film the wedding.
About 50 guests attended the wedding.
The temple where the wedding was held was a massive one dedicated to Lord Shiva. The rituals were in Sanskrit language and I couldn’t understand any of it! The ritual was short as compared to Nepal, the ceremony concluded in just around two hours.
My brother had hired an amazing wedding planner. The ceremony was for two days — mehendi night at our new villa by the beach with black sand, a Jacuzzi and a swimming pool and breathtaking view of the surfers. The whole night was a blast with no sleep where my phone dived into the pool and died. Sad story but …
The next day was the wedding — early morning ceremony by the ocean and janti in 1940s classic vehicle headed towards the temple where the ceremony took place. The reception took place in the evening where a Balinese fire dancer showcased all kinds of acts and fire tricks. The decoration was beautiful with all the lights reflected by the pool of our villa.
We had heard of the popular Bali swing, so the last day we spent seeing that and other sites and shopping places.
Though we had a few mishaps  — a few had their luggage arriving a day late, one bashed his head swimming at 3:00 am, one broke his leg, my aunt lost $1,200, and I dropped my phone in the pool, it was one heck of a week.
As I write this story, I still feel the wind, the ocean, my family’s laughter and the closeness we felt coming together from different parts of the world for a week, leaving our hectic lives behind to enjoy and be together in a beautiful new place and for such an auspicious occasion. It was an experience of a life time.

CYRENE, LIBYA: Graffiti covers the walls of a Greek amphitheatre in Cyrene, an ancient ruined city in eastern Libya now struggling with neglect, vandals and illegal confiscation of land by locals.
The deserted souvenir shops and cafes on the mountainous road leading to the 2,600-year-old site are the only reminders that this used to be a major tourist destination.
Looting has hit Libya’s archaeological sites since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 when the country descended into turmoil with rival administrations competing for control.
Cyrene is one of five of UNESCO’s World Heritage sites in the North African country listed for their outstanding value. Others include the ruins of the Roman city of Leptis Magna, and Sabratha, both in western Libya.
Apart from Cyrene, some 200 km (124 miles) east of Benghazi, the east of the country has the Apollonia site just 20 km away.
With tourists gone and the antiquities department complaining about budget shortages, vandals have smeared graffiti on columns and looted artefacts.
Some treasures such as heads or entire torsos of statues listed in guidebooks issued in 2011 are no longer there.
“Many artefacts have been smuggled abroad,” said Ahmad Hussein, the head of the antiquities department of a parallel administration in charge of eastern Libya.
Unable to prevent theft, his department has been registering artefacts, a process which has helped to recover some in Europe, he said.
There was better site protection before 2011, but excavation at the site, in fact, dates back to Italian rule — the colonialists’ equipment can still be seen. The last Italians left the east in 1943 following their military defeat when the region came under British administration.
“There has been a lot of destruction in recent years,” said Ismail Miftah, a farmer living next to Cyrene. “Ordinary people don’t appreciate the ancient heritage.”

KATHMANDU: Four Sherpa climbers who got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Mt Makaulu Base Camp in two-metre deep snow in Sankhuwasabha for over a week shared that the high route of the Great Himalaya Trail witnessed an unusual snowfall in this winter season.
Four climbers – Pemba Jangbu Sherps, Darinji Sherpa, Pemba Rinji Sherpa and Pasang Gelu Sherpa were rescued by a Kailash Air helicopter on Monday as they ran out of food in the mountain area while embarking on a trek namely “German Nepal Friendship: The Great Himalaya Trail in Winter”.
It was really an unusual snowfall in the region, one of the team leaders Pemba Jangbu shared.
“We had to to turn around due to heavy snow in the Barun-Valley in Sankhuwasabha this season,” he said, recounting that as this is was a friendship project between Nepal and Germany the crew continued to Barun Dobhan trying to reach the high passes – Sherpani Col 6,110m, West Col 6,100m and Amphu Labtsa 5,700m – to cross into Khumbu.
“This is not only the story of the first ever attempt of the GHT High Route in winter but a story about German-Nepali friendship,” German Geographer Hannes Kuenkel, who is also a leader of the team, added.
This year the crew regrouped and was joined by seven experienced Sherpa – Darinji, Pemba Rinji, Pasang Gelu, Dafuri, Pasang Dawa, Phurba Sonam, Pasang Tendi – from Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Municipality-1, Solokhumbu, German photographer Martin Poetter and Austrian videographer Julia Brunner.
As they started their trek from Olongchun Gola where they had to break up last time and then crossed the snowy Lumbha Samba Pass (5,175m), the team reached Arun Valley on January 11.
“As all routes up to Makulu Base Camp were very difficult we tried the High Route above Hongon up to Malun Pokhari at 4,000m and we had experienced heavy snowfall and up to two feet high snow which made it impossible to hike with heavy loads,”  Kuenkel said.
As the weather was very unpredictable and the route not marked or built the team decided to take their only chance for the High Route by splitting the group in Gadhi on January 19 and sending the four strongest Sherpas led by Pemba Jangbu with only minimum equipment and light packs via Keke La pass (4,100m) towards the high passes while the others returned to Tumlingtar and flew via Kathmandu to Namche to meet up with the crew again, according to him.
The plan was that the Germans met the Sherpa again in Khumbu and together finished the Eastern part of the GHT via the icy Trashi Labtsa Pass (5,777m).
“Unfortunately the weather became worse and the Sherpa team got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Makaulu Base Camp in up to two-metre deep snow and the crew experienced 120 hours of continuous snowfall between January 22 (1pm) and January 28 (1am).”
On January 24, the snowfall stopped for 13 hours but the helicopter could not start from Kathmandu due to bad weather there. Pemba Jangbu who led over 26 expeditions told that he never experienced this kind of snowfall before. “On 28th January, a helicopter rescue was successful. It was just in time as the crew run out of gas and food.”
This winter the extraordinarily heavy snowfall did not allow the team to continue. So the team returned to Kathmandu were they stay together as friends and already prepare plans for a next attempt, according to Kuenkel, who visited Nepal for 15 times.
The two expedition leaders Pemba Jangbu and Kuenkel mentioned that they continued this project for three reasons: to promote trekking in Nepal, make people sensitive for the consequences of global warming and demonstrating how strong and powerful the international friendship can be.
According to team members, Pemba Jangbu, also owner of IAM Trekking & Expeditions and the German Geographer Hannes met during an Everest North Side Expedition which was shattered by the big earthquake in 2015.
In January 2017 they started the first attempt of the GHT High Route in winter. As the eastern part of Nepal has the highest mountains and passes they decided to take that challenge first and go from East to West starting in Taplejung.
They went up to Pangpema BC of Kantschendzonga, crossing the Nango La (4700m) to Olangchung Gola. That year the German became heavily sick in Olangchung Gola and had to give up early.

BANGKOK: Thailand approved marijuana for medical use and research on Tuesday, the first legalisation of the drug in a region with some of the world’s strictest drug laws.
The junta-appointed parliament in Thailand, a country which until the 1930s had a tradition of using marijuana to relieve pain and fatigue, voted to amend the Narcotic Act of 1979 in an extra parliamentary session handling a rush of bills before the New Year’s holidays.
“This is a New Year’s gift from the National Legislative Assembly to the government and the Thai people,” said Somchai Sawangkarn, chairman of the drafting committee, in a televised parliamentary session.
While countries from Colombia to Canada have legalised marijuana for medical or even recreational use, the drug remains illegal and taboo across much of Southeast Asia, which has some of the world’s harshest punishments for drug law violations.
Marijuana traffickers can be subject to the death penalty in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.
But in Thailand, the main controversy with legalisation involved patent requests by foreign firms that could allow them to dominate the market, making it harder for Thai patients to access medicines and for Thai researchers to access marijuana extracts.
“We’re going to demand that the government revoke all these requests before the law takes effect,” said Panthep Puapongpan, Dean of the Rangsit Institute of Integrative Medicine and Anti-Aging.
Some Thai advocates hope that Tuesday’s approval will pave the way for legalisation for recreational use.
“This is the first baby step forward,” said Chokwan Chopaka, an activist with Highland Network, a cannabis legalisation advocacy group in Thailand.

BERLIN: More than 6 million visitors, 7.5 million liters of beer, 124 rotisserie oxen and Bill Clinton in lederhosen; another Oktoberfest in Munich has come and gone.
Festival organizers say good fall weather helped attract 100,000 more people to the annual event than last year; in all, 6.3 million from about 70 countries. That’s despite this year’s Oktoberfest running only 16 days — two fewer than in 2017.
Former US President Clinton and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showed up Friday night — he dressed in traditional Bavarian garb and she in a trademark pantsuit.
Security guards confiscated 101,000 liter-size beer mugs from sticky-fingered guests seeking souvenirs. Munich authorities cleaned up 95 tons of garbage during the festival that ended Sunday.

MEDORA: For travelers looking to visit all 50 states, North Dakota is often one of the last to be checked off. It’s not exactly on the way to anywhere else, and flying there is expensive.
It ended up being 49th on my 50-state quest (sorry, Idaho!). Part of the challenge was deciding what to do there and how to get there. I had to choose between visiting Fargo in eastern North Dakota (and the name of one of my favorite movies) or Theodore Roosevelt National Park in the west.
It’s 330 miles (530 kilometers) between them, and I didn’t have time for both on a week-long road trip that also included Montana’s Glacier National Park and Idaho’s Craters of the Moon.
In the end, Roosevelt Park won out. Photos of its badlands and prairies enchanted me, and the story of Teddy Roosevelt’s sojourn there following the deaths of his wife and mother on the same day intrigued me.
What was it about this place that allowed this future president to grieve and recover — while at the same time inspiring him to become one of America’s most influential conservationists? I needed to see it for myself.
GETTING THERE
My husband and I flew to Denver — by air from New York, the cheapest jumping-off point — and rented a car (unlimited mileage, of course). We then drove 600 miles (965 kilometers) north through Wyoming and South Dakota to the tiny North Dakota town of Medora (population 132), at the entrance to the park’s South Unit.
Fortunately, those 600 miles were easily done in a day, thanks to speed limits of 75 and 80 mph (120-128 kph) in many spots, and little traffic outside Colorado. Still, it felt like we were heading to a pretty remote place, and I wondered if the park would hold its own against national parks I’d visited in Alaska, Hawaii and the Southwest, not to mention Yellowstone and Yosemite.
About 700,000 people visit Roosevelt Park yearly, compared to the more than 3 million annual visitors at places like Montana’s Glacier Park.
THE LOOP AND WILDLIFE
Teddy Roosevelt Park is open 24 hours daily. We arrived at 7:30 a.m. one day at the tail end of last summer. Map in hand, we drove the 36-mile (58-kilometer) scenic loop around the park’s South Unit, stopping at many of the nearly 20 points of interest along the way.
Within minutes, we came upon a prairie dog town. Dozens of the tiny creatures scampered back and forth, popping in and out of little holes amid scrubby grasses. We’d see three more prairie dog towns before we completed the loop, along with wild horses grazing on a hill by the roadside and in another spot, a herd of bison.
The wildlife encounters were thrilling and unexpected surprises.
THE LANDSCAPE
The landscape was thrilling too. The scent of sage perfumed the air, and bursts of red foliage punctuated the gray-green grasslands. Stripes of peach, cream and mud-brown earth and stone lined the curving banks of the Little Missouri River.
Framing it all were the famous badlands stretching to the horizon: flat-topped stone formations with striated slopes in tawny yellows and russet reds, dotted with bright green trees and patches of grass. They looked like the crusty paws of some massive alien creature on the verge of rising up.
We did most of the hikes along the loop drive, some just a few minutes’ walk to an overlook, others 20 to 40 minutes along hilly trails covering a mile or more. At every stop, we were awed by the scenery, from the astonishing palette of earthy hues to the stone shapes etching land and sky.
ROOSEVELT’S STORY
An exhibit at the visitor center tells Roosevelt’s story. On his first visit in 1883, he hunted bison and invested in a ranch near Medora. He’d been a state assemblyman in his native New York, but after his mother and wife both died on Feb. 14, 1884, he left politics and returned to the badlands to mourn his losses.
He lived in a small ponderosa pine cabin now located just steps from the visitor center. It’s furnished with period pieces and some of his belongings, including his traveling trunk, a replica of his writing desk and a rocking chair.
Roosevelt lived the cowboy life, spending days riding and herding in what was considered America’s last frontier. His experiences there were formative: He lost more than $24,000 when blizzards decimated the cattle he’d invested in. He witnessed the environmental damage done by overgrazing. And he realized that the bison, who once roamed the plains in the millions, had dwindled to the hundreds.
Roosevelt wrote three books inspired by his Western sojourn. He eventually returned to politics, serving as New York governor and from 1901-1909, as US president. His accomplishments included the conservation of 230 million acres of land, a legacy that led to the creation of the National Park Service in 1916.
For me, Roosevelt Park ranks among the most interesting and beautiful I’ve seen. I wish I hadn’t waited so long to visit, and I hope someday to go back and absorb more of the place that Roosevelt called “a land of vast silent spaces — a place of grim beauty.”

DENPASAR, INDONESIA: The Indonesian tourist island of Bali closed its international airport Friday, stranding thousands of travelers, as the Mount Agung volcano gushed a 2,500-meter (8,200-feet) column of ash and smoke.
The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said nearly 450 flights were canceled, affecting some 75,000 people.
The regional Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Darwin, Australia, said winds would carry the ash southwest toward Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island. Volcanic ash is a potentially deadly threat to aircraft that can cause engines to “flame out.”
The volcano began belching ash and smoke on Thursday and several airlines canceled inbound and outbound flights scheduled for the evening.
“We hadn’t a place to stay for the night so we had to find something else, just took a taxi and stayed at a random hostel,” said a stranded German backpacker who identified herself as Louisa. “We hoped that we could leave this morning, but the airport is closed,” she said.
Two small airports, at Banyuwangi and Jember in eastern Java, also closed because of the ash threat.
Agung’s alert level has not been raised and an exclusion zone around the crater remains at 4 kilometers (2.5 miles).
The disaster agency said the closure of Bali’s airport is in effect until 7 p.m. It said the situation will be reviewed at midday.
Australia’s national airline Qantas said in a statement that it’s “currently not safe” to operate Bali flights.
It said it was monitoring advice from the ash advisory center and its own pilots and meteorologists would decide when flights can resume.
The volcano, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) northeast of Bali’s tourist hotspot of Kuta, last had a major eruption in 1963, killing about 1,100 people.
It had a dramatic increase in activity last year, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, but had quietened by early this year. Authorities lowered its alert status from the highest level in February.
Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Government seismologists monitor more than 120 active volcanoes.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: Once a pristine Thai paradise, the secluded bay made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie “The Beach” has been exhausted by mass tourism. Now it’s getting a break.
After Friday, the daily influx of dozens of boats and thousands of visitors unsuccessfully scrambling for an unspoiled view of Maya Bay’s emerald waters and glistening white sand will end. The attraction is being closed for four months to give its coral reefs and sea life a chance to recover.
Thailand has promoted unfettered tourism for decades and the onslaught on Maya Bay, which is on Phi Phi Leh Island in the Andaman Sea, has only picked up pace in recent years. Authorities now say they are striving to balance profit and conservation and the closure will happen every year.
It is part of a rethink happening globally about unrestricted tourism that brings in big dollars but damages historic sites, harms the environment and often alienates locals.
Last month, the Philippines began a six-month closure of popular Boracay Island, whose waters President Rodrigo Duterte described as a “cesspool.” Venice, the famed Italian lagoon city that lives off tourism, installed gates at two access bridges during a four-day holiday in April so it could turn back visitors if numbers became overwhelming.
Many of Thailand’s marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October during the monsoon season but because of Maya Bay’s popularity, it hasn’t had a break since a Hollywood crew set foot on its sands in 1999 to film the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland. Its corals have been decimated by the suffocating clouds of sand and sediment churned up by speedboats.
“I tried to push this campaign for many, many years, but you know in Thailand we are a tourism industry country and we need a lot of money, so before not so many people listened,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine biologist and member of a government committee on development and the environment.
“It should have been done 10 years ago but at least it has been done,” he said.
Thailand had about 35 million international visitors last year, a five-fold increase in little more than two decades.
Shi Pengfei, among the last tourists to visit Maya Bay before its closure, said he had no idea that there would be so many people on the beach.
“I feel that there are so many people here,” said Shi, from Henan, China. “The government’s plan to close off the beach for a few months is only natural because the ocean needs a break, a chance to recover, so that the next generation can have a better and even more beautiful destination.”
But locals aren’t entirely happy. The head of the Phi Phi Tourist Business Association, Watrapol Jantharo, said he was surprised when the closure was announced in March by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
He said locals were under the impression that Maya Bay would only be closed to boats, while visitors would still walk to the bay from the other side of the island.
“We are not against protecting our environment,” he said. “We know full well that Maya Bay is our important resource, like a rice field to a farmer, but we wish there are more communications about the government’s plan before the decision was made.”
Thon, however, said the plan was discussed with locals for three years before a decision was made.
“In the past, we made some mistake because we think that the money is very important. But now we are trying to change our idea,” he said. Overseas visitors are “very important to our country, but the most important thing is our national resource. We have to preserve and hand it to the next generation.”
The government has set a limit of 2,000 tourists a day when the bay reopens — about half the current number. Boats will no longer be allowed to anchor but must dock on the opposite side of the island.
“Now that the government has this plan, we can’t change it. But we could use this opportunity to tell the world that we do not just have Maya Bay. There are 10 other beautiful beaches and islands around here that tourists can enjoy,” said Watrapol.
Thailand’s efforts to protect certain islands after decades of unregulated tourism began about three years ago under the current military junta, which has banned the types of protests such moves may have sparked had they been announced by civilian governments.
Yoong Island, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Tachai Island in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off-limits to tourists since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said he was amazed by the results. Waters that were devoid of fish are now teeming, he said, and there is about 10,000 square meters (107,600 square feet) of newly recovered coral off one of the islands.
At Maya Bay, park rangers have been preparing a coral propagation program, attaching it to rocks that will be placed in the bay once the tourists are gone.
“We’re almost certain that something good will happen in Maya Bay,” Thon said.

BANGKOK: The daily hordes of tourists have exhausted the Thai beach made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie.
Maya Bay, on Phi Phi Leh island in the Andaman Sea, will be closed to all visitors for four months annually starting this June to allow for the recovery of the battered coral reefs and sea life. The decision to keep visitors away was made Wednesday by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
“It’s like someone who has been working for decades and has never stopped,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a prominent marine scientist and member of Thailand’s national strategy committee on environment development. “Overworked and tired, all the beauty of the beach is gone. We need a timeout for the beach.”
Many Thai marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October, but because of tourist demand, Maya Bay has remained open year-round since a Hollywood crew set foot there in 1999 to film “The Beach,” the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland.
The beach receives an average of 200 boats and 4,000 visitors each day. Recent surveys by a team led by marine biologists found a large part of the coral reefs around the area is gone and sea life has virtually disappeared.
Other Southeast Asian beach resorts are under threat too.
In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has vowed to close Boracay, a small central island popular for its powdery white sand beaches and vibrant nightlife, saying it has become a “cesspool.”
“Their waste would go directly to the ocean. The germ content is already very high there,” Duterte said last week. “It only looks good because of the white coastline.”
His top environmental officials say Boracay may be closed in the last week of April after a 30-day notice is issued and the tropical island placed under a state of calamity to allow the government to extend emergency funds to affected villagers and establishments.
During the closure, which could last six months or less, a massive cleanup is planned and noncompliant beach resorts and other establishments would have to install waste treatment and disposal systems to halt further contamination. Boracay drew more than 1 million tourists last year mostly from Asia, the United States and Europe.
Boracay officials may face administrative cases for allowing environmental laws to be breached for years and for failing to regulate the influx of tourists beyond the island’s capacity.
Thon said the Thai beach’s temporary closing will kick-start the rehabilitation process.
“If you ask me if it is too late to save our islands, the answer is no. But if we don’t do something today, it will be too late,” said Thanya Netithammakum, head of the National Parks and Wildlife Department.
When Maya Bay reopens, the department will set a daily limit of 2,000 tourists, while boats will no longer be allowed to anchor there and will have to dock on the opposite side of the island at floating piers.
The number of visitors the beach has been seeing is unsustainable, and a temporary closure is better than nothing, Thon said.
“The locals know that and we all know that,” he said. “This would be a good way to start managing our tourist destinations. And we can improve on what we learn after the first year. We know that it’s important we manage our resources well. It’s not about more numbers of tourists but about sustainable tourism that benefit locals as well.”
More than 35 million tourists visited Thailand last year, compared to around 10 million when “The Beach” premiered in 2000.
Thai authorities have in the past closed off islands ruined by mass tourism. Koh Yoong, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Koh Tachai, in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off limits to tourists permanently since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said the results have been amazing. Areas with a bleak sea life environment and coral bleaching are now teeming with robust and colorful sea life and coral, he said. He’s certain that the annual closure will also help restore Maya Bay.
“I have always dreamt that one day we could work to bring her back to life. I have been following and working on Maya Bay for more than 30 years. I had seen it when it was a heaven and I see it when it has nothing left. Anything that we can do to bring this paradise back to Thailand is the dream of a marine biologist,” he said.

IFEROUANE: Tuaregs in northern Niger are hoping to draw tourists back to the region by putting their traditional dances, music poetry and camel races on display.
Despite concerns about Islamic extremism throughout the Sahel region in West Africa, organizers recently hosted more than 1,000 visitors to a cultural festical in Iferouane, a village in Niger’s far north.
“Without tourism, our youth risks falling into idleness and misery, and will join the wave of migration to Europe,” said Mohamed Houma, the mayor of the town located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the central city of Agadez.
The Air festival, considered one of the most important gatherings to celebrate the culture of the Tuareg people, has been held since 2001.
It was marked last month by the sound of tende, the Tuareg style of music and drumming, as the women and men, on foot and on their camels, participated in song and dance competitions.
Since 2001, the gatherings have been held to celebrate the culture of the semi-nomadic Tuareg people. More than 2 million Tuaregs live in the Sahara Desert area, stretching across Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria and Tunisia.
Niger’s Air region, with oases, mountains and sand dunes, has been a destination for adventurous Western tourists since the 1980s and the visitors have been a financial boon for the region. But the tourism has dwindled since the Tuareg rebellion, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, and from the proliferation of armed and extremist groups in the Sahel region.
Security guards watched over the dozen French and Belgian tourists who participated this year’s in Air Festival.
“We are very happy because this festival shows the rest of the world that despite the international geopolitical and security context, we live here in peace, sheltered from the upheavals of some of our neighboring countries,” Houma said.
French tourists to the festival this year included Jacques Maire, a French legislator who heads a France-Niger Friendship group in the French National Assembly.
While the situation in Niger is tense, he said it is not the worst in the region.
“There has always been a strong French appetite for the Sahara,” said Maire. “We must seize every opportunity to recreate tourist flows.”

PHOENIX: Arizona officials on Friday guaranteed that Grand Canyon National Park will remain in full operation if Congress fails to pass a budget and a government shutdown ensues.
Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said the state’s top tourist attraction “will not close on our watch, period.”
Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak says the state’s parks and tourism agencies plan to provide up to $100,000 to ensure lodging, campgrounds and restaurants remain open, and more funding if needed.
The state agencies have been working with the National Park Service to plan for a possible shutdown as early as Saturday if Congress fails to pass a government funding bill. The House passed a temporary government funding bill Thursday night, but the Senate was deadlocked.
President Donald Trump and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer met Friday afternoon in an eleventh-hour effort to avert a shutdown. The impasse is over federal spending and legislation to protect some 700,000 younger immigrants from deportation.
“If Washington, D.C. won’t function, Arizona will,” Ducey said in a statement. “Don’t change your travel plans, because Arizona is open for business — regardless of what happens back in Congress.”
The U.S. Interior Department said national parks and other public lands will remain as accessible as possible if a shutdown happens. That’s a change from previous shutdowns, when most parks were closed and became high-profile symbols of dysfunction.
But spokeswoman Heather Swift said services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds, full-service restrooms and concessions won’t be operating in most locations.
Arizona’s decision to guarantee funding to cover the cost of those services means they should operate at the Grand Canyon as normal if a shutdown occurs.
Arizona paid about $100,000 a day to cover the full cost of keeping the Grand Canyon open during the last shutdown in 2013 but was eventually reimbursed by the federal government. Former Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, worked to pay the National Park Service $651,000 to keep the popular tourist destination open for a week. That came after a shutdown that lasted more than a week.
Federal lawmakers reached an agreement on the budget before those seven days were up.
During a 1995 shutdown, Arizona’s governor famously led a convoy of unarmed troops to the park’s gate to demand it be opened.
They were met there by the park superintendent, who negotiated with then-Gov. Fife Symington, a Republican, for a partial reopening if the budget impasse continued.
The shutdown was briefly solved, but when the parks were again closed a month later, the state paid more than $17,000 a day to keep the road to the Grand Canyon Village and the Mather Point scenic viewpoint on the canyon’s South Rim open.

LAMJUNG: A number of domestic tourists visiting a historical site of Rainaskot in Lamjung district has increased significantly.
Home stay, started after renovation of an earthquake affected houses are now packed with the domestic tourists. It is being run in a total of 14 houses which are built with the modern techniques where 84 tourists can be accommodated at once.
The concept of home stay in Rainaskot begun with American national Natasha Wajniyak providing a fund of Rs 20.75 million to renovate the quake affected houses according to Sarbodaya Old Age Home’s Chairperson Krishna Raj Oliya.
One of the home stay entrepreneurs in Rainaskot, Dilmaya Gurung informed that the domestic tourists are also provided the opportunities of observing the local cultural programs during their stay.
“Besides, tasting the local organic foods, domestic tourists also can experience the local cultures,” said Gurung. Since the Rainaskot has a big Gurung population, a museum related to that caste also has been established.
Meanwhile Rainaskot Tourism Committee’s Chairperson Khadak Bahadur Gurung expressed his hope of attracting even bigger number of the domestic tourists in the future. Visitors can reach the site after two hours of bus ride and three hours of hike from Paudi, a gateway of Lamjung district.
Mesmerizing views of 18 mountain ranges including Annapurna and Machchapuchhre can be seen from the Rainaskot.

MADRID, SPAIN:  A passenger on a delayed Ryanair flight from London who apparently got fed up waiting to get off a plane after it landed in the southern Spanish city of Malaga surprised fellow passengers by using the emergency exit to jump onto a wing.
The incident on New Year’s Day took place 30 minutes after the flight from Stansted Airport landed.
The man, who has not been named but is said to be a non-Spanish citizen, was coaxed back onto the plane while police were called.
Fellow passenger Fernando del Valle Villalobos, who videoed the incident, said he heard the man say he got fed up waiting.
“I was astonished,” del Valle, 25, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
He said the passengers were standing in the aisle waiting to get off the plane when the man “very calmly asked permission to get past, opened the emergency exit, looked out, saw the wing, went back for his back-pack.”
Later, he said the captain came out and asked the man why he had done it and del Valle heard him say clearly that he was sick of waiting inside. The passengers, except the man in question, were kept a further 15 minutes on the plane before being let off.
Police said Wednesday that they have opened a complaint against the man for breaching security.
Ryanair said the incident was now in the hands of Spanish authorities.

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA: While much of the nation shivers in bone-aching cold, people in Alaska’s largest city are basking in warmer weather, jogging in short sleeves, ice-skating in T-shirts or walking dogs while just lightly bundled up.
Anchorage saw an official high of 44 degrees Tuesday, tying the record set in 1981 and 2011. That was warm enough for Patricia Bierer, who was visiting Alaska this winter from Montana.
“I am from the Bitterroot Valley in Montana, and it’s colder there today than it is here in Alaska,” said Bierer, dressed in a pink parka as she strolled with family members around Anchorage’s Westchester Lagoon. “And my children that are there are jealous because I’ve got 40-degree temperatures here.”
National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Kurtz said areas of high and low pressure are working together to push tropical air to the north. But temperatures are expected to begin dropping Tuesday night, and below freezing by Wednesday. That freeze-thaw vacillation should bring slick conditions to the area.
“I jokingly refer to it as freezy, skid stuff,” Kurtz said.
It comes as the weather service issued wind chill advisories and freeze warnings covering a vast area, from South Texas to Canada and from Montana to Maine.

A large swath of the US is freezing under Alaska-like weather, but parts of the nation’s northernmost state itself are basking in balmy conditions. Tuesday’s official temperature hit a record 45 degrees in Anchorage. (Jan. 2)

The unseasonable temperatures brought Anchorage resident Cassandra Sullivan out to walk her pit bull Athena along downtown streets. She said it helped jolt her out of the winter blues.
“For some reason, with the weather out today as it is and just the breeze and the warm air, it kind of brings me out of it,” she said.
Ashley Durst, walking her dog at the downtown lagoon during her lunch break, admitted that the warmer weather was a little unusual because it can be minus-30 this time of the year.
But she doesn’t mind that others are feeling that bite instead. “I just think maybe it’s time they get their little taste of it for a while,” she said with a smile.

LAS VEGAS: Las Vegas welcomed 2018 with fireworks, big-ticket musical acts and unprecedented security in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in US modern history just three months ago.
Law enforcement officers kept a close eye Monday on the estimated 330,000 people who traveled from all over the US and beyond to pack in the Las Vegas Strip and downtown’s Fremont Street. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had every officer working throughout the weekend and was aided by the Nevada National Guard and federal agents.
Rosy-cheeked visitors took selfies and livestreamed the celebration amid temperatures in the mid-40s (4 Celsius), much warmer than most of the US. They wore glittery hats, tiaras and other 2018-themed paraphernalia as they hugged and cheered on the new year.
“One bad incident is not going to deter us from having a good time,” Honolulu resident Pettra Stark, who planned her trip after the Oct. 1 shooting, said while standing underneath the massive video canopy on Fremont Street.
For Stark, the heavy presence of armed officers was reassuring. But not everyone felt the same way, including Adrian Dominguez, who traveled for the festivities with 10 other relatives.
“It’s not pleasant to see so many officers,” Dominguez, a resident of the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Juarez. “They are everywhere.”
The heightened security comes after a high-stakes gambler killed 58 and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below before killing himself.
On Saturday, two security guards were fatally shot while investigating a disturbance at Arizona Charlie’s Decatur, a hotel-casino just west of the Strip. Police said the suspect was hospitalized with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities described it as an isolated incident and assured that it was not terrorism-related.
A roughly eight-minute fireworks display at the top of seven of the city’s world-famous casino-hotels started at the Stratosphere 10 seconds before midnight Monday and continued to Venetian, Treasure Island, Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Aria and MGM Grand. More than 80,000 pyrotechnic firings that illuminated the sky in gold, red and green.
Megastars performed at venues up and down the Strip. The Foo Fighters played at The Chelsea at The Cosmopolitan, Maroon 5 was at the Mandalay Bay Events Center and Britney Spears performed at The Axis at Planet Hollywood.
At a lower-key celebration in downtown Las Vegas’ casino-flanked Fremont Street Experience, bands played under a massive video canopy while visitors danced and sipped giant beers.
Las Vegas police officer Larry Hadfield on Monday said there were no incidents related to the festivities to speak of. The Nevada Highway Patrol on Twitter reported the arrest of two suspected impaired drivers near the Strip.
Police cruisers, dump trucks and other large vehicles blocked key intersections during the night to try to prevent anyone from plowing into crowds.
Strollers, backpacks, large bags, coolers and glass bottles were banned from the Strip for the night. Ticket holders for the celebration on Freemont Street Experienced went through checkpoints where security guards used hand-held metal detectors.
New Year’s Eve is worth an estimated $254.3 million to Las Vegas, according to the city’s Convention and Visitors Authority. More than 97 percent of the destination’s nearly 149,000 hotel and motel rooms were expected to be booked.

Canada is more than just its great mountains, wild moose-spotting road trips and craggy-coast good looks. Its endless variety of landscapes might keep you busy the first few days but what would a traveller look for beyond the great outdoors? Its captivating culture will engulf you; from west to east, a foodie’s paradise your palates would be thoroughly refreshed and thriving cities with their own artistic flair will surprise you. But if you’re looking to weave stories out of adventures for years to come here are a few places that you must check out.

Venture into the woods

If snuggled in a sphere suspended atop the forest canopy of Vancouver Island in the middle of nowhere is what excites you then a visit to the Free Spirit Spheres is a must. It’s part Middle Earth fantasy and part childhood dream, you’ll find large wooden orbs suspended from the trees. Take the spiral staircase and short suspension bridge leading up to them and enter into the sphere to experience nature from a different perspective.
Designed to look vaguely like enormous nuts or seeds, the cedar and spruce spheres borrow from and collaborate with the surrounding environment. The spheres are made of fibreglass and wood, and borrow heavily from sailboat construction methods. Inside the curving walls complete with portholes for windows, space is maximised with fold-out tables and mirrors, curved loft beds and benches, and tiny appliances. Touted as ‘the ultimate tree-house experience,’ these Free Spirit Spheres can be rented overnight.

Brace yourself

Mazes and labyrinths reached its zenith as a form in Renaissance England, more as a device for
entertainment than serious purpose. Today VanDusen Garden in Vancouver is one of only six in North America.
It carries on the tradition of Elizabethan hedge mazes in North America. The maze is made of 3,000 pyramidal cedars — Thuja occidentalis ‘Fastigiata’ to be specific was planted in the autumn of 1981 and slowly grown into the form of the maze one finds today.
Named after local lumber magnate and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen, this garden is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. In addition to the maze, the gardens cover 55 acres and displays plants from around the world. There is an observation terrace from which the less adventuresome visitor can view the maze and the struggles of its confused occupants.

For your eyes only

A book collector’s dream, The Monkey’s Paw in Toronto has the world’s first ‘Biblio-Mat’, a
random book vending machine.  All of the books lining the shelves of Stephen Fowler’s bookstore are ones you couldn’t possibly find anywhere else. He opened The Monkey’s Paw in March 2006 and since then it has been a haven for antiquarians, complete with
medical drawings on the wall and a stuffed crow on a typewriter.
The unusual store, named after a horror short story by author WW Jacobs, has a diverse range of old books. Fowler selects each book to fit these categories: the beautiful, the arcane, the macabre and the absurd. For some its charm may be the custom-made Biblio-Mat, a vending machine that will dispense a randomly selected vintage volume for $2, a surprise you might want to see for yourself.

Fairytale escape

An old world fairytale-land with over 350 fairy folk figurines hidden amongst 800-year old cedars is something that will surely lure you in. Artist Doris Needham and her husband Ernest needed a place to put her hand-sculpted cement creations, so they bought a forest in British Columbia and filled it with enchanted figures from fairytales and nursery rhymes.
When Rogers Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needhams’ unusual haven; one just cannot drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house.
The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage, or a favourite
nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. Take the Nature Walk, a 2-km walk through the lush Canadian forest, where you’ll discover many trees, including an 800-year-old cedar grove. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest tree house in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old
cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.

Jewel in the crown

As their contribution to Montreal’s 1967 World’s Fair Exposition the United States government
commissioned architect, scientist, and well-known genius Buckminster Fuller to design a pavilion for the Canadian exhibition.
Fuller, who popularised, perfected, and named the Geodesic Dome, designed a 20-storey-tall dome in the fashion of his hallmark design to represent the USA. Done in a full two-thirds sphere, rather than the typical half dome, the massive steel structure was seen and admired by over 5.6 million visitors who went into the dome to see exhibits from actual spaceships from the Apollo missions to American works of art.  The dome’s steel skeleton was fitted with a clear acrylic covering, making the structure look like a massive, glittering jewel.
When the fair ended, the pavilion remained, securing the dome’s place in Montreal’s landscape. This relic of the 67 Expo survived fire and ice; it was reopened and was re-purposed as a museum devoted to environmental action. Today the Biosphere of Montreal remains, a sturdy and beautiful example of ‘Bucky’s’ geodesic architecture.

Work of art

Comprised of 15,000 tonnes of snow and 500,000 tonnes of ice, the Hôtel de Glace is a massive undertaking, a stunning yet ephemeral work of art and architecture entirely built of snow and ice. Every winter, this unique hotel is completely redesigned and rebuilt, offering an unforgettable experience in the only hotel of its kind in North America.
Whether for a guided tour, a Nordic overnight stay, a wedding or a private function, the Hôtel de Glace is sure to dazzle visitors with its unique style and spellbinding décor. Guests can choose to enjoy a cocktail served in a glass made of ice or spend the night in one of the 44 theme rooms and suites and relax in the outdoor hot tubs and sauna.
Every inch of the hotel is created out of ice, including the furniture. To make the rooms more liveable, beds are covered with furs, blankets and sleeping bags tested to arctic temperatures. Although you might not get four-star service, the attraction has seduced over a million people around the world since its opening in 2001. Only 4-km from the north end of Québec City
a visit might just add to your Canada experience.  – Compiled

396,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/algeria-names-new-prime-minister/,"ALGIERS: Algeria‘s President Abdelmadjid Tebboune on Saturday named a university professor and former diplomat as prime minister as he builds a new government to handle political unrest and a looming economic challenge.
Abdelaziz Djerad, 65, served in the administration of a previous president in the 1990s, but was sidelined by president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was ousted in April after two decades as head of state.
The massive street protest movement that prompted Bouteflika to step down regarded Tebboune’s election this month as illegitimate and it seems unlikely to accept any government he appoints.
The protesters rejected any election that took place while the military stayed involved in politics and Bouteflika-era figures retained powerful positions.
Algeria‘s authorities publicly welcomed the street protests, casting them as a patriotic movement aimed at refreshing Algerian politics and ending corruption.
Djerad spoke several times on radio after the protests began, backing them and demanding that Bouteflika and his allies quit power.
Tebboune, himself a former prime minister, was one of five former senior officials approved as candidates for the presidential race, and won 58% of votes on December 12 amid protests and an electoral boycott that reduced turnout to 40%.
The opposition say that despite Tebboune’s election, ultimate power remains with the army, whose own chief, Ahmed Gaed Salah, died suddenly of a heart attack on Monday.
It leaves Algeria with a new president, prime minister and army chief during its most acute political crisis in decades. Meanwhile the country faces a longer-term slide in its trade and fiscal balances after years of lower energy prices.
With state coffers relying on energy exports for most annual revenue, the new government may be forced to make tough cuts in spending. The parliament and outgoing interim government have already agreed a 9% cut in public spending for 2020.
Other members of the new government are expected to be named in the coming days.

397,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/hong-kong-police-arrest-protesters-in-shopping-mall/,"HONG KONG: Hong Kong police arrested about a dozen protesters and used pepper spray on Saturday to break up a protest in a shopping mall aimed at disrupting retail businesses near the border with mainland China.
Demonstrators have been targeting malls across Hong Kong since earlier this week and more than a hundred protesters, many dressed in black with face masks, marched through a mall in Sheung Shui on Saturday, chanting “Go back to China”.
Sheung Shui, which is just over the border from the Chinese city of Shenzhen, is popular with so-called parallel traders who buy large volumes of duty-free goods in Hong Kong and then sell them on the mainland.
The Chinese traders have become a target for protesters in Hong Kong, who are blame them for overcrowding and pushing up prices and rents.
“Our intention is to make shops close their gates. There are many parallel traders, we want to cast them out,” said Kelly, a 17-year-old protester wearing mask.
Police wrestled one protester to the ground and pepper sprayed his face before handcuffing him. Many shops closed early and shoppers hurried out of the mall.
The protests in Hong Kong began more than six months ago in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
The demonstrations have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement and became more confrontational over the festive season.
More protests are planned in the next few days, including a countdown to New Year’s Day and a march on January 1 organised by the civil human rights front that could attract thousands.
Many protesters have been angered by what they see as the use of unnecessary force by police and have demanded an independent inquiry into the force’s behaviour.
Hong Kong police have earned a total of $17.3 million in meal and work-related allowances during the past six months of anti-government protests, government figures showed on Friday.
Demonstrators are also angry at what they perceive as increased meddling by Beijing in freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China denies interfering, saying it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula put in place at that time, and blames foreign forces for fomenting unrest.

The first one occurred 19 days into the new year when a man used an axe to kill four family members including his infant daughter. Five months later, 12 people were killed in a workplace shooting in Virginia. Twenty-two more died at a Walmart in El Paso in August.
A database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University shows that there were more mass killings in 2019 than any year dating back to at least the 1970s, punctuated by a chilling succession of deadly rampages during the summer.
In all, there were 41 mass killings, defined as when four or more people are killed excluding the perpetrator. Of those, 33 were mass shootings. More than 210 people were killed.
Most of the mass killings barely became national news, failing to resonate among the general public because they didn’t spill into public places like massacres in El Paso and Odessa, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; Virginia Beach, Virginia; and Jersey City, New Jersey.
The majority of the killings involved people who knew each other — family disputes, drug or gang violence or people with beefs that directed their anger at co-workers or relatives.
In many cases, what set off the perpetrator remains a mystery.
That’s the case with the very first mass killing of 2019, when a 42-year-old man took an ax and stabbed to death his mother, stepfather, girlfriend and 9-month-old daughter in Clackamas County, Oregon. Two others, a roommate and an 8-year-old girl managed to escape; the rampage ended when responding police fatally shot the killer.
The perpetrator had had occasional run-ins with police over the years, but what drove him to attack his family remains unknown. He had just gotten a job training mechanics at an auto dealership, and despite occasional arguments with his relatives, most said there was nothing out of the ordinary that raised significant red flags.
The incident in Oregon was one of 18 mass killings where family members were slain, and one of six that didn’t involve a gun. Among other trends in 2019:
— The 41 mass killings were the most in a single year since the AP/USA Today and Northeastern database began tracking such events back to 2006, but other research going back to the 1970s shows no other year with as many mass slayings. The second-most killings in a year prior to 2019 was 38 in 2006.
— The 211 people killed in this year’s cases is still eclipsed by the 224 victims in 2017, when the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history took place in Las Vegas.
— California, with some of the most strict gun laws in the country, had the most, with eight such mass slayings. But nearly half of U.S. states experienced a mass slaying, from big cities like New York, to tiny towns like Elkmont, Alabama, with a population of just under 475 people.
— Firearms were the weapon in all but eight of the mass killings. Other weapons included knives, axes and at least twice when the perpetrator set a mobile home on fire, killing those inside.
— Nine mass shootings occurred in a public place. Other mass killings occurred in homes, in the workplace or at a bar.
James Densley, a criminologist and professor at Metropolitan State University in Minnesota, said the AP/USA Today/Northeastern database confirms and mirrors what his own research into exclusively mass shootings has shown.
“What makes this even more exceptional is that mass killings are going up at a time when general homicides, overall homicides, are going down,” Densley said. “As a percentage of homicides, these mass killings are also accounting for more deaths. ”
He believes it’s partially a byproduct of an “angry and frustrated time” that we are living in. Densley also said crime tends to go in waves with the 1970s and 1980s seeing a number of serial killers, the 1990s marked by school shootings and child abductions and the early 2000s dominated by concerns over terrorism.
“This seems to be the age of mass shootings,” Densley said.
He and James Alan Fox, a criminologist and professor at Northeastern University, also expressed worries about the “contagion effect,” the focus on mass killings fueling other mass killings.
“These are still rare events. Clearly the risk is low but the fear is high,” Fox said. “What fuels contagion is fear.”
The mass shootings this year include the three in August in Texas and Dayton that stirred fresh urgency, especially among Democratic presidential candidates, to restrict access to firearms.
While the large death tolls attracted much of the attention, the killings inflicted a mental and physical toll on dozens of others. The database does not have a complete count of victims who were wounded, but among the three mass shootings in August alone, more than 65 people were injured.
Daniel Munoz, 28, of Odessa, was caught in the crossfire of the shooting that took place between a 10-mile (16-kilometer) stretch in West Texas. He was on his way to meet a friend at a bar when he saw a gunman and the barrel of a firearm. Instinctively, he got down just as his car was sprayed with bullets.
Munoz, who moved to Texas about a year ago to work in the oil industry, said he had actually been on edge since the Walmart shooting, which took place just 28 days earlier and about 300 miles (480 kilometers) away, worried that a shooting could happen anywhere at any time.
He remembers calling his mother after the El Paso shooting to encourage her to have a firearm at home or with her in case she needed to defend herself. He would say the same to friends, telling them before they went to a Walmart to bring a firearm in case they needed to protect themselves or others during an attack.
“You can’t just always assume you’re safe. In that moment, as soon as the El Paso shooting happened, I was on edge,” Munoz said.
Adding to his anxiety is that, as a convicted felon, he’s prohibited from possessing a firearm.
A few weeks later, as he sat behind the wheel of his car, he spotted the driver of an approaching car wielding a firearm.
“My worst nightmare became a reality,” he said. “I’m the middle of a gunfight and I have no way to defend myself.”
In the months since the self-described social butterfly steers clear of crowds and can only tolerate so much socializing. He still drives the same car, still riddled with bullet holes on the side panels, a bullet hole in the headrest of the passenger seat and the words “evidence” scrawled on the doors. His shoulder remains pocked with bullet fragments.

PERTH: Thousands of koalas are feared to have died in a wildfire-ravaged area north of Sydney, further diminishing Australia’s iconic marsupial, while the fire danger accelerated Saturday in the country’s east as temperatures soared.
The mid-north coast of New South Wales was home to up to 28,000 koalas, but wildfires in the area in recent months have significantly reduced their population. Koalas are native to Australia and are one of the country’s most beloved animals, but they’ve been under threat due to a loss of habitat.
“Up to 30% of their habitat has been destroyed,” Environment Minister Sussan Ley told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “We’ll know more when the fires are calmed down and a proper assessment can be made.”
Images shared of koalas drinking water after being rescued from the wildfires have gone viral on social media in recent days. “I get mail from all around the world from people absolutely moved and amazed by our wildlife volunteer response and also by the habits of these curious creatures,” Ley said.
About 5 million hectares (12.35 million acres) of land have burned nationwide during the wildfire crisis, with nine people killed and more than 1,000 homes destroyed.
Fire danger in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory was upgraded to severe on Saturday, as high temperatures built up over the region. Sydney’s western suburbs reached 41 degrees Celsius (106 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, while the inner city is expected to hit 31 C (88 F) on Sunday before reaching 35 C (95 F) on Tuesday.
Two wildfires in New South Wales are at the “watch and act” level issued by fire services.
Canberra, Australia’s capital, peaked at 38 C (100 F) on Saturday, with oppressive temperatures forecast for the next seven days.
Meanwhile, New South Wales Emergency Services Minister David Elliott has gone on an overseas family vacation in the wake of Prime Minister’s Scott Morrison’s much-criticized family trip to Hawaii recently.
Morrison, who apologized for going away, eventually cut short his vacation and returned to Sydney last weekend.
Elliott said he will be briefed daily while overseas. “If the bushfire situation should demand it, I will return home without hesitation,” he said.

MOGADISHU: The director of an ambulance service in Somalia’s capital says the death toll from a truck bombing has risen to at least 61.
Abdiqadir Abdirahman, the director of Aamin Ambulance, says more than 50 people were wounded.
A truck bomb exploded at a busy security checkpoint in Somalia’s capital Saturday morning, killing at least 30 people, officials said. It was one of the deadliest attacks in Mogadishu in recent memory.
The toll was likely to rise as scores of people were rushed to hospitals, government spokesman Ismail Mukhtar told The Associated Press. Mayor Omar Mohamud Mohamed, speaking at the scene, said at least 90 people were wounded, including children.
The mayor said two Turkish nationals and many university students were among those killed.
Captain Mohamed Hussein said the blast targeted a tax collection center during the morning rush hour as Somalia returned to work after its weekend. Images from the scene showed the mangled frames of vehicles and bodies lying on the ground.
A large black plume of smoke rose above the capital.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. The al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab often carries out such attacks. The extremist group was pushed out of Mogadishu several years ago but continues to target high-profile areas such as checkpoints and hotels in the seaside city.
Al-Shabab was blamed for a devastating truck bombing in Mogadishu in October 2017 that killed more than 500 people. The group never claimed responsibility for the blast that led to widespread public outrage. Some analysts said al-Shabab didn’t dare claim credit as its strategy of trying to sway public opinion by exposing government weakness had badly backfired.
The latest attack again raises concern about the readiness of Somali forces to take over responsibility for the Horn of Africa country’s security in the coming months from an African Union force.
Al-Shabab, the target of a growing number of US airstrikes since President Donald Trump took office, controls parts of Somalia’s southern and central regions. It funds itself with a “taxation” system that experts describe as extortion of businesses and travelers that brings in millions of dollars a year.

MELBOURNE: Residents of two small communities in the southern Australian state of Victoria were told to evacuate on Saturday, as a bushfire burned out of control nearby and as temperatures were set to rise.
Authorities said the fire could affect the town of Goongerah, nearly 450 km (280 miles) east of Melbourne with a population of 60 people, and the nearby community of Martins Creek over the next 48 hours and residents should leave now.
“This may be your last opportunity to do so before fire activity increases,” VicEmergency said in an alert.
“If you choose to stay, emergency services may not be able to help you.”
Cooler conditions in many parts of Australia during Christmas week helped contain some fires but temperatures are forecast to rise, once again challenging firefighters.
Temperatures in parts of South Australia rose above 40 Celsius (104 Farenheit) on Friday, while Victoria’s capital of Melbourne is forecast to hit 43C (109.4F) on Monday.
Large parts of Australia have suffered through several years of drought, creating tinder dry conditions and proving stressful to the country’s native wildlife population.
A video taken in South Australia during Friday’s extreme heat showed a koala guzzling water from a cyclist’s drink bottle after it had stopped the group of cyclists by sitting in the middle of the road.


Bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares (9.9 million acres) in five states since September and eight deaths have been linked to the blazes.
Local police said on Saturday they had charged one man for lighting a fire without a permit that caused a 40-hectare (99 acres) wildfire to start and have charged another man for allegedly deliberately lighting two bushfires.

402,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/vietnam-court-sentences-ex-minister-to-life-in-mobifone-corruption-scandal/,"
HANOI: A court in Vietnam on Saturday sentenced a former information minister to life in prison after finding him guilty of taking $3 million in bribes in connection with a controversial deal at state telecoms firm MobiFone.
Nguyen Bac Son received the money to facilitate a deal in which MobiFone overpaid for a 95% stake in a loss-making pay television provider, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement.
The court also sentenced another former information minister, Truong Minh Tuan, to 14 years in prison, accused of economic mismanagement and taking bribes in the same case, according to the statement.
MobiFone, one of Vietnam’s three largest mobile carriers by subscription, bought the stake in Audio Visual Global JSC for nearly 8.9 trillion dong ($383.7 million) in late 2015.
The government suffered “serious financial losses” as a result of the transaction, the statement said.
The MobiFone case is the largest corruption investigation so far in Vietnam’s anti-graft campaign that has already engulfed hundreds of government officials.
Audio Visual Global JSC Chairman Pham Nhat Vu was sentenced to three years in prison after being found guilty of paying the bribes to Son, Tuan, MobiFone executives and other government officials, the statement said.
The court also sentenced 11 other defendants to between two and 23 years in prison for their involvement in the case.
Reuters could not immediately reach their lawyers for comment.
A plan to sell a stake in MobiFone has long been touted as one of the most anticipated in Vietnam’s drive to privatise state-owned companies, but it has never materialised.
The government said earlier it would sell a stake of up to 50% in MobiFone by the end of 2020.

403,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/shooting-inside-suburban-denver-mall-kills-1-suspect-sought/,"AURORA, COLORADO: Gunfire broke out inside a mall in a Denver suburb on Friday, killing a 17-year-old boy and causing shoppers to scatter in search of hiding places, police officials and a witness said.
Aurora Police Department spokesman Anthony Camacho said officers were looking for at least one suspect who wielded a handgun in the shooting that occurred at 4 pm inside a JC Penney store at the Town Center at Aurora mall.
He said there was no ongoing threat inside the mall, which remained open except for the JC Penney. Yellow police tape cordoned off one entrance to the store.

“We do not believe there is a threat to the general public,” he told reporters.
Camacho said he could not immediately confirm how many people were involved in the shooting. Further details on the teenager who was killed weren’t immediately released.
It was the second shooting in the Aurora mall this month, Camacho said. A boy was injured in a Dec 14 shooting at the mall.
In March, a 16-year-old boy was shot and killed in the mall’s parking lot.
Police also responded to a call of shots fired at the mall on Nov 30, but found no evidence of a firearm.
Officers patrolling the mall on Friday responded to reports of gunfire inside the store and found the boy wounded, Camacho said. The teen was taken to a hospital, where he died.
Police were trying to determine how the shooter got away, he added. He asked anyone with information to contact police.
Shoppers were told to shelter in place as police rushed to the scene.
A witness, Jalen Martin, told The Denver Post that he was walking in the mall when he heard a noise and saw people running.
“A few of the people who were in the cluster said, ‘He’s shooting; he’s got a gun,'” Martin said.
He sprinted down an escalator and out of the mall as people ran into stores searching for places to hide, he said.
At least one police officer is assigned to the mall full-time, Camacho said. He assured residents that the mall is safe, especially during the holiday shopping season.
“We do feel that people can still come and shop here and bring their families here,” Camacho said.
The mall is in the same city where a gunman opened fire in a move theater in 2012, killing 12 people and injuring dozens more.

Speaking after what he called a fruitful meeting with Mexico’s finance ministry, Ambassador Christopher Landau said that US Attorney General William Barr would visit Mexico next month to discuss cooperation.
“What we want to do on the border is see if we can combine our customs so that, together, we can control what comes into Mexico and also what leaves Mexico and enters the United States,” Landau told reporters.
The goal is to eliminate “contraband on both sides, the drugs on one side, and the arms and money on the other,” he said.
Barr visited Mexico in early December to discuss issues including security, arms trafficking and money laundering with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and other top officials.

At least 25 people have been killed in protests across the country since the law, seen as discriminatory toward Muslims, was adopted on December 11.
The backlash against the law, pushed through parliament by the Hindu-nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is the biggest challenge he has faced since he was first elected in 2014.
Violence peaked last Friday when police clashed with protesters in several cities after weekly Muslim congregational prayers, especially in India’s most populous state of Uttar Pradesh.
With more protests expected this week, the Uttar Pradesh administration banned mobile internet services in many parts of the state, including in the provincial capital Lucknow, the state government said.
In the Uttar Pradesh city of Meerut, about 90 km (55 miles) from New Delhi, nearly 3,000 police were deployed, four times more than last Friday, the city’s police chief told Reuters.
At least five people were killed in the city last Friday.
A Reuters witness saw a riot control vehicle with a tear gas cannon mounted on its roof. A vehicle carrying a water cannon was stationed nearby as several policemen in riot gear kept watch.
“We’re working with local politicians, religious leaders and community members to appeal for calm,” Ajay Kumar Sahni, Senior Superintendent of Police in Meerut said.

“We expect the situation to remain normal.”
In the capital of New Delhi, police imposed an emergency law in some parts of the city, forbidding large gatherings, news channels reported. Such prohibitions have been in place in Uttar Pradesh for more than a week.
Despite the restrictions, thousands are expected to gather for protests after Friday prayers in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Chennai, protest organizers said.
The citizenship legislation makes it easier for minorities from India’s Muslim majority neighbours – Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan – who settled before 2015 to get citizenship.
Critics say the exclusion of Muslims is discriminatory and that the award of citizenship based on religion violates India’s secular constitution.
Muslims, India’s second biggest community by religion, account for about 14% of its 1.3 billion people.
The protests have come as India’s economic growth has slumped to its lowest in more than six years and unemployment remains high.

SHANGHAI: A firm run by the daughter of Bruce Lee has sued a Chinese fast food for using the late kungfu star’s image in its logo without permission and is seeking over 210 million yuan ($30 million) in compensation, Chinese media outlet The Paper reported.
California-based Bruce Lee Enterprises, whose head is Shannon Lee, filed the case against the Real Kungfu chain in a Shanghai court on Wednesday, requesting that the food firm stop using the image and pay an additional 88,000 yuan to cover legal expenses.
It also asked that the Guangzhou-based chain to issue clarifications for 90 days to say that it has nothing to do with Bruce Lee. Real Kungfu, which sells rice bowls with Chinese dishes, was founded in 1990 and has outlets in over 57 Chinese cities.
Its logo is of a man dressed in a yellow long-sleeved top whose looks and stance are similar to Bruce Lee and his famed ‘ready to strike’ pose.
Real Kungfu on its Weibo account on Thursday said it was “puzzled” by the lawsuit as it had used that logo for the last 15 years. It said that while there had been some issues in the past, its use of the logo was approved by national authorities.
The filing of the case comes as China has pledged to improve protection for intellectual property rights and apply stiffer penalties, one of the key topics in Beijing’s trade dispute with the United States.

407,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/japan-oks-divisive-plan-to-send-naval-troops-to-mideast/,"TOKYO: Japan on Friday approved a contentious plan to send its naval troops to the Middle East to ensure the safety of Japanese ships transporting oil to the energy-poor country that heavily depends on imports from the region.
The Cabinet’s decision reflects tensions that have escalated between Iran and the US since President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal.
“Taking into consideration the escalating tension in the Middle East, it is necessary to strengthen our information gathering effort,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide suga told a news conference. Citing Japan’s heavy dependence on oil imports from the region, Suga added that “it is extremely important to secure the safe navigation of Japan-affiliated ships.”

Despite being a US ally, Japan’s troop dispatch is not part of a US-led coalition protecting Middle East waterways, apparently an attempt to maintain neutrality in a show of consideration to Iran.
Under the plan, Japan will send about 260 Maritime Self-Defense Force personnel with a destroyer and a pair of P-3C reconnaissance aircraft, mainly for intelligence-gathering in the Gulf of Oman, the Arabian Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait connecting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
Defense Minister Taro Kono issued an order for the troops to start preparing for the operation, which is planned for one year beginning early next year.
Kono is to visit Djibouti on the eastern coast of Africa and Oman this weekend to discuss Japan’s mission. Japanese troops have been based in Djibouti as part of an international anti-piracy effort off the Somali coast, and a P-3C unit currently in that operation will be shifted to the new mission in January, he said.
Japan will stay away from the Strait of Hormuz, where the US-led coalition is operating.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe explained the plan to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani when he visited Tokyo last week.
Japan, which has friendly ties with both Iran and the US, also seeks to serve as a mediator between the two and play a greater role in restoring stability in the region, officials said.
The Middle East supplies more than 80% of Japan’s oil needs.
Sending warships to areas of military tension is a highly sensitive issue in Japan because its pacifist post-World War II constitution limits the use of force by the military strictly to self-defense. Abe, however, has gradually expanded Japan’s military role in recent years.
In June, a Japanese-operated tanker was attacked in the Gulf of Oman. Washington said Iran was responsible and urged Japan to join the US-led military initiative.
Petroleum Association of Japan Chairman Takashi Tsukioka welcomed a troop dispatch in a statement: “The Middle East situation continues to be uncertain and we believe it will contribute to the safety of ship navigation in the Middle East.”

The Fokker 100 aircraft heading for the capital Nur-Sultan on a pre-dawn flight “lost altitude during takeoff and broke through a concrete fence”, before hitting a two-storey building, Kazakhstan’s Civil Aviation Committee said.

A survivor told news website Tengrinews she heard a “terrifying sound” before the plane started losing altitude.
“The plane was flying with a tilt. Everything was like in a movie: screaming, shouting, people crying,” she said.
A Reuters reporter travelling to the airport soon after the crash said there was thick fog in the area.
Authorities have not suggested any possible cause of the accident. The aviation committee said it was suspending all flights by carrier Bek Air and those of Fokker 100 aircraft pending an investigation.
Bek Air, which operates a fleet of Fokker 100 jets, said in a statement it was awaiting official information from the investigators working at the crash site.
Another survivor, businessman Aslan Nazaraliyev, told the Vremya newspaper the plane started shaking while gaining altitude about two minutes after takeoff.
“At some point we started falling, not vertically, but at an angle. It seemed like control over the plane was lost,” he said.
At least 15 people were killed, and 66 were taken to hospital, including some in grave condition, municipal authorities said.

The government said the crashed plane was produced in 1996 and its most recent flight certificate was issued in May 2019.
Kazakhstan’s interior ministry said it was investigating a possible breach of flight operations and safety rules.

411,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/death-toll-reaches-28-as-philippines-recovers-from-christmas-typhoon/,"MANILA: The death toll from a Christmas typhoon that tore through the central Philippines rose to 28 on Friday, with 12 people missing, the disaster agency said, as authorities moved to restore power and residents tried to repair damaged homes.

Typhoon Phanfone hit late on Tuesday with winds of up to 120 kph (75 mph) and gusts of 150 kph, dumping sheets of uninterrupted rain on a string of islands, damaging hundreds of homes and causing flooding in eight areas.

It was the seventh typhoon to strike the Philippines this year and came as millions of people in the predominantly Catholic country were heading home to celebrate Christmas with families.
Some 43,000 people were in temporary shelters on Friday, among the 185,000 impacted by the typhoon, which destroyed 49 homes and partially damaged 2,000.
There was widespread travel disruption with 115 flights cancelled and thousands of people stranded by the suspension of ferries due to storm surges.
It was unclear how the deaths occurred, but officials said some were hit by trees, electrocuted or drowned.
“People did not expect that the storm would be that devastating,” said disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal.
Though less powerful than other typhoons this year, Phanphone made landfall in some of the country’s poorest and least-developed islands.
Among them was the island of Samar, which bore the brunt of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, the Philippines‘ most powerful and deadliest storm on record. It killed more than 6,300 people.
Residents there were clearing debris, with wooden pillars and sheets of corrugated iron roof that were once homes, scattered across the ground. Men pulled tried to recover fishing boats with tangled or damaged outriggers.
Samar resident Virgilo Catayas, whose sibling was among those killed by Haiyan, said he lost another to hypertension when Phanphone hit.
“We can’t really do much if that’s what happened, we’ll have to accept it,” he told broadcaster ABS-CBN. “The important thing is to stay strong,” he said, sitting next to a casket.
Television showed minor damage to the airport at Kalibo, an alternative gateway to the holiday island of Boracay, while the disaster agency said 55 schools had suffered some damage.
The agriculture department estimated initial damages of 569 million pesos ($11.17 million) mostly to fish farms.
Images on social media showed government workers clearing trees from roads, with a clear blue sky after the storm moved out over the South China Sea late on Wednesday.

412,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/israels-embattled-netanyahu-wins-landslide-in-primary/,"JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday scored a landslide victory in a primary race for leadership of the ruling Likud party, giving the embattled leader an important boost ahead of the country’s third election in less than a year.
The strong showing by Israel’s longest-serving leader could give him another opportunity to form a government following the March election, after falling short in two previous attempts this year. By easily fending off Likud lawmaker Gideon Saar, Netanyahu also kept alive his hopes of winning immunity from prosecution after being indicted last month on a series of corruption charges.
“A giant victory,” Netanyahu tweeted early Friday, just over an hour after polls closed.
“Thanks to the members of Likud for the trust, support and love,” he added. “God willing, I will lead Likud to a big victory in the coming elections.”
In a tweet, Saar congratulated Netanyahu and said he would support the prime minister in the national election. “I am absolutely comfortable with my decision to run,” he added. “Whoever isn’t ready to take a risk for the path he believes in will never win.”
Official results released by Likud showed Netanyahu capturing 41,792 votes, or 72%, compared with 15,885 votes, or 28%, for Saar.
While removing any doubts about Netanyahu’s standing in the ruling party, the primary is likely to prolong Israel’s political uncertainty. Netanyahu will remain at the helm of Likud through the March elections, and his lingering legal troubles could again scuttle efforts to form a government after that.
In September’s election, both Likud and its main rival, the centrist Blue and White party, were unable to secure a parliamentary majority and form a government on their own.

The two parties together captured a solid majority of parliamentary seats, leaving a national unity government as the best way out of the crisis. But Blue and White has refused to sit in a partnership with Netanyahu when he is under indictment.
Opinion polls predict a similar outcome in the March election, raising the possibility of months of continued paralysis. The country already has been run by a caretaker government for the past year.
Netanyahu, who has led the country for the past decade, maintained his position atop the political right by cultivating an image as a veteran statesman with close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other world leaders.
His refusal to make any concessions to the Palestinians was rewarded after Trump took office, as the U.S. began openly siding with Israel on several key issues, validating Netanyahu’s approach in the eyes of many Israelis and adding to his mystique.
Netanyahu’s hard-line approach to Iran has also proved popular. He was a staunch opponent of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which has unraveled since Trump withdrew from the agreement. A wave of Israeli strikes on Iran-linked targets in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq has burnished Netanyahu’s claims to having protected Israel from its enemies.
His fortunes have nevertheless waned over the past year, after he was unable to form a government following the unprecedented back-to-back elections in March and September. His party came in second place in September, leading many observers to view the vote as the beginning of the end.
In November, Netanyahu was indicted on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes, the culmination of three long-running corruption investigations. Netanyahu vowed to remain in office, dismissing the indictment as an “attempted coup” by hostile media and law enforcement.
Reuven Hazan, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said the victory for Netanyahu would have no impact on the general election.
“It simply means that he’s managed to maintain control of the party,” he said. “It just means that the faithful have circled the wagons. It means nothing for the elections except that he looks good. He looks strengthened.”
Netanyahu appeared rejuvenated in recent weeks as he hit the campaign trail, doing several live events a day where he rallied supporters in small gatherings and face-to-face meetings.
“The Likudniks have witnessed an astonishing event play out in the past two weeks, in which a 70-year-old leader who has had his fill of terms in office has thrown himself at every last registered party member,” Israeli columnist Ben Caspit wrote in the Maariv daily.
The approach appears to have paid off and may serve as a template for a more effective general election campaign. In the meantime, Israel will remain in limbo for at least another two months.
Netanyahu, who also served as prime minister in the late 1990s, is desperate to remain in office, where he is best positioned to fight the corruption charges. Israeli law requires public officials to resign if charged with a crime. But the law does not apply to sitting prime ministers.
As long as he remains in office, Netanyahu can use the position as a bully pulpit to criticize his prosecutors. He also can offer political favors in hopes of rallying a majority of lawmakers who favor granting him immunity from prosecution.
“His game is to be prime minister because that is a shield from indictment,” Hazan said.
Despite the victory, Netanyahu has many hurdles ahead.
The Supreme Court is set next week to begin considering whether an indicted member of parliament can be tasked with forming a new government. Its decision could potentially disqualify Netanyahu from leading the next government. It’s not clear when a ruling would be handed down.
The political uncertainty has led the Trump administration to delay the release of its long-anticipated Mideast peace plan.
The Palestinians have already rejected the plan, saying the administration is hopelessly and unfairly biased toward Israel. They point to Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, to cut off virtually all aid to the Palestinians and to reverse longstanding opposition to Jewish settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, which Israel captured in the 1967 war.
Meanwhile, Netanyahu has said Israel is on the cusp of securing U.S. support for the annexation of large parts of the occupied West Bank — but only if he remains in power.
That would virtually extinguish the Palestinians’ hopes of one day establishing an independent state, but it would cement Netanyahu’s legacy as perhaps the most successful right-wing leader in the country’s history.

SINGAPORE: Thousands of skywatchers gathered across parts of the Middle East and Asia on Thursday to glimpse the sun forming a ring of fire around the moon in a rare annular solar eclipse.
An annular eclipse occurs when the moon covers the sun’s centre but leaves its outer edges visible to form a ring.


Thursday’s was visible in Saudi Arabia as well as Singapore, India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
“This will be the first of only two annular eclipses visible from Singapore for the rest of the century. So in that sense, it’s a very rare event for us,” said Albert Ho, president of the Astronomical Society of Singapore. The island’s next will be in 2063.
In most years, two solar eclipses are visible from somewhere on Earth. The maximum number is five.

Typhoon Phanfone hit the Philippines late on Tuesday with winds of up to 120 kph (75 mph) and gusts of 150 kph, heavy rain and flooding.

More than 58,000 people were evacuated from their homes before the storm, which caused widespread property damage, and more than 15,000 were stranded at ports when ferries were suspended. Scores of flights were cancelled.
The fatalities were in the central provinces of Capiz, Iloilo and Leyte, including a 13-year-old boy who was electrocuted, a man killed by a tree branch and another killed in a car accident, the disaster agency said.
The typhoon left the Philippines on Wednesday night and was out over the South China Sea, moving west.
An average of 20 typhoons hit the Philippines each year, with storms becoming fiercer in recent years.

On the morning after Christmas Day in 2004, a 9.1 magnitude quake off northern Sumatra island triggered a tsunami with waves as high as 17.4 meters (57 feet) that swept over vulnerable coastal areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and nine other countries.
“It still haunts me … I can remember it all the time,” said Suwannee Maliwan, 28, who lost both parents and five other relatives when the tsunami hit the Thai province of Phang Nga.
“Sometimes I dream that a wave is coming. I’m still scared,” she said. “Sometimes I want to move somewhere else, but it’s not possible because I was born here, my mom and dad passed away here.”

Memorials were scheduled in the Indonesian province of Aceh, where entire villages were flattened and more than 125,000 people perished in the giant waves. Since then, the area has been largely rebuilt, with some 25,600 residential, commercial, government and school buildings constructed inside a high-risk zone, that had suffered virtually total devastation in 2004.
In Thailand, where more than 5,300 people were killed, including tourists visiting resort islands in the Andaman Sea, officials held a memorial ceremony and called for more awareness and preparedness for disasters.
“The government wants to lift safety standards… and build awareness across all sectors in preparing and protecting people against disasters,” Deputy Interior Minister, Nipon Bunyamanee, said at an opening ceremony. He said Dec. 26 had been designated national accident prevention day.
Officials later laid wreaths at a memorial center in Phang Nga province to pay tribute to King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s nephew, Bhumi Jensen, who was last seen jet-skiing off the coast when the tsunami hit.
An interfaith service for Muslim, Christian and Buddhist victims was also scheduled.
Survivors from Ban Nam Khem, the worst hit Thai village, will hold a candlelight vigil in the evening. At least 1,400 people were killed when waves struck the fishing village.
In India, where more than 10,000 people died in the tsunami, survivors also were to hold memorial ceremonies. More than 35,000 people died in Sri Lanka.

“We will be having a signing ceremony, yes,” Trump told reporters. “We will ultimately, yes, when we get together. And we’ll be having a quicker signing because we want to get it done. The deal is done, it’s just being translated right now.”
United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on December 13 that representatives from both countries would sign the Phase 1 trade deal agreement in the first week of January.
Speaking in Beijing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said both countries were in close contact.
“Both sides’ economic and trade teams are in close communication about detailed arrangements for the deal‘s signing and other follow-up work,” Geng told a daily news briefing.
He did not elaborate.
Beijing has not yet confirmed specific components of the deal that were released by US officials. A spokesman for China‘s Commerce Ministry said last week the details would be made public after the official signing.

417,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/afghan-official-says-taliban-abducted-26-peace-activists/,"KABUL: The Taliban ambushed a peace convoy in western Afghanistan and abducted 26 activists, members of a peace movement, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
The insurgents staged the ambush in the district of Bala Buluk in Farah province on Tuesday. The Taliban forced the six-vehicle convoy to a halt, then got into the cars and drove them and the activists to an unknown location, said the provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib.
According to Mohib, a police operation is underway to locate and free the activists whose convoy was going village-to-village to rally for peace.
However, Bismillah Watandost of the People’s Peace Movement of Afghanistan, to which the activists belong, said that 27 of their members were abducted by the Taliban in the Farah assault. The different figures could not immediately be reconciled.
The Taliban, who have been active in Farah, have not claimed responsibility for the abductions. However, Watandost also said that tribal elders in the province immediately launched an effort to negotiate with the Taliban to release the abducted activists. He added that phone lines were down in the region, making communication and getting information from the area difficult.

The Taliban today hold sway or control practically half of Afghanistan and are at their strongest since the 2001 US-invasion. They continue to stage near-daily attacks targeting Afghan and US forces, as well as government officials — even as they hold peace talks with a US envoy tasked with negotiating an end to the 18-year conflict, America’s longest war.
The latest rallies by the activists from the People’s Peace Movement of Afghanistan started on Friday, first in southern Helmand province, a Taliban heartland.
At a similar series of peace rallies in October, the Taliban abducted six activists from the movement in eastern Logar province but released them the same day.

418,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/israeli-pm-evacuated-from-rally-after-rocket-fired-from-gaza/,"JERUSALEM: Israel said a rocket was fired from the Gaza Strip into its southern territory Wednesday, forcing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be hustled from a stage during an election rally in the city of Ashkelon.
The Israeli military said its air defense system, known as Iron Dome, intercepted the rocket. There were no reports of casualties.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz posted a video on its website showing Netanyahu being taken to a shelter as he was campaigning hours before the primaries of his Likud party. The video showed Netanyahu and his wife slowly walking off the stage with security guards after sirens went off.
Early Thursday, Israeli fighter jets and helicopters carried out multiple strikes at three military bases for Hamas, the Islamic movement that rules Gaza, according to witnesses in Gaza. No casualties were reported as the sites have been empty.
There was no immediate comment from Israel’s military.
Netanyahu says he knows how to protect Israel, but opponents accuse him of being soft on handling threats from Gaza.
Gideon Saar, Netanyahu’s challenger in Thursday elections, called in a Twitter statement for a “broad national consensus for dismantling the military infrastructure” of Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
A similar incident happened in September when Netanyahu was in the nearby city of Ashdod. He was campaigning then for the second general Israeli election of the year. That was believed to have triggered Israel’s targeted killing of a senior commander in the Islamic Jihad in November. Israel and Gaza militants had their worst round of fighting in months as a result.
No Palestinian group claimed responsibility for Wednesday’s attack. Such sporadic launches of rockets and ensuing Israeli airstrikes have happened frequently despite an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire that ended two days of fighting in November.
Hamas seeks “understandings” with Israel to alleviate Gaza’s economic and humanitarian crises. The militant group stayed on the sidelines during the November flare-up.

Police in High Point, North Carolina, searched for clues and suspects on Wednesday in a spate of shootings that have left two people dead and seven others wounded over two days, including a Christmas Eve drive-by attack outside a strip mall.
Tuesday afternoon’s burst of gunfire from a passing car on a group of about a dozen people gathered in a parking lot outside the shopping strip sent six men to the hospital, three of them initially listed in critical condition, police said.
By Wednesday, all six victims were listed in stable condition, but investigators had yet to identify any suspects or the vehicle involved, High Point Police Department Captain Chris Weisner told Reuters.
Even the gender of the two individuals in the car – a driver and passenger – remained uncertain, he said.
In addition, Weisner said, investigators were looking into the possibility that Wednesday’s drive-by attack was connected to a separate shooting the night before in which one of two victims, a man aged 27, died the next day.
“There’s no known connection, but they’re looking to see if there is a link” between the two shootings, the police captain said, adding that no arrests had been made in either incident.
A third shooting that killed an 18-year-old victim early on Christmas Eve is believed to be an isolated incident, according to Weisner. He said “some arrests” were made in that investigation on Wednesday but declined to give further details.
Weisner acknowledged that the flurry of gun violence was unusual in such “a short time frame” for High Point, a municipality of about 112,000 people that lies between Winston-Salem and Greensboro in the Piedmont Triad region of North Carolina.
High Point, long known as a manufacturing hub in the state’s once-vibrant furniture industry, has been hit hard economically over the past two decades by competition from abroad and from elsewhere in the United States.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong anti-government protesters marched through Christmas-decorated shopping centres on Wednesday, chanting pro-democracy slogans and forcing one mall to close early, as police fired tear gas to disperse crowds gathering on nearby streets.
The protests have turned more confrontational over the festive season, though earlier in December they had been largely peaceful after pro-democracy candidates overwhelmingly won district council elections.
Hong Kong‘s pro-Beijing leaders have made no concessions to the protesters, despite acknowledging their defeat in November’s council elections.
“Confrontation is expected, it doesn’t matter if it’s Christmas,” said Chan, a 28-year-old restaurant worker who was part of a crowd which exchanged insults with police outside a shopping centre in the Mong Kok district.
“I’m disappointed the government still didn’t respond to any of our … demands. We continue to come out even if we don’t have much hope,” said Chan, who only gave his surname.
Riot police patrolled past protest hotspots while tourists and shoppers, many wearing Santa hats or reindeer antlers, strolled past.
There were no major clashes, but with impromptu crowds forming to shout abuse at the deeply unpopular officers, who have been accused of using excessive force, police briefly fired tear gas in Mong Kok, a popular protest area.
Police say their reaction to the unrest has been restrained.
Hundreds of protesters, dressed in black and wearing face masks, descended on shopping malls around the Chinese-ruled city, shouting popular slogans such as “Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!”
Police arrested several people in a shopping mall in the Sha Tin district after pepper-spraying them. The mall closed early, with staff directing customers to leave. Other shopping centres remained open.
Baton-wielding police fired tear gas on Tuesday at thousands of protesters who barricaded roads, spray-painted slogans on buildings and trashed a Starbucks cafe and an HSBC branch. A water cannon truck, flanked by armoured jeeps, roamed the streets, but was not heavily used.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that many members of the public and tourists were disappointed that their “Christmas Eve celebrations have been ruined”.
“Such illegal acts have not only dampened the festive mood but also adversely affected local businesses,” she said.
INJURED OVERNIGHT
The Hospital Authority said 25 people had been injured overnight, including one man who fell from the second to first floor of a shopping mall as he tried to escape the police.
HSBC has become embroiled in a controversy involving a police crackdown this month on a fund-raising platform supporting protesters. HSBC denied any connection between the crackdown and its closure of a bank account linked to the group, but remains the target of protester rage.
Starbucks has also become a target of the demonstrators’ anger after the daughter of the founder of Maxim’s Caterers, which owns the local franchise, publicly condemned the protesters.
The protests started more than six months ago against a now-withdrawn bill which would have allowed extraditions to mainland China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
They have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement, with demonstrators angry at what they perceive as increased meddling by Beijing in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China denies interfering, saying it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula put in place at that time and blaming foreign forces for fomenting unrest.

MANILA: Christmas turned to chaos for many holiday observers in the central Philippines as a typhoon with strong winds and heavy rains destroyed homes, cut off power and stranded travellers, disaster officials said on Wednesday.
Typhoon Phanfone, rated category 2 by Tropical Storm Risk, was packing maximum sustained winds of 120 km per hour (75 miles per hour) with gusts up to 150 kph when it made landfall in the eastern province of Samar on Tuesday, weather and disaster officials said.

More than 4,000 people have been evacuated in the Eastern Visayas region of the central Philippines, disaster officials said, although no deaths have been reported.
Images posted by Paul Cinco, a resident of Tanauan, Leyte province, showed strong gusts and damage caused overnight.
“The aftermath of course made us sad because it’s Christmas Day, but it doesn’t feel like Christmas, but we’re blessed to be safe…no major devastation or casualties reported,” he said.
More than 20,000 passengers and 157 vessels were stranded in ports on Wednesday, and at least 60 domestic flights have been cancelled. Local media reported that 100 homes in the path of the storm were destroyed overnight.
An average of 20 typhoons cross the Philippines each year, with storms becoming fiercer in recent years. More than 6,000 people died and 200,000 homes destroyed when Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest-ever storm to make landfall in the Philippines, hit the central islands of Leyte and Samar six years ago. Phanfone, which gained strength as it barrelled through the central region, is expected to exit the country on Thursday.

423,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/it-takes-a-tech-village-to-track-santa-on-christmas-eve/,"PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE, COLORADO: Depending on which country they’re from, the kids may ask about Father Christmas, Papa Noel, Saint Nick or Santa Claus.
But those who believe all want to know one thing: where in the world the jolly old man and his sleigh full of gifts are on Christmas Eve.

For the 64th time, a wildly popular program run by the G and Canadian militaries is providing real-time updates on Santa’s progress to millions around the globe.
And this year, the North American Aerospace Defense Command is offering even more high-tech ways for children and parents to follow along.
Operation NORAD Tracks Santa has evolved from a misdirected telephone call in 1955, to a trailer parked outside the command’s former lair deep inside Cheyenne Mountain, to NORAD ‘s modern-day headquarters at Colorado’s Peterson Air Force Base.
Along the way, the tens of thousands of telephone calls fielded by NORAD volunteers each year have been augmented by an explosion of technology that lets millions track St. Nick’s journey from the North Pole to the Pacific and Asia, from Europe to the Americas.
This year’s portals include Alexa, OnStar, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and 3-D apps developed for mobile devices by Cesium, a Philadelphia-based IT and defense contractor. The apps integrate geospatial and satellite-positioning technology with high-resolution graphics that display the actual positions of the stars, sun and moon and the shadows they cast at any point in Santa’s journey.
It takes a village of dozens of tech firms — including Google, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and Bing Maps — to deliver the immersive effect for global Santa trackers, with some 15 million visits to the website alone last year.
And it takes a village of 1,500 volunteers to field emails and the 140,000 or so telephone calls to 1-877-HI-NORAD (1-877-446-6723). They staff phone banks equipped with monitors inside a building at Peterson, which offers a view of snow-capped Pikes Peak to the west.
More volunteers and firms donate food, water and coffee to those on Santa Watch.
“Hi Santa Trackers! Lots of kids are waiting to ask you about Santa,” a sign reads.
Volunteers are equipped with an Operations Center Playbook that helps ensure each and every caller can go to sleep happy and satisfied on Christmas Eve.
Longtime Santa trackers are familiar with the NORAD-Santa story.
In 1955, Air Force Col Harry Shoup — the commander on duty one night at NORAD’s predecessor, the Continental Air Defense Command — fielded a call from a child who dialed a misprinted telephone number in a newspaper department store ad, thinking she was calling Santa.
A fast-thinking Shoup quickly assured his caller that he was. And a tradition was born.
Today, most early calls come from Japan and Europe. The volume soars in the US and Canada, said program manager Preston Schlachter. United Kingdom callers ask about Father Christmas. Those in France generally seek Papa Noel’s whereabouts.
For team members, once “Big Red” — Santa’s code name — is airborne, Schlachter said, “it’s off to the races.”
“I’ve never had a block of time move so quickly,” he said.
