FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

2,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

3,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

4,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

The ordinance will now be sent to the President for certification.
The Authority, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister, is being set up prior to the international donors’ conference, scheduled for June 25, which aims at seeking support from the international communities to rebuild Nepal.
When the ordinance is certified, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala will nominate four ministers and three experts as members of the high-level body, according to Minister for General Administration Lalbabu Pandit.
Likewise, Vice-Chairperson of the National Planning Commission and Chief Secretary will be members of the Authority.
The post-earthquake Reconstruction Authority will have a chief executive officer also. It will oversee all reconstruction works in the earthquake-hit districts where physical infrastructures have been damaged.
Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam informed that there will be a separate committee of foreign consultants that would be constantly supporting the Authority in its job.
According to the government’s assessment, the tremors caused damage worth Rs 513.38 billion to physical infrastructure and assets, and inflicted income loss of another Rs 187.08 billion.
The government has set the target to collect more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors for the post-earthquake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
 Objectives of International Conference on Nepal’s Reconstruction

KATHMANDU: The government has set the target to garner more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors’ conference being organised on June 25 for the post-quake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
A study of losses caused by the devastating Gorkha Quake on April 25 and its aftershocks in various regions across the country shows that physical infrastructures worth Rs 512 billion were damaged by the quake and over Rs 666 billion was needed for reconstruction, rehabilitation and new construction.
The government is preparing to collect the assistance by presenting the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) report in the conference prepared by the National Planning Commission for the same.
According to the PDNA report, over Rs 399 billion is necessary for reconstruction and rehabilitation tasks in cultural heritage, education, health and human settlement sectors.
Similarly, Rs 117 billion is needed for reconstruction of agriculture, industry, irrigation and tourism sectors.
Likewise, the PDNA report estimates that it will cost Rs 74.26 billion for reconstruction of media, community infrastructures, hydropower, transport and drinking water and sanitation sectors while Rs 75.11 billion to recover the damaged gender, social security, nutrition, employment, environment and forest areas into previous position.

Issuing a press statement, MoALD has cited the reason for the slight drop in production of paddy to delay in plantation of the crop, delayed monsoon, armyworms infestation, among others.
The drop in paddy production, however, has largely been attributed to supply of faulty Garima brand paddy that did not yield rice grains across the country, including in Chitwan, Rautahat, Nawalparasi, Nuwakot, Lamjung, Gorkha and Tanahun districts. The Garima brand paddy was planted across 1,500 hectares of land, affecting production of almost 8,500 tonnes of paddy.
Compared to the last fiscal year, paddy production has dropped in Province 2, Province 3, Gandaki Province and Lumbini Province, while the output of the cereal crop has increased slightly in other provinces. Paddy production has increased by 0.6 per cent each in Province 1 and Karnali
Province to 1.24 million tonnes and 134,407 metric tonnes, respectively. Similarly, paddy output has increased by 6.7 per cent compared to last year’s production in Sudurpaschim Province to 646,059 metric tonnes.
However, production of the crop this year dropped by five per cent to 1.42 million tonnes in Province 2; 2.2 per cent to 510,210 metric tonnes in Province 3; 4.4 per cent to 408,737 tonnes in Gandaki Province and 0.3 per cent to 1.18 million tonnes in Lumbini Province, as per MoALD.

The Investment Board Nepal (IBN) has completed the pre-qualification process of 14 projects worth Rs 1.18 trillion that investors showed interest in at the Investment Summit held in March last year.
Among the projects whose pre-qualification process has been completed, IBN has already selected the company to conduct the detailed feasibility study (DFS) of the 756-megawatt Tamor Hydropower Project. Similarly, IBN has also inked the initial investment agreement with Korean company Motrex to set up a vehicle manufacturing and assembly plant project worth Rs 10.54 billion.
Of the 77 projects that the government had showcased at the country’s flagship Nepal Investment Summit held in March, investors had submitted expression of interest (EoI) for 31 different projects amounting to more than $25.3 billion. IBN today had organised a press conference to highlight the progress made in these projects.
Addressing the press conference, IBN’s Chief Executive Officer Maha Prasad Adhikari informed that the board is continuously inking pacts with investors who had expressed their interest in projects showcased at the investment summit.
IBN has also inked an agreement with a foreign firm to develop the Rs 64.6 billion worth Nepal-China Friendship Park Project in Province 1. Similarly, IBN has also inked an agreement with two separate companies to conduct the DFS for developing the Rs 13 billion worth Multi-Model Logistic Parks in Biratnagar, Birgunj and Bhairahawa.
“IBN today is in the phase of implementing nine different projects worth Rs 565 billion. Of this, development of Arun-III hydroelectric project is ongoing, while Hongshi Cement will soon start the second phase of production,” informed Adhikari.
On the occasion, IBN officials hinted that the board has been facing hassles in approving projects in a timely manner following a few difficult legal processes, which the board expects the government will address in the near future.

The price of gold in the domestic market hit a new high today on fuel war fears.
As per the price list of Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association (FeNeGoSiDA), gold was traded in the domestic market today at Rs 74,500 per tola, a steep rise of Rs 1,000 a tola overnight.
The tensions between Iran and the US heightened today after the Iranian Quds Force chief Major-General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed in a US airstrike at the Baghdad International Airport in the morning. This prompted international investors to flock towards gold, which is considered a safe haven investment at times of turmoil. Hence, the gold price went up in the domestic market, FeNeGoSiDA stated.
The gold prices went up twice during this trading week between December 29 and January 3.
The federation has stated that the gold price was also hit by the expensive dollar — Rs 114.50 today — in the domestic market.
The earlier peak for the bullion — at Rs 73,500 per tola — was first recorded on August 26 last year. Even as its price had bobbed thereafter, the precious yellow metal had reached this level a number of times, most recently on Thursday.
The soaring price of the bullion has dented its demand in the local market, with jewellers complaining of muted business even during the festive and wedding seasons.
As per FeNeGoSiDA, per day gold trade has fallen to 10 kg from 25 kg in this period last year. Amidst this, the import of gold and silver has declined significantly in the current fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal 2018-19.
According to the Department of Customs, a total of 1,250 kg of gold was imported in the first five months of the current fiscal, a staggering 61.78 per cent drop compared to the import of 3,271 kg of the precious yellow metal in the corresponding period of last fiscal.

The government has awarded Fitch Ratings, a United States-based international credit rating agency, to study and confirm Nepal’s sovereign credit rating.
Of the three rating agencies that had expressed interest to conduct the country’s sovereign credit rating, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has assigned the task to Fitch Ratings, informed Uttar Kumar Khatri, spokesperson for the Finance Ministry.
Along with Fitch Ratings, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s were the two other credit rating agencies that had expressed interest to gauge Nepal’s credit worthiness.
As per Khatri, Fitch Ratings is carrying out works related to the sovereign rating in coordination with the Department for International Development (DFID), United Kingdom.
“Fitch has already started collecting necessary statistics and documents to calculate and determine the country’s rating. We have asked the agency to complete the credit rating process by the end of the ongoing fiscal year,” informed Khatri.
Sovereign credit rating determines the trustworthiness of the business environment and credit risk of a potential debtor, an individual, company, business, government or any other sovereign entity.
Such rating gives potential investors an insight into the level of risk while investing in a country and takes into account political, social and financial risks.
Risk ranking of a country is the primary factor that the potential investors look at before investing in any country.
With anticipation that the level of risk in doing business in Nepal has reduced in recent years, the government expects the country’s credit rating to be crucial in bringing foreign investment.
Stephen Schwartz, head of Sovereign Ratings Asia Pacific of Fitch Ratings, had informed The Himalayan Times in an interview last year that Nepal is comparing relatively well with its peers on macroeconomic indicators like growth and inflation, but lags behind in structural indicators, meaning low level of per capita income, and in governance indicators.
Fitch Ratings conducts the credit rating of a country based on its macroeconomic, structural and governance indicators.

12,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/latest-procurement-guidelines-amendment-to-cost-govt-millions/,"Kathmandu, January 2
The government stands to lose millions of rupees with the recent endorsement of the amended public procurement guidelines as contractors delaying a project will not have to pay any compensation.
By revising the procurement guidelines for the record ninth time — fourth time in a span of just seven months — the government has given contractors a leeway to exploit state resources.
In the latest revision, the government has modified the earlier provision that required contractors to pay a penalty of one per cent of the bid amount and return the principal and interest on the amount received as mobilisation fund if they were unable to stick to the construction schedule.
The government gives 10 per cent of the bid amount to the contractor that bags a project as mobilisation fund.
The amended rule states, “No matter what is written elsewhere in the guidelines, the extension of the deadline pursuant to sub-section (6a) will not be taken.”
This means that the latest amendment will cost the state millions of rupees that the errant contractor would otherwise have to pay, while on the other hand, the contractor will be able to get one extension after another if it is unable to complete a project on time.
On August 2, the government had amended the public procurement guidelines for the eighth time after class ‘A’ contractors were found to be forming a syndicate in the bidding process for government tenders. Back then, the government had also included a provision that stated that any contractor that had been charged in corruption cases would not be allowed to participate in any government tender.
Subsequently, the contractors had warned that they would halt all construction activities of ongoing projects too if the government did not withdraw the provisions.
Giving into the threats, the government has revised the provisions so that they are in favour of the contractors.

A joint secretary at the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, seeking anonymity, expressed concerns that the amended procurement guidelines will sharply hike development costs.
Stating that changing the law to suit the contractors will not ensure that development spending will pick up, he said, “The working procedure of overall development activities need to be altered.”
He further informed that the new amendment to the guidelines will greatly harm the state.
Alleging that the oversight mechanisms are not functioning properly in the country, he added, “This points at high level of corruption at the political level.”
Meanwhile, contractors have welcomed the government’s decision on procurement guidelines provision. “Now the construction works will gather momentum,” assured Nicholas Pandey, senior vice president of Federation of Contractors’ Associations of Nepal.

The government is about to hand over the contract to construct a parallel taxiway and expand the international apron at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) to a Chinese contractor. Construction of the taxiway and expansion of the international apron are considered the most difficult tasks among all works related to the upgradation of the TIA.
The Air Transport Capacity Enhancement Project’s office under the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) issued a notice on Wednesday seeking claims and complaints against the contractor company if there are any. CAAN is preparing to ink an agreement worth Rs 6.93 billion for the aforementioned works with the Chinese contractor named China National Aero Technology International Engineering Corporation.
In December 2012, Spanish contractor Sanjose and CAAN had signed a contract for the TIA Modernisation Project, now known as Air Transport Capacity Enhancement Project (ATCEP), with the completion deadline set for March 2016.
But Sanjose had failed to complete the project on time and it was able to achieve only 17 per cent of work in four years. Thereafter, CAAN revoked the Spanish firm’s contract by officially issuing a ‘notice of termination’ on December 9, 2016 for delays in the upgradation work.
Murahari Bhandari, project head of ATCEP, said the project has already been delayed for a lengthy period of time and works related to the upgradation need to be now hastened.

“We will soon ink the agreement with the contractor and construction works will be completed within the new stipulated time, which will be announced after the pact is signed.”
Earlier, the same Chinese contractor company had completed the upgradation of the existing taxiway at TIA five months before the set deadline.
Under the second phase of TIA rehabilitation work, the maintenance of the taxiway had been completed and handed over to CAAN on December 15.
Previously, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was involved in upgrading the airport. But the bank withdrew its support from the project about a year ago. However, CAAN has decided to take up the work of upgrading TIA through its own resources.

The Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP) has decided to issue pending payments of local contractors.
A board meeting of the MWSP that was held here today decided to release outstanding payments of local suppliers owed by the project’s previous contractor Co-operativa Muratori e Cementisti (CMC) di Ravenna.
Local suppliers and vendors have been saying that the previous contractor of the project is yet to clear almost Rs 160 million dues and thus these vendors have been halting the project development time and again seeking clearance of their dues.
The Italian contractor of the project CMC had left the water project in December 2018 just before the project was nearing completion. CMC, which had terminated its contract with the water project citing the company’s bankruptcy, had not issued payments of almost 15 days to workers and also payments worth millions to local vendors.
“The board has decided to issue outstanding dues of workers and local vendors of the water project to ensure timely completion of the project. We will gradually release payments of all workers and vendors,” informed Rajendra Panta, spokesperson for the MWSP board.

The Melamchi Water Supply Project, which remained stalled for more than a year has gained momentum lately with the government awarding a Chinese firm the responsibility to complete the remaining works of the project. On September 29, the government had awarded Chinese contractor Sinohydro the contract to complete the remaining works of the project.
The government has asked Sinohydro to complete the project within October this year.
Though almost 95 per cent of physical works of Melamchi water project has been completed, a few works related to headworks, installing gates, tunnel finishing, diversion tunnel, lining of audit tunnel and finishing touches of the tunnel are pending.
Tiresh Prasad Khatri, executive director of MWSP board, informed that the Chinese contractor has already completed the works of standardisation of access road, construction of cofferdam at project intake area and sedimentation work, among others, and is currently undertaking lining and support work and assembling pipelines inside the tunnel.
In a bid to encourage the contractor to complete the project on time, the government has also announced an incentive for the contractor. Under the scheme, if the contractor is able to complete the project before the deadline, then government will provide it a bonus of Rs 1.27 million per day for each day before the deadline.

A Chinese technical team has initiated a preliminary study of the proposed Tokha-Rasuwagadi road, especially for the tunnel section.
The team has started to conduct a preliminary assessment of the Tokha-Chhahare-Gurjubhanjyang tunnel section and will gradually begin the study of other sections of the road project.
Keshav Kumar Sharma, director general at the Department of Roads (DoR), informed that the team has started its field survey of the area where the tunnel is to be built. “The team is active in the field and is expected to complete the preliminary study within a few months.”
The government had planned to build 4.17-kilometre-long tunnel to connect Tokha with Gurjubhanjyang and a 24-kilometre-long tunnel to connect Betrawati with Rasuwagadi.
However, the Nepali Army is currently working on opening the track of the Betrawati-Rasuwagadi section citing that building a road instead of digging a tunnel would be more cost-effective.
On October 13, Nepal and China had signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a 50-km road linking Kathmandu and Rasuwagadi.
The agreement was signed between the two countries during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
According to the agreement, China may bear majority of the cost of building the road and tunnel, including the cost of all kinds of studies. The team, which is working in Nepal now, will submit its report and government and Chinese authorities will then start the work on the detailed project report (DPR) and detailed engineering study.
However, the funding modality of the project will be discussed only after the DPR is finalised. The government is hoping that the Chinese government will finance the strategic project that the Chinese construction companies have expressed interest to build under the build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) model.
During Xi’s visit, DoR and China International Development Cooperation Agency had signed the agreement.
When the project is completed, it will reduce the distance and travel time between Kathmandu and Rasuwagadi.
The existing Kathmandu-Rasuwagadi road is around 125 km long, and passes through Galchhi of Dhading.
This distance will be reduced to 50 km once this project is executed.

Australia’s S&P ASX 200 gained 0.1% to 6,690.60, while South Korea’s Kospi lost nearly 1.0% to 2,176.67. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 1.1% to 28,496.28, while the Shanghai Composite gained 1.1% to 3,084.26. Tokyo was still closed for the New Year’s holiday.
Regional market sentiment has been on an upswing after President Donald Trump said an initial trade deal with China would be signed later this month. The “Phase 1” trade deal calls for the US to reduce tariffs and China to buy larger quantities of US farm products.

Weighing on the optimism was an announcement earlier in the week from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that his country will soon reveal a new strategic weapon and that North Korea was no longer obligated to maintain a self-imposed suspension on the testing of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles.
But some market observers said Kim’s comments were not specific enough to dampen optimism.
“The clear lack of details on both the threat itself and the timing, over and above the evident desensitized state of the market in previous tests, underpins this lack of reaction,” Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG in Singapore, said.
Adding to the optimism was China’s central bank announcement Wednesday it will cut the amount of money banks will be required to have on hand from Jan. 6 in an effort to boost the slowing economy.
The People’s Bank of China said the reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions would be lowered by 50 basis points, a move that’s expected to release about 800 billion yuan ($114.6 billion) into the economy for lending purposes.
That will boost the economy ahead of the Lunar New Year that falls on Jan. 25. Companies and individuals typically need large amounts of cash on hand during China’s most important annual holiday to pay bonuses, clear debts and cover other expenses.
US trading was closed Wednesday for the New Year’s holiday and opens Thursday.

As the Visit Nepal 2020 tourism campaign officially began from today amid much fanfare, the private sector has said that they will do their best to make the campaign successful.
Citing that Visit Nepal 2020 is an important national event that will help unleash Nepal’s tourism potentials, the private sector has said that they will coordinate with the government and other national and international agencies to make the tourism campaign a ‘remarkable’ one.
“We all know about tourism potentials in Nepal. But they are yet to be fully tapped and the VN 2020 can be a milestone event to unleash such untapped potentials,” said Vinayak Shah, spokesperson for Hotel Association Nepal.
As per him, all tourism stakeholders should contribute to make the campaign a success. Among different packages on offer for foreign tourists, Shah informed that hotels across the country will provide up to 30 per cent discount on food and services throughout the year. “Hoteliers are committed to provide international standard service to tourists,” he added.
Tourism entrepreneur Yogendra Shakya said that the private sector and the government should diversify tourism products in Nepal to attract more tourists. “Just a high number of hotels and quality service is not enough to attract tourists. We should be able to engage tourists in Nepal by offering them multiple packages,” said Shakya, who was also the coordinator of the Visit Nepal 2011 campaign.
Likewise, Shakya also said that the entire country should feel the sense of ownership of the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign to ensure its success.
Similarly, Khum Bahadur Subedi, president of Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN), said that the entire tourism sector is excited with the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign and will join hands with the government to make it successful.
Lauding the government for successfully promoting VN 2020, Subedi opined that this tourism buzz has to be maintained throughout the year.

Those wishing to opt for foreign employment will now be able to search and apply for their preferred job via the website of the Department of Foreign Employment (DoFE).
The department has developed the ‘Attestation Module’ and the ‘Worker Selection Module’ to help foreign job-seekers find the job that suits their preference and qualifications.
Informing about the new website that was launched today, Bhishma Kumar Bhusal, director general of DoFE, said, “We believe that with this website, foreign job-seekers will no longer be forced to seek the help of manpower agents.”
According to him, the website has all the necessary information for foreign job-seekers, including the list of foreign companies that are seeking applicants, where they are based, the cost of service, facilities they will provide, among other details.
“We are gradually shifting towards online system to facilitate job-seekers,” he said.
The department has already implemented foreign employment information management system and started issuing electronic stickers to foreign job aspirants to ensure their safe migration.
As per Bhusal, with this system, the recruitment process will be clean, fair and the middlemen and manpower companies will not be able to cheat the foreign job aspirants. “We will be able to track every process of the foreign job-seeker — from applying for a job to getting the final approval.”
Earlier, the manpower firms used to publish notices for vacancies in foreign companies and the job-seekers were often at their mercy to get selected.
“We implemented the new system to address a large number of complaints regarding migrants’ selection process and break the domination of middleman,” he said, adding, this system will also discourage the tendency of workers to submit the passports and money to the manpower agencies before the final selection.
With the website, the government has also eliminated the need of an agent or middleman in foreign recruitment process.
As per the new arrangement, after receiving the applications, the concerned employer company will prepare a list of selected workers based on the their qualifications, skills, experience and other indicators as prescribed.

Addressing the inauguration ceremony, President Bhandari said the country’s economy was dependent on tourism, which had been affected by the long civil war and unstable political system.
“As we have already overcome political challenges, our major focus now is on economic prosperity. Tourism is the backbone of the country’s economic development,” she said.
Emphasising the immense tourism potential of Nepal, she said, “We can cater to all kinds of tourists as our country has been bestowed with cultural and natural diversity.”

She added that the campaign would play a significant role in conveying that Nepal had more to offer than just Sagarmatha, Pokhara, Chitwan and Lumbini.
She requested all Nepalis — those residing in the country and abroad — to be a part of the campaign and make it successful as Nepali culture equated ‘guest with god (Atithi Devo Bhava)’.
Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai said Nepal was a unique creation of nature and implored all visitors to come for a lifetime experience.
“Nepal is a land of cultural excellence and tourists can visit sacred religious sites and experience our diverse wildlife, flora and fauna,” he said.
Assuring that the country was moving towards the path of good governance and prosperity, the minister also claimed that the government had created a conducive environment for investment.
Stressing that tourism is the main pillar of Nepal’s economic development, he said the target of two million tourists and the campaign itself were inadequate for sustainable development of the sector. “We consider this year as the starting point and plan to follow this path and mark 2020-30 as the tourism decade.”
Tourism ministers from India, China, Myanmar and Jamaica were present during the inauguration and extended their good wishes to Nepal for the grand success of the VN2020 campaign.
The inauguration ceremony of the mega tourism campaign kicked off with chanting of mantras of seven religions — Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Kiratism, Christianity, Jainism, Sikhism — practised in the country. Viber stickers of VN2020 and mascot for the campaign, Yeti, were also released during the inauguration.

Addressing the event, Tourism Minister Bhattarai requested all the stakeholders to come together to achieve the government’s target of increasing the tourism sector’s contribution to the country’s gross domestic product.

As the government is preparing to change policies and acts to create tourism-friendly environment, the sector will be one of the highest revenue and employment generating industry in the coming days, he added.
It has to be noted though that the tourism board currently lacks the top leadership, as its former chief executive Deepak Raj Joshi recently completed his four-year tenure at NTB and that too just ahead of the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign.

Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai has urged the Authorised Workers Trade Union of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) to convince the government with logical reasons for not splitting the organisation rather than threatening to strike against the move.
“If the trade union workers are able to come up with convincing reasons for not separating CAAN, I will halt the submission of the related bill to the Parliament,” the minister said while addressing the 22nd anniversary ceremony of CAAN here today.
He added, however, that if the trade union workers continue to threaten the management with protest, strike and pen down protest, ‘no one will be able to stop the government from presenting the Civil Aviation Bill at the Parliament’.
He also requested the CAAN workers to come up with constructive and productive ideas to operate the organisation smoothly.
“The organisational structure and operational modality need to be changed in tune with the times,” he said.

Emphasising that the country has left behind the culture of protest and embraced the culture of dialogue, he said, “Hence, I urge the trade union leaders to sit for a dialogue to find a feasible solution.”
Demanding the government not to divide CAAN in two different organisations, the CAAN trade union had recently announced that the workers of the authority would stop working if the government did not withdraw its decision.
Meanwhile, Sravan Kumar Yadav, president of the union, alleged that the government was trying to hand over the Nepali aviation sector to the European authorities. He also said that the union would not backtrack from its decision to protest till the government withdraws its decision.
Addressing the event, Kedar Bahadur Adhikari, secretary at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, said that rather than comparing the country’s aviation sector with other countries it would be better to focus on how to improve the sector. “At the moment, our major challenge is to increase the air connectivity of our national flag carrier, for which we all have to work together,” he said, adding, “It is the time to overcome our differences for the greater good of the country.”

The House sub-committee of Public Accounts Committee (PAC) under the Federal Parliament has been unable to finalise its investigation report regarding the outstanding dues accrued by various industrial users of dedicated feeder and trunk line.
On May 10 last year, Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) had forwarded a letter to more than 250 factories that have been availing additional electricity through the trunk line asking them to pay an amount of Rs five billion for the energy consumed by those industries since fiscal year 2016-17. Of the total outstanding amount of around Rs 10 billion up to fiscal 2018-19, the industrialists had paid Rs five billion to power utility.
As the factories refused to pay the remaining Rs five billion, NEA has threatened to slap a penalty on the principal amount — which would further hike the dues of the industrial users.
According to Bharat Kumar Sah, chairman of PAC, the sub-committee is yet to finalise the investigation report. “We have sought written documents from the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation regarding the matter. After the sub-committee receives the document, it will submit its report to the PAC and we will take a final call on the matter.”

On July 21, PAC had constituted a sub-committee on the issues relating to the collection of dues to be raised from such industries for the use of dedicated feeder and trunk line services of NEA. The sub-committee had been assigned to prepare the detailed report on the matter and submit it to the committee along with suggestions within a month. However, it has not done so till date.
Kul Man Ghising, managing director of NEA, informed the power utility is holding discussions with the House sub-committee for a possible way out. “The problem is not as acute as reported and we will follow the suggestions of the committee.”
The sub-committee headed by Minendra Rijal comprises Surya Pathak, Rajan KC, Tejulal Chaudhary, Parbati Bishankhe and Pradeep Yadav as its members.
The sub-committee has held consultations with NEA, industrialists and concerned stakeholders at least three times, but has been unable to come to any conclusion.
NEA, on May 6, had announced that industries being supplied electricity through the dedicated trunk line would be charged an extra 65 per cent fee for the electricity consumed. Immediately after the announcement, industrialists had also declared that they would not pay the additional fees.
While the industrialists had also knocked the doors of high courts in Patan and Butwal, both the high courts had decided in favour of NEA.
Earlier, NEA had decided to ensure dedicated and trunk line facilities (by charging Rs 22 per unit) to large cement industries based in Bhairahawa, Hetauda and Birgunj corridor during the load-shedding hours.

Private telecom company Ncell has started paying its outstanding capital gains tax (CGT) levied by the government on the company’s buyout deal.
Of Rs 22.6 billion pending CGT that the Large Taxpayers’ Office (LTO) has asked Ncell to pay, the company today deposited Rs 4.5 billion at the tax office and has sought permission to pay the remaining outstanding CGT on instalment basis, informed Jhalak Ram Adhikari, chief tax administrator at LTO.

Following the verdict of the Supreme Court (SC), which determined Rs 22.44 billion as the remaining CGT liability of Ncell, the LTO had give the company an ultimatum to pay Rs 22.6 billion (including interest) on December 23.
As the Ncell CGT controversy is also being dealt with by an international tribunal, which recently ordered the government to halt CGT collection from Ncell, the telecom company had been in dilemma about whether or not to pay the tax. However, by depositing Rs 4.5 billion as CGT today, the telecom company has hinted at complying with the SC verdict and the LTO direction.
“Though Ncell has sought the facility of paying the remaining CGT in instalments, we are yet to take any decision on it,” informed Adhikari.
Even as Ncell has started to clear its due CGT, the controversy is far from over as it is still uncertain what impact the order of the international tribunal will have in this case.
Experts have been saying that the interim order issued by the international tribunal is obligatory for countries that are its members, and that the government’s move to collect the outstanding CGT from Ncell amid the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Dispute’s interim order is contradictory.
The interim order was issued on the basis of arbitration proceedings initiated by Axiata Investments (UK) and Ncell against the Nepal government.
Axiata Investments (UK) and Ncell moved the international dispute settlement court in April after LTO asked Ncell to foot the capital gains tax bill of Rs 62.63 billion on Ncell buyout deal.
At that time, Ncell had already paid Rs 23.57 billion to the government, but tax authorities were exerting pressure on the company to settle outstanding tax liability of Rs 39.06 billion immediately.
Thereafter, the company had moved the Supreme Court and the outstanding tax liability was reduced to Rs 22.4 billion.

With the completion of nearly 30 per cent of construction work of India-backed 900-megawatt Arun-III hydroelectric project, the developer company is scheduled to ink the financial closure of the project by February.
Hareram Subedi, residential representative of SJVN Arun-III Power Development Company, informed that the company has almost finalised the necessary documents for the financial closure. “We have already forwarded the necessary documents to Investment Board Nepal (IBN) for its final approval. After we get a goahead, we will ink the financial closure with IBN by February.”
SJVN is a subsidiary company of Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd, India, which has been tasked with building the project.
As per him, IBN has said that they are holding consultations with Nepal Rastra Bank before granting the approval.
“IBN officials have said they will complete the necessary approval work by the end of January and finalise a mutually convenient date for the financial closure.”
Subedi informed that the project has achieved 30 per cent progress in physical work and 11 per cent in financial work till date.
“At present, we are executing the construction work through our equity investment, which is worth Rs 27 billion. After our equity investment crosses at least 50 per cent, we will ink the financial closure with different banks and financial institutions, including two Nepali banks.”
Arun-III is an export-based project, which will bring the largest-ever government-to-government level foreign direct investment (FDI) from India worth $1.2 billion.
He informed that Everest Bank has pledged to invest Rs 10.5 billion and Nabil Bank has committed to invest Rs five billion in the project.
The company has said they have accelerated the civil, hydromechanical and electromechanical works simultaneously.
The company had awarded the aforementioned works to an Indian firm called JP Construction, which has already started executing the construction work. “We plan to start construction of transmission line by the beginning of March, for which the process of awarding the tender has been finalised,” he informed.
Earlier, the government had expressed commitment to facilitate the firm in case it faced any problems related to construction of the project.
IBN and SJVN had inked a pact in November of 2014 for the power development agreement of Arun-III hydropower project. The project was supposed to start generating energy by 2020 as per the earlier agreement.
However, IBN and SJVN reached an agreement later to complete the construction of the project by 2023.
Subedi said that there has been noticeable momentum in major works of the hydropower project, such as construction of headrace tunnel, audit tunnel and powerhouse, among others.
Apart from shares being allocated to the locals and free energy to the affected areas, the government will get Rs 330 billion as royalty in a period of 20 years and the project will also provide 21.9 per cent of the generated energy free of cost.
The project will generate 400 million units of power every year.
As per the agreement with IBN, the developer will hand over the ownership of the project to the government of Nepal after 20 years of commercial operation.

The much-awaited Visit Nepal 2020 campaign will kick off tomorrow with the aim of creating a buzz about the country’s tourism sector across the world.
During a special function to be held at Dasharath Stadium tomorrow, President Bidya Devi Bhandari is scheduled to officially announce the commencement of the mega tourism campaign. The third of its type tourism campaign, being held after 2011, primarily intends to glorify Nepal as a tourism hub, especially among visiting international tourists.
Hundreds of foreign delegates, including tourism ministers from India, China, Myanmar and Jamaica arrived today to participate in the inaugural ceremony. Around 40 media houses from across the world have also sent mediapersons to cover the inaugural ceremony of the national campaign.
To make the VN 2020 campaign successful, the government has introduced new destinations, organised national and international sales missions and appointed brand ambassadors for the event while the private sector has offered discount packages for the year-long campaign.
The event is being supervised by the VN 2020 campaign secretariat under the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation in association with Nepal Tourism Board. Targeting to go beyond the regular products, MoCTCA has introduced 100 new tourist destinations. The ministry had conducted meetings with more than 100 governmental and non-governmental organisations requesting their support to promote this campaign in their respective areas.
Although the VN 2020 promotion has created quite a buzz within the country, the government is yet to put in the required effort to promote the campaign in the international market, said Vinayak Shah, first vice-president of Hotel Association Nepal. “We have enough potential to bring in high-end tourists, but we are still lagging behind in attracting such tourists due to lack of proper tourism infrastructure,” he said. “Moreover, we also have very limited areas where tourists can spend.”
Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai said VN 2020 would be the base year for the next one decade. The government is preparing to announce tourism decade from 2021. “The year 2020 alone is not enough for the development we want in tourism sector,” he said. “Tourism decade will be celebrated to bring about a massive change in the tourism industry.”
He added that the VN 2020 was a public campaign where every single Nepali had to chip in to make it successful.
Amidst this, the government has signed an agreement with the Non-Resident Nepali Association to promote the campaign in foreign countries. In cooperation with NRNA, the government is holding ‘Send one foreign friend to visit Nepal’ campaign. The government has also appointed international celebrities as brand ambassadors of the campaign.
The VN 2020 secretariat announced it would organise several grand events in 2020, including Nepal India China Expo, Mustang Trail Race, Everest Marathon, Otaku Jatra, Sustainable Summits Conference, World Trails Conference, the Great Karnali Quest and Kathmandu Triennale.

The country’s tourism sector made the headlines in the local and international media a number of times in 2019 — unfortunately not for the right reasons every time.

VNY preparations
With the government observing the year 2020 as Visit Nepal Year (VNY), the entire tourism sector in the year 2019 was focused on making necessary preparations for the mega campaign that aims to bring in two million tourists into the country next year.
The preparation for the campaign formally kicked off with the setting up of a campaign secretariat in November of 2018, under the coordination of industrialist Suraj Vaidya.
The Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) also introduced 100 new destinations for the campaign with an aim to lengthen the average stay of tourists. MoCTCA also requested all the ministries, media, local governments, industrialists, tourism associations, celebrities and other stakeholders to help make the campaign successful.
Similarly, the government also signed an agreement with Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) to promote VNY in the respective countries that NRNs are residing in at the moment. ‘Send one foreign friend to visit Nepal’ campaign was also implemented.
The campaign secretariat also decided to establish promotional centres at all Nepali embassies across the world to promote the campaign jointly with NRNA. The logo and banners of VNY 2020 were posted on local buses, subways and rail stations in Canada and the UK. Meanwhile, international celebrities were appointed as ambassadors to promote the campaign in different countries.
The government announced subsidies on expedition royalty for virgin peaks. The forest and environment ministry made preparations to provide free entrance at national parks for trekking and mountaineering enthusiasts. Likewise, Tribhuvan International Airport — the country’s sole international airport — was being upgraded into a boutique airport.
Nepal Tourism Board announced of providing language and skill training to around 2,000 taxi drivers in the valley for the convenience of tourists. Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal (TAAN) too said it would provide hospitality and skill training to 2,000 people involved in travel and trekking industry.
Furthermore, Nepal Airlines Corporation launched late night service at its ticket booking centre located in New Road.
Amidst this, the Nepali Army said it planned to organise year-long event in 2020. Marathon, paragliding, jungle safari, trekking, and multinational joint military Everest expedition will be organised from January to December in different districts.
Offers aplenty
With a target to attract more tourists, the private sector introduced different offers for 2020.
The Hotel Association Nepal will offer a 30 per cent discount on hotel packages. TAAN has introduced three new trekking routes close to Annapurna region and also conducted studies of five new trekking routes outside Kathmandu valley.
The TAAN secretariat also announced special discount packages on the new routes during VNY 2020. Trekking agencies will provide 20 to 30 per cent discount on trekking packages for trekkers booking packages to new destinations.
Meanwhile, TAAN members will also provide 15 per cent discount to both foreign and domestic tourists on regular trekking packages.
Likewise, the Home Stay Association of Nepal will provide 20 per cent discount on their services in 2020. The offer will be available in both community and private homestay services across the country.
Meanwhile, the Nepal Mountaineering Association, in association with the Department of Tourism, has prepared a profile of 414 peaks, including route, itinerary, height of peak, district, area, social condition of the area, and budget details for climbing.
In 2019, the number of five-star rated hotels reached 14 after the DoT provided five-star rating to Kathmandu Marriott Hotel. Likewise, there are eight four-star hotels, while there are a total of 37 three-star hotels in the country. Similarly, there are 43 two-star hotels and 33 one-star hotels currently serving tourists. Altogether now the country has a capacity of 40,856 rooms to accommodate around 2.5 million guests, as per HAN.
Visits of international personalities
The visits of renowned international personalities in 2019 is also expected to play a significant role in 2020. For instance, the visit of Xi Jinping, president of China, and Mohammad Abdul Hamid, president of Bangladesh, in 2019 is expected to attract more number of tourists from China and Bangladesh in the coming days.
Besides, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal organised the 56th Director Generals of Civil Aviation conference in the year, which saw the participation of around 400 foreign guests from 46 countries. Representatives from 14 different international organisations associated with International Civil Aviation Organisation, including European Union, Boeing, Airbus and International Air Transport Association had taken part in the event.
This event was considered as a major platform to promote Nepal and VNY campaign in 2019.
The country also hosted the South Asian Games 2019, where a large number of foreigners visited Nepal. The SAG also raised hopes of establishing Nepal as a sports tourism hub in the future.
Challenges in mountaineering
The year 2019 proved to be a challenging one for the mountaineering sector of the country, primarily as the news of fake rescue scam that was revealed by MoCTCA in 2018 continued to capture the headlines.
The government investigation had revealed that trekking companies in collusion with private hospitals and helicopter operators had been conducting fake rescue operations.
In 2019, the parliamentary committees also carried out independent probes into this issue and directed the ministry to sort it out.
Subsequently, the ministry had implemented ‘Tourist Search, Rescue, Medication and Monitoring Guidelines-2018’.
However, the concerned authorities were found to be largely ignoring the guidelines in the review year.
Mt Everest debacle
The traffic jam in Mount Everest during the spring season captured the attention of everyone in 2019.
According to the Department of Tourism (DoT), it had issued expedition permits to a total of 868 climbers for 30 different peaks. Of them, 381 members from 48 countries had received expedition permits to scale Mt Everest and among them 14 members were from Nepal.
Nine climbers died while scaling Mt Everest from the Nepal side during the spring season, with the congestion largely blamed for the deaths. Hence, DoT came under immense criticism for issuing too many permits for Mt Everest — putting profit ahead of safety of the climbers.
In its defence, DoT claimed the deaths were caused in the Everest due to the climbers suffering from altitude sickness and other health reasons. While it was reported that the department was preparing to ban expeditions on several peaks next year, the DoT had clarified that the rumours were false.
Amidst this, DoT along with other concerned authorities conducted Mt Everest clean-up campaign.
Meanwhile in autumn season, DoT issued expedition permits to a total of 1,210 climbers for 51 peaks in the country. Expeditions to five virgin peaks of above 6,000 metres — Panpoche I, Panpoche II, Hunku Chuli, Hongu and Linku Chuli — were also successfully completed in the autumn season.

Although the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) had announced it would invite tourism ministers from over 30 countries, participation of high-level foreign delegates for the inauguration of Visit Nepal 2020 campaign will not be as envisaged.
Contrary to the ministry’s expectations, tourism ministers from only four countries and high-level representatives from three countries will participate in the inauguration ceremony.
According to the ministry, tourism ministers from India, China, Myanmar and Jamaica will come to Nepal to attend the inauguration ceremony.
Likewise, high-level government representatives from Qatar, Bhutan and Cambodia will be attending the function on January 1.
January 1 is a time for celebrations for people in most countries across the world and since most of them are on holiday during these days the ministry has been unable to welcome more guests from other countries, as per MoCTCA secretariat.
Likewise, around 40 media houses from across the world will be present to cover the inaugural ceremony of VNY 2020 in Kathmandu.

Tourism entrepreneurs and associations related to the sector will also participate in the event. Meanwhile, all the seven provinces will organise a grand inaugural event in their respective provinces on January 1, said Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai at a media briefing today.
Speaking during the press meet, Minister Bhattarai said that the government has spoken to more than 100 governmental and non-governmental organisations, private sector, international organisations, diplomats, social organisations and other related sectors to celebrate this year as a festive year to let the world know Nepal as a vibrant destination for tourism.

32,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/britain-says-will-raise-minimum-wage-by-more-than-6-in-2020/,"
LONDON: Britain’s national minimum wage will rise by more than 6% next year, taking it to 8.74 pounds ($11.49) an hour, the government announced on Tuesday.
The move puts Britain on track to meet its target for the minimum wage to reach 60% of median earnings by 2020, it added.
“Hard work should always pay, but for too long, people haven’t seen the pay rises they deserve,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.

Britain’s unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest since the 1970s and employment recently hit a record high, despite the minimum wage rising by more than a quarter since 2015 to now stand at 8.21 pounds an hour for those aged 25 and over.
The rise to 8.74 pounds is due to take place on April 1.
Minimum pay rates for younger workers will also increase by between 4.6% and 6.5%, depending on their age, the government said. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said: “Raising wage floors by more than double the rate of inflation will pile further pressure on cash flow and eat into training and investment budgets.
“For this policy to be sustainable, government must offset these costs by reducing others – and impose a moratorium on any further upfront costs for business.”
Britain’s minimum wage was introduced under Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair in 1999, and rose relatively modestly following the annual advice of a committee of academics, trade unionists and business representatives.
In 2015, faced with complaints about stagnant living standards, Conservative finance minister George Osborne said he wanted to raise the minimum wage for over-25s to 60% of median earnings by 2020 – implying bigger annual increases.
The Resolution Foundation, an anti-poverty think-tank, said in May that Britain should slow the rate at which it increases its minimum wage to avoid the risk of low-paid workers being priced out of a job during the next recession.
Johnson pledged to raise the minimum wage to 10.50 pounds an hour by 2024 during the run-up to his landslide election victory on December 12.

33,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/about-72pc-of-adbs-portfolio-focuses-on-infrastructure/,"Asian Development Bank, the Manila-based multilateral lender, recently launched its five-year country partnership strategy for Nepal, with focus on development of infrastructure, such as hydroelectric projects, roads and airports, to reduce the cost of production and trade, and attract private investment. The strategy, which will guide ADB’s operations in Nepal from 2020 to 2024, also aspires to provide equitable access to basic services through the federal system of governance and introduce reforms in public financial management of sub-national governments. It also intends to improve Nepal’s resilience to natural hazards, raise the quality of education, provide employment-oriented skills training and commercialise agriculture to raise rural incomes. Rupak D Sharma of The Himalayan Times met ADB’s Country Director for Nepal, Mukhtor Khamudkhanov, to discuss the new five-year strategy, ADB’s operations in Nepal and challenges in project implementation. Excerpts:
ADB recently introduced its Country Partnership Strategy for 2020-24. The latest strategy does not look very different from the previous one, apart from the part on support for sub-national governments. Do you agree?
I don’t agree with that. The current situation in Nepal is very different than in the past, as the country now has a more stable political environment. We can lend support to the government more effectively in this environment. Secondly, the country now has a federal system of government. Our strategy clearly mentions ADB’s operation would focus on adjusting to this new system. That’s why the country partnership strategy has laid down three major objectives. First is to improve infrastructure to support private sector-led growth. ADB used to focus on infrastructure development in the past, but this time we are trying to make sure the infrastructure we build spurs private sector-led growth. Second objective of the strategy is to improve access to devolved services, which is clearly linked to the new federal structure. And third is on environmental sustainability and resilience. This is very critical for Nepal, which is prone to different kinds of natural calamities. So these programmes are different from what we had in the past.
How much is ADB providing annually to the government to meet these objectives? 
Overall, Nepal will receive an average of $500 million to $600 million per year in the five-year period. This means ADB will be investing around $2.5 billion to $3 billion in the next five years.
ADB’s investment portfolio in Nepal stood at $2.8 billion as of June 30. Has Nepal been able to use this financial support to generate outcomes envisaged by the ADB? 
ADB’s investment portfolio in Nepal stood at over $2.9 billion as of October-end. This year we have committed another $358 million for four projects. Of this money, $195 million will be used to improve Mugling-Pokhara highway section; $50 million will be provided to an important programme on food safety and agriculture commercialisation; another $50 million will be used to improve the livelihoods and increase incomes of farmers; and $63 million will be disbursed as additional financing to manage floods and address pollution issues in Bagmati River. So, ADB actually has a big portfolio in Nepal. In 2018, ADB’s commitment to Nepal stood at a record $592 million. This is more than two times the loan we provided per year from 2013 to 2016, when annual average was $235 million. So, there has been substantial increase in lending to Nepal. ADB can increase lending to Nepal but the government must absorb these funds as well. That’s why it is important to increase disbursement because disbursement is proxy for project implementation. An increase in disbursement shows there is progress in project implementation.
Are you happy with the utilisation of funds?
So far, yes. We have good understanding with the government and we are working together. But we always try to encourage government to further improve disbursement because that is important to complete ongoing projects.
You’ve been in Nepal for more than two years. What do you think of Nepal’s development model? 
After years of instability, Nepal now has more stable political environment and a stable government. This has opened a window of opportunity because a stable government helps in speeding up economic development and implementing reforms. Yes, there are challenges ahead, but, in my view, things are on track because the government’s objectives are clear. The main objective of the government is to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth to benefit the people of Nepal. It also intends to improve service delivery and attract more investment, particularly private sector investment, to enhance the quality of life.

You just talked about benefits of having a stable government. But this stability has not been able to remove roadblocks, such as inadequate capacity of the government, slow procurement process, weak performance of contractors and delay in land acquisition, which have been affecting project implementation for long. What is your take on this? 
Yes, there are challenges with regards to staffing capacity of implementing agencies and environmental and social safeguards, such as land acquisition and forest clearance. Nepal needs to take a systemic approach to deal with some of the issues like social safeguards. And ADB is jointly working with the government, particularly in the area of capacity development, to expedite project implementation. We’re now paying more and more attention to project readiness to overcome initial delays that are impacting implementation of many projects. Greater project readiness would also improve disbursements. In 2017, disbursement stood at a historic high of over $275 million. Last year, disbursements fell to around $247 million but that is understandable because that was the first year of implementation of the federal system. This year, we’re actually looking forward to disbursing close to $300 million and break the previous record. As I told you earlier, higher disbursement shows progress in project implementation. One of the examples that I want to share is Gautam Buddha International Airport Project in Bhairahawa, which faced lots of delays in the beginning. But over the last one-and-ahalf years we have been able to achieve really good progress. And by March next year all works are expected to be completed. This would probably be the first national pride project to be completed.
But projects are still facing problems despite high disbursement. For example, Gautam Buddha International Airport faced problems from the contractor and in collection of construction materials like sand and stones. Don’t you think there are problems in project implementation as well?
There are no projects that do not face problems. The important thing is how you work together to overcome them. To avoid initial delays in project implementation, we now require at least 30 per cent project readiness. This means contracts should be ready to be awarded to contractors before projects are forwarded to the ADB’s board for approval. In some cases, we even require more than 30 per cent project readiness. But, of course, you are right that there are certain issues, like forest clearance and supply of aggregates, where systemic approach is required. We raised this issue during the recent tripartite review meeting with the government. It’s not easy to get rid of these problems and I would not say it is easier in some other countries. But it’s important to pay attention to these issues from the beginning to ensure smooth implementation of projects.
Let’s take another example of Melamchi Drinking Water Project. This project, which has been in the making for almost 20 years, has probably taught ADB a lot of lessons on challenges of working in Nepal. Even after all these years and fully being aware of pitfalls, the project has not been completed yet. Is it sheer bad luck or a result of systemic problems?
First of all, we all need to understand that Melamchi is not an easy project. This project has a water supply tunnel of 26 km, which is the longest in South Asia and even in Asia. It is difficult to build a tunnel of that length in mountains, where you do not know whether the rock is hard or soft. Of course, you get some estimates beforehand but they may not be enough. Then the (Italian) contractor that was implementing that project got into difficult financial situation not because of the project itself but because of the situation in its country. This was unfortunate. And it was not expected by anyone, not even by the contractor, I think. So, overall, I think we were able to learn some lessons from that experience. But the good news is that we hope the project to be completed next year. As you know, we have now restructured the procurement plan and hired new contractors. So, we expect things to move forward smoothly now.
Will the project meet the new deadline?
There is not much work left in the tunnel. But the important thing would be to check quality of work performed by previous contractors along the 26km tunnel before water is released. We are also building the second water treatment plant in Sundarijal, which will be completed next year. We have already built first water treatment plant through financial support of the Japan International Cooperation Agency. We also need to check the distribution network for water pressure before commissioning it. So, all these works would take time. But we are working together with the government and the implementing agency and hopefully by the end of next year we will be able to complete this project. I would also like to say that ADB has always been committed to this project despite all the difficulties and we are committed to completing it because we clearly understand how this project is important for the people of Kathmandu valley.
Many say Nepal is too dependent on development partners to build key infrastructure projects, as official development assistance covers over 60 per cent of public capital expenditure. Is this worrying?
Decades of underinvestment, especially in sectors like infrastructure, have affected Nepal. To attain sustainable and inclusive economic growth, Nepal must create enabling legal and regulatory environment. But that may not be enough. If you look at ADB’s portfolio, roughly about 72 per cent focuses on infrastructure, such as transport, energy, urban development and water supply. We also invest in agriculture, education and skills development, which are also critical areas. But going forward, it would be important to bring in private sector investment, both foreign and local, because at a certain stage you cannot rely a lot on development partners. However, private investment will not flow in unless there is proper infrastructure, because investors look for reliable electricity supply to run their manufacturing facilities, good transport network to move inputs and manufacture goods, and proper water supply. These services are not readily available in Nepal.
Lastly, what other infrastructure projects is ADB eyeing in Nepal?
ADB is financing or going to finance few transformative projects such as East-West Highway, which is really important for Nepal. Of the five sections on the 1,000-km highway, four will be financed by ADB. We have already received loan approval for two sections and works have already started on one. Another transformative project we will be supporting is the 630MW Dudhkoshi Hydropower Project, a reservoir-type hydro project. We will also support sectoral reforms. We have launched food safety and agriculture commercialisation project this year. Next year, we will be looking at air transport sector. We will provide $50 million loan to separate regulatory and operational functions of Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal and provide institutional support for air transport sector. We are also implementing reforms in water supply sector and are looking forward to launching a programme to improve access to devolved services by supporting sub-national governments.

Amid uncertainty about completion of Melamchi Drinking Water Supply Project (MDWSP), the executive director of the project has claimed it will be completed by July 15.
Speaking at the Development and Technology Committee under the Federal Parliament today, Tiresh Prasad Khatri, executive director of Melamchi Water Supply Development Board, claimed that the water from Melamchi will be brought to Sundarijal by the end of June.
He said that 95.12 per cent of physical infrastructure of the project has been completed.
Khatri informed that out of 32 gates of the project, two have been installed. “We plan to instal 17 gates by mid-July,” Khatri said, adding that installation of the remaining gates could be carried out without affecting the schedule of launching the project.
On September 29, the government had awarded Chinese contractor named Sinohydro to complete the remaining works of the project by ongoing fiscal.

As per Khatri, the contractor has completed the works of standardisation of access road, construction of cofferdam at project intake area, sedimentation work, among others. “The contractor company is currently undertaking lining and support work and assembling pipelines inside the tunnel.”
Meanwhile, the parliamentary committee has directed the government to release the investigation report on the Melamchi project. It has also directed the concerned authorities to clear the dues of local contractors and vendors that had supplied building materials for the former project contractor.
Meanwhile, Asian Development Bank’s Country Director for Nepal, Mukhtor Khamudkhanov, in an interview with The Himalayan Times, has said he expects the project to be completed ‘by the end of next year’.

35,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/not-much-to-celebrate-for-the-economy-in-2019/,"Kathmandu, December 30
With only a day left before the year ends, a reflection on the past 12 months does not make 2019 a remarkable year for the country’s economy, as development activities failed to gather momentum while growth remained sluggish.
Against the government’s ambitious plan to achieve 8.5 per cent economic growth in fiscal 2019-20, indicators of the economy were not so encouraging though we are nearing the mid-point of the current fiscal year.
While budget implementation remained lethargic, policy implementation continued to be fragile and overall business environment was also not so impressive.
Low capital spending, sluggish development activities
There was not much to celebrate in 2019 when looked at through the economic lens, as per experts.
“Unperturbed by regional economic slowdown, expected annual growth of six per cent is positive. However, there were no major returns and the economy still remains sluggish and tepid,” opined senior economist Swarnim Wagle.
Minister for Finance Yubaraj Khatiwada had defended the slow economic growth in 2018-19 citing that the government throughout the year was focused on developing regulatory framework in line with federalism and the needs of the business community.
He had mentioned that with the completion of formulating necessary laws and policies in 2018- 19, focus would be given to effective budget implementation, development activities and economic growth in 2019-20.
However, the plague of ineffective budget implementation, slow project development and sluggish economic progress remained the same in 2019.
The government was unable to accelerate capital budget spending properly, which directly affects the pace of development activities. As per the statistics of Financial Comptroller General Office (FCGO), development expenditure of the government till today stood at mere 10.24 per cent of Rs 408 billion allocated for the fiscal 2019-20.
Along with this, a number of projects that were expected to be completed within 2019, including the Gautam Buddha International Airport and Melamchi Drinking Water Supply Project, among others, are still a work in progress.
Investor confidence still low
As per the Doing Business Report 2020 of the World Bank, Nepal has leapt to the 94th position out of 190 economies across the world against 110th position that Nepal was placed in the previous year. The report was in line with the government’s claim that business environment has improved in the country in recent years.
However, domestic private sector still refute that the business environment in the country has improved and have not hesitated to state that they have rather been losing confidence gradually owing to various restrictive policies of the government that have provisions of imprisonment even for minor mistakes.
Though formation of a stable government and reliable supply of electricity was a boon for the country, the business community still waits for its expectations to be fulfilled. Citing that the economy is still riddled with twin weaknesses — low private sector confidence and public expenditure — Wagle said that the economy was falsely comforted by the misleading jump in the Doing Business ranking.
Pressure on inflation
Against the government’s plan to keep inflation within five per cent in the ongoing fiscal year, the consumer price inflation stood at 5.76 per cent in mid-November compared to 4.15 per cent during the same period last year. The food and beverages inflation stood at 7.96 per cent with prices of vegetables, fruits, meat and fish surging significantly. Inflation had stood at an almost three-year-high of 6.95 per cent in mid-August due to sharp hike in food prices.
“At present, there is no factor that should lead to sharp price hikes. So, weak governance must be the main reason for it,” said economist Bishwo Poudel, suggesting the government to tighten market monitoring and discourage middlemen from taking undue benefits.
Falling remittance
As Nepal is a remittance driven economy, the constant fall in inflow of remittance is not a good sign for the economy, according to the experts. As per Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) data, remittance inflows decreased by 2.3 per cent to Rs 304.97 billion until mid-November against an increase of 36.4 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.
However, the government is yet to analyse the actual reason behind the decline in remittance inflow.
As Nepal is one of the highest remittance recipients in the world with remittance comprising almost 30 per cent of Nepal’s GDP, experts have urged the government to take effective measures to deal with the issue.
Narrowing trade deficit, sound BoP position
Despite these discouraging factors, the economy did show some hope in the late months of 2019.
Few indicators like narrowing trade deficit and sound Balance of Payments (BoP) position of Nepal is commendable but measures should be taken to sustain them, as per economists.
The country’s total trade deficit narrowed down 8.9 per cent to Rs 414.02 billion in the four months of 2019-20 though such deficit had expanded 37.8 per cent in the same period of the previous year.
As per statistics of NRB, the country’s exports are increasing while imports are decreasing.
In the four months of 2019- 20, merchandise exports increased 23.9 per cent to Rs 36.28 billion compared to an increase of 11 per cent a year ago while merchandise imports decreased 6.9 per cent to Rs 450.3 billion against an increase of 35.8 per cent in the same period of the previous year.
Among others, statistics show that import of petroleum products, gold, aircraft spareparts and cement had been decreasing. Similarly, the BoP remained at a surplus of Rs 27.29 billion till mid-November against a deficit of Rs 57.33 billion in the same period of the previous year.
Economist Keshav Acharya said that though the economy was on the right track from 2017-18, the government had been unable to give continuity to this tempo in recent months. “Though the government has introduced a number policies citing it will improve the business environment in the country, investors are still suspicious over effective implementation of these policies,” he said.
“Moreover, a number of contradictory policies on tax issues and others have discouraged the business community.
Against this backdrop, the economy has not been able to achieve anything significant so far in the ongoing fiscal,” said Acharya.

The Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, has urged the Ministry of Home Affairs to take action against sugar mill operators who have not cleared payments of cane farmers since long.
The MoICS urged MoHA to take action against sugar mill operators who were not only delaying payments to sugarcane farmers but were also reluctant to come in contact with farmers and the government. “A letter has been sent to MoHA to do the needful, as a few sugar mill operators had been intentionally delaying payments to cane farmers since long and were not meeting them,” Hari Bahadur KC, spokesperson for MoALD, told THT.
Cane farmers from across the country have gathered in the capital and have been staging protests against the delayed payment of outstanding dues. They have been organising protests in Maitighar for the past couple of days, alleging that sugar mills had not cleared Rs 1.5 billion they owed to farmers. They approached the Industry, Commerce, Labour and Consumer Interest Committee of the Parliament today, urging it to facilitate the process of getting their dues cleared.
“As the crushing of new sugarcanes will begin soon, farmers are not in a position to start harvesting their produce until sugar mills clear the pending dues. Some sugar mill operators have not cleared millions of rupees they owe to farmers and are refusing to meet them,” said Kapil Muni Mainali, president of Nepal Sugarcane Producers Federation.
Addressing a meeting of the parliamentary committee today, Minister of Agriculture and Livestock Development Ghanashyam Bhusal acknowledged that sugar mills were not clearing payment to cane farmers on time and some sugar mill operators were not even in contact with the government. Annapurna Sugar Mill and Maha Laxmi Sugar Mill have not cleared Rs 500 million and Rs 210 million, respectively, he added.
Meanwhile, Kedarnath Sharma, spokesperson for MoHA, said the trend of ministries not accomplishing their duties and leaving everything to the home ministry was unfortunate.
“We have received the letter from MoICS and will address their concerns. However, it is first the responsibility of MoALD and MoICS to ensure that farmers get payment on time,” he said.
Earlier today, the House committee meeting had also directed the government to make sure that cane farmers received payments for their produce from sugar mills on time. The committee has asked the government to not only make sugar mills clear outstanding dues of sugarcane farmers but also take action against the sugar factories and owners delaying the payments.

A Nepali migrant worker named Indra Prasad Bhattarai, 47, from Taplejung district was killed in Malaysia today after he fell into a meat-mincing machine in Malacca state, an official confirmed.
Bhishma Kumar Bhusal, director general of the Department of Foreign Employment, has confirmed that Bhattarai was killed while working in Malaysia. “We are coordinating with our Embassy in Malaysia to bring the body back.”
According to AFP, Bhattarai was working in a meat-processing factory, FB Food Industry, near Masjid Tanah in Malaysia when the incident occurred. “The victim was doing maintenance work with three other workers when suddenly the machine was turned on,” the AFP quoted a local authority as saying.
“The machine caught him at his waist. Because of his injuries, he died on the spot,” the local authority was quoted by AFP.
Moti Bahadur Shrees, deputy chief of mission at the Embassy of Nepal in Kuala Lumpur, said they were waiting for the post-mortem report from the local hospital. “After we receive the post-mortem report, we will begin the process of sending his body to Nepal as soon as possible.”
“We are in continuous contact with the Malaysian authorities concerned,” said Shrees, adding that as per the document presented by the deceased earlier at the embassy, he had reached Malaysia in 2016 on his own.
The Malaysian authority has said it took about 30 minutes to extricate Bhattarai’s body from the machine and that officials were still investigating the matter.
As per the data maintained by the Malaysian government, there are around 360,000 Nepali workers in Malaysia, with most of them doing security, construction and hospitality jobs.
According to the Foreign Employment Board under the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, 821 Nepali migrant workers lost their lives in various labour destinations in the last fiscal year. Among them, 289 migrant workers were killed in Malaysia.
According to the board, 251 Nepali migrant workers have been killed in the first four months of the ongoing fiscal.
Malaysia hosts nearly two million registered foreign workers, who flock to the Southeast Asian nation in search of better work prospects and higher pay than in their native countries.

The programme was organised on August 16 and 17 at Kanjirowa National Secondary School in collaboration with Robotics Association of Nepal (RAN) and Nepal Robotics Project, USA, according to a press release issued by the organiser.

The main aim of the training was to promote STEM — focusing on both the practical and theoretical aspects of robotics in Nepal, reads the statement. As many as 28 participants from 18 schools were involved in learning about the fundamentals of STEM education, drone making, aerodynamics, principles of flying, among others.
Kapil Dev Regmi, Chairman of Kanjirowa School, highlighted that Nepal’s education system required a practical approach to encourage the students for innovation and research rather than promoting rote learning. He was hopeful that such training will be given priority in more schools in future.
Participating teachers had an opportunity to interact with one another and share their experiences on the condition of STEM education in Nepal. The programme was led by some innovative engineers having extensive knowledge of robotics and latest technological advancements in the field.
Michael Kronmiller from Nepal Robotics Project, US, Aliyah Pandoliff from Kashmir World Foundation, US, and Prof Sandra Magnus, former NASA Scientist and Astronaut sent messages for the success of the programme and expressed their interests to work further with Kanjirowa in STEM education in the future too.

Nepali students, who wish to pursue non-academic courses, like vocational education or language courses in countries such as Australia and Japan, will not be allowed to do so from now onwards, thanks to the government’s radical move aimed at curtailing the rights of high school graduates to make choices. What’s more, students who have not completed Grade XII will not be allowed to study abroad.
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology published a notice today stating that students who have completed Grade XII or equivalent will be given ‘no objection letters’ to study abroad only if they intend to pursue academic courses of bachelor’s level or above.
Students cannot study abroad without obtaining ‘no objection letters’. These letters are also essential to get foreign currency exchange facility.

“We will issue no objection letters even to those who wish to pursue technical and vocational education, language courses and academic bridge courses, which are similar to language courses. But those students will have to provide evidence to substantiate they will get enrolled in a university to pursue academic courses after completing vocational or language courses,” said MoEST Under-secretary Maheshwor Sharma.
This move will largely affect students intending to study in Australia. Many Australia-bound Nepali students join technical and vocational institutions. This is common among those pursuing nursing.
Technical and vocational education, which is a non-academic course, generally prepares students for the job market, as it is designed by conducting studies on the needs of several industries. Countries such as Australia, Germany and Switzerland are well known for their technical and vocational education courses.
The latest move will also hit students who leave for Japan to pursue language courses. Many of them have not even passed Grade XII.
The latest provision introduced by the government clearly states that students will not be given permission to study abroad if they have not completed Grade XII. At present, not many students prefer to study abroad before passing Grade XII, but the new provision prevents parents who can afford to, or students who wish to, from doing so.
“The new provisions were introduced on the basis of the law which states that students can only get enrolled in foreign institutions if they intend to pursue higher education,” said Sharma. He added, “We now define higher education as tertiary education and not education attained in Grade XI and XII.” Earlier, the government used to define education provided in grades XI and XII as higher education. This has changed after the government started recognising grades XI and XII as a part of high school.
“The government should not have introduced such a provision without holding consultation with stakeholders. This blanket provision will not do good to students planning to study abroad. Students should be allowed to go abroad if they can attain quality education,” said Kedar Bhakta Mathema, former vice-chancellor of Tribhuvan University.

Loughlin, who starred in the television sitcom “Full House,” and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli filed papers in federal court in Boston waiving their personal appearances at an arraignment hearing and asking to have not guilty pleas entered on their behalf.
They are among 50 people accused of participating in a massive scheme that allowed wealthy parents to use cheating and $25 million in bribes to help their children secure spots at well-known universities like Yale, Georgetown and USC.
California college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer pleaded guilty in March to charges that helped parents facilitate cheating on college entrance exams and bribed coaches at universities to falsely present their children as athletic recruits.
Prosecutors allege that Loughlin (54) and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USC’s crew team, even though they did not row competitively, to help them gain admission.
Loughlin and Giannulli provided Singer photographs of their daughters in order to create fake athletic profiles for them, which a USC athletics official in exchange for bribes then used to support recruiting them, prosecutors said.
The couple and several other parents were originally charged in March with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Prosecutors secured an indictment on April 9 that included an additional charge of conspiring to commit money laundering.
Several other parents charged alongside Loughlin and Giannulli also filed papers seeking to waive appearing at an arraignment and have not guilty pleas entered for them. A federal magistrate judge granted their requests on Monday.
In all, 33 parents have been charged in the college admissions scandal. Of those, 13 have agreed to plead guilty, including “Desperate Housewives” TV star Felicity Huffman. She is scheduled to plead guilty on May 21.

ULYSSES, KANSAS: A 16-year-old Kansas boy will soon earn his high school diploma — and a few days later he’ll travel to Harvard to collect his bachelor’s degree.
Ulysses High School senior Braxton Moral will attend both commencement ceremonies in May, becoming the only student to successfully pursue a four-year high school degree and a bachelor’s degree from Harvard at the same time, The Hutchinson News reported .
Harvard has changed the rules, Braxton’s father Carlos Moral said, so his son will “the one and only” reaching that milestone. Braxton Moral will be 17 when he gets his diplomas.
Carlos Moral said they began to realize their son was special when he was in the third grade.
“They told us: ‘You need to do something. He’s not just gifted. He’s really, really gifted,’” he said.
Braxton Moral skipped the fourth grade.
The Ulysses school district allowed him to take some high school classes while he was still in middle school. Before high school he took a class offered at Fort Hays State University. Then he was admitted into Harvard.
Braxton Moral simultaneously studied at the high school and the Harvard Extension School. The program typically serves adults who work and can’t attend classes on campus full time.
Ulysses High School math teacher Patsy Love served as the proctor for the Harvard program, administering Moral’s tests in Kansas. Moral spent the summer before his junior year at Harvard’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
“We constantly are monitoring Braxton to make sure he is not too overwhelmed,” said Julie Moral, Braxton Moral’s mother. “No achievement is worth him being unhappy.”
Braxton Moral is on track to graduate from the Bachelor of Liberal Arts program, with a major government and a minor in English, said Harry Pierre, associate director of communications for Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education.
Braxton Moral said he hopes to attend Harvard Law School next.
“Politics is end game for me,” he said, though he’s still too young to vote.

KATHMANDU: Mahendra Morang Adarsha Multiple Campus in Biratnagar is to provide re-totalling and college migration forms to students inside college premises.
The college agreed to provide the forms after a student lodged a complaint at ‘Hello Sarkaar’ section of the Prime Minister’s Office in Kathmandu, arguing that as the college did not provide re-totalling and migration forms, students were compelled to buy these from stationery where the owners denied them VAT bill.
The complaint was forwarded to Tribhuvan University with priority. It was later forwarded to the TU Office of the Controller of Examinations by Information and Public Relations Division of the University.
Consequently, all colleges in the eastern region of the country have been directed to ensure availability of the forms inside college premises. Joint Controller of Examinations, Arjun Bikram Khadka, shared this information.

KATHMANDU: First-of-its-kind internship and job placement fair has been organised in the capital by an engineering college, targeting fresh graduates.
Sagarmatha Engineering College (SEC) and its sister concern Sagarmatha College of Science And Technology, in collaboration with Zobfindr, organised the ‘Internship and Placement Fair’ with the theme ‘Sagarmatha – Institution to Industry’ in its college premises in Sanepa, Lalitpur, on November 17.
The event was organised targeting fresh graduates and eighth-semester students of IT and Engineering for internship and job placement.
Students of BE Civil, BE Computer, BE Electronics and Communication, and BSc CSIT from various colleges across the country received an opportunity of an on-the-spot interview for internship and job at a single venue. On-the-spot interview with top IT and engineering companies of Nepal was the main highlight of the event.
Dakshina Shrestha, Associate Professor and Head of Training and Placement Unit said, “The event was organised with an objective of helping students liaise with the industry and job market to make a smooth transition from college to corporate life. Many graduates were placed by online interviews. Overall, it was a win-win situation for both companies and graduates. The feedback we received was excellent. We were requested to organise such event every year.”
Sixteen of the leading Nepali companies working in the field of information technology and engineering like Javra Software, Leapfrog, Vianet, Karkhana, Fuse Machine, Wikimedians Nepal, among others had participated in the event.
One of the representatives from Javra Software, Technical Manager Dev Narayan said, “When I came here I expected a huge crowd, and students seeking jobs. That is what happened. I feel this is a good initiative taken by the college. I feel, definitely, a lot of engineers will be selected through the event.”
The event witnessed a participation of around 700 students.
Organisations working in related field like Malaya Foundation, Virinchi College, Himalayan College of Management, Sudreeshya Academy, Halftone Designs, Broadway, Start Technology, Sukrabar, and Way 360 had sponsored this open event.

BOSTON: The latest crop of US Rhodes scholars has more women than any other single class, and almost half of this year’s recipients of the prestigious scholarship to Oxford University in England are either immigrants or first-generation Americans, the Rhodes Trust announced Sunday.
Among the 32 winners is Harvard University senior Jin Park, the first recipient covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation.
Park, 22, of the New York City borough of Queens, arrived from South Korea with his parents when he was 7, studied molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, and founded a nonprofit to help undocumented students apply to college.
He hopes to become an immigrant advocate, saying it’s important for him to use the opportunity to better others, not just himself.
“When you grow up as an undocumented immigrant in America, that understanding that your talents don’t really belong to you in the traditional sense, that you have to share the fruits of your labor with others, that’s just something you learn,” Park said.
Alaleh Azhir, a 21-year old senior at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, emigrated from Iran when she was 14 — and is also one of 21 female scholars named Sunday. The New York City resident hopes eventually to become a doctor and will study women’s and reproductive health at Oxford.
“I’m just a passionate advocate for women in general and that’s mostly because of my background,” she said. “I thought that the way I could advocate for women could be by advocating for their health.”
At Chapman University in Southern California, Vidal Arroyo, 21, reflected on his unlikely path to becoming his school’s first Rhodes Scholar.
“As a Latino, a first-generation college student, and a train commuter to college, winning this scholarship means so much to me because it sheds hope for students from backgrounds like my own who have to overcome multiple barriers in pursuit of a higher education and a better future,” said Arroyo, who plans to study engineering science at Oxford.
And Eren Orbey, a 23-year-old senior at Yale University in Connecticut, whose parents emigrated from Turkey, hopes studying at Oxford will bring greater “context and clarity” to his writing. He is a regular contributor to The New Yorker magazine and is working on a book about his father, who was slain in Ankara when he was just 3, and the killer.
“I’m interested in studying the ethics of revenge and forgiveness,” Orbey said Sunday by email. “I think that our culture and media coverage often condescend to immigrants and survivors of trauma. In my writing, I hope to recast tragedy and strife as occasions for growth and heroism.”
The US Rhodes scholars join a separate, international group of scholars representing more than 60 countries.
Rhodes Scholarships provide all expenses for at least two years of study at Oxford. They were created in 1902 in the will of Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman and Oxford alum who was a prime minister of the Cape Colony in present-day South Africa.

LONDON: Football legend David Beckham has visited Indonesia – where one in three children have been physically attacked in school – to see how his charity, the 7 Fund, is combating bullying.
The A-list celebrity and former England captain launched the fund to protect the world’s most vulnerable youngsters in 2015 with the United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF).
“I feel very proud to see how my 7 Fund is helping UNICEF tackle bullying and violence in schools in Indonesia, and is ultimately keeping children, especially girls, safe in their schools so they can continue their education,” he said.
Bullying and violence are among the biggest worries for young people in Indonesia, with more than 1 in 5 teens aged 13 to 15 – or 18 million students – experiencing it, leading to mental health problems and school dropouts, UNICEF said.
The 7 Fund teaches children who have been bullied and former bullies to educate others and trains teachers to keep children safe. Bullying has been reduced by almost a third among the 7,000 children who have taken part in pilot programmes, it said.
“I spent time with an amazing young girl – Sripun – who was voted by her peers to take part in an anti-bullying programme to help stop violence in schools,” Beckham said in a statement.
“This has increased her confidence and she’s hopeful that other students won’t have to go through the same bullying experience she did.”
The fund — named after Beckham’s lucky number on his England and Manchester United shirts — focuses on children at risk of violence, abuse or disease.
Beckham, a father of four, has said that he hopes his own children will be proud of his work with the 7 Fund, which also has projects in Indonesia, Nepal, Uganda and El Salvador.

Similarly, former education minister Dhaniram Paudel said despite the handover of the education system to the local levels, the Ministry of Education, Department of Education and district education offices should handle the education system.
Madhu Prasad Regmi, secretary at the Ministry of Education, said 23 responsibilities of the education sector had been given to the local levels without hampering the educational system.
As all the basic and secondary schools are being handled by the local levels it will be easy to manage resources for the education sector from local resources, he added.

Kathmandu
Teachers are guides for students providing students with valuable knowledge, which help students to excel in their studies as well as life in general. Teachers with decades of teaching experience in various colleges share important tips.

Study on a regular basis
Teachers suggest that students should give regular time to their studies. However, they say there is no fixed hours that they should set aside.
“Regular reading is a must,” says Bharat Kumar Bhattarai, who has 30 years of experience as a Nepali lecturer. He suggests students to prepare notes right from the beginning of the academic year and go through it regularly.
Saroj Pyakurel, Accounting lecturer in different colleges in Kathmandu, says that there is no fixed hours that students should give to their studies. However, according to Pya-kurel, who has 14 years of teaching experience, students should give as much time as they can daily, in which they would be able to understand the lessons taught every day. “Students themselves should decide how much time they should give regularly on a daily basis so they understand the lessons,” he suggests. He stresses that during holidays too, students should set aside at least three hours for revisions.
Educationist Prof Dr Bidya Nath Koirala says that the time students should give to their studies depends upon their nature. Some students learn fast and some slowly, so students themselves should find out how much time they should give to their studies according to their learning ability.

Tips for exam preparation
Educators suggest that students should go through all the topics of a subject in order to obtain good marks in exams.  Nepali lecturer Bhattarai suggests students to divide time according to the importance and marks of the topics. “For the exams you should not study selecting a few topics, but study all the topics in the text with the intention to understand each topic thoroughly.”
He says that students who select only few a topics to study for exams will not be able to do well. “Every topic in course is inter-related, and if students do not understand earlier topics, they will not be clear about the next chapter too,” he opines.
He also suggests students to prepare for exams by noting down important points of each chapter. Besides this, he says that students, who prepare notes from the beginning, will score good marks in exams as they will have already gained a deep knowledge of each chapter. However, he suggests avoiding using guides books and guess papers. “Students depending upon guide books and guess papers will ruin themselves,” he informs as “guide book writers are not responsible ones; they take it as a job and they are not responsible towards students’ progress.”

Be proactive
Students should not only depend upon the teachers’ notes but should also work on their own by studying reference materials, books from the library and doing online researches, as per the teachers.
“Teachers are limited within the circle of their knowledge and education, so students should also study and prepare from books by various writers. This will broaden their knowledge,” says Bhattarai.
Pyakurel also argues that students should not only depend upon their teachers and course books. “Students can benefit much from YouTube and Google as thousands of study materials are available there.”
He further says, “The mind is always motivated by desire, so students should also research on issues in which their interests lie.”

Questioning mind
Prof Dr Koirala says that raising questions is the most important feature of a learner. He says that students should always have questions in their mind and ask questions to themselves in order to learn. On any topic or issue, a student should ask questions: Why it is so? How did it happen? What is the mechanism behind it? How is it related with me? Raising such questions will make a student understand topics analytically, he says.

Clear vision
Sociology lecturer Uttam Prasad Devkota says that students should have a goal. Devkota has 13 years of experience in teaching.  “It is not that you study BBA because you completed your plus two level. Students should have a clear vision about their field of interest and about what they want to be in future,” points out Devkota. He adds that the students should not be limited to their course but should broaden their horizon by gaining knowledge on social, cultural, political and economic conditions of the country and people. Students should always notice what is happening in their society and country. This will make them explore the possibility of the current subject they are studying. They should not only prepare to get good results in exams but think of study and learning as a regular process, Devkota adds.

Kathmandu
Teej, one of the greatest festivals for Hindu women, is here. Students also celebrate this festival, and even if they don’t, they are affected by the festivities surrounding it as people from their friend circle or family members celebrate it. Sharing their views about this festival, they admit that the study environment college and homes is affected by the festival.
In celebratory mood
For most students the best aspect of this festival is that it strengthens the bond between female members in society as they meet and share their feelings with each other. They add that the singing, dancing and the celebration part of the festival is what they enjoy the most.
Nisha Khatiwada, a resident of Kapan and a Vth semester student of Bachelor of Public Health at the Karnali College of Health Sciences in Battisputali, says that it is fascinating to see women in red, dancing and singing folk songs on streets, going to temples in a holy and fasting mood.
Class environment
Rebecca Maghariya, a IVth year student of Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) at the Shanker Dev Campus in Putalisadak, says that as their college has no uniform, students come wearing red and green, or colourful kurta and also with mehendi on their hands two weeks prior to Teej. Maghariya is from Kailali and is currently residing in Thankot.
Maghariya’s classmate Pratiksha Gautam says Teej becomes a subject of all talks among classmates. Gautam hails from Rukum and is residing in Dillibazar. According to her, kind of clothes to wear and songs to sing during Teej become the main topics of talk in class starting a few weeks before the festival.
Effects on study
The students also admit they are distracted from their studies during the festival due to many reasons.
Neeru Poudel, a IVth Year BBS student at Shanker Dev Campus, says that the festival affected her when she was studying in BBS Ist Year as the board exam was on the same day. She was distracted from her studies as there was a celebratory environment at her home. According to her, this year too the BBS Ist Year board exams were scheduled on Teej but was postponed due to floods in Tarai. Poudel is from Syangja and residing in New Baneshwor. She says that music and other noise from Darr events at a nearby complex could be heard from her room. This disturbs her while doing her college assignments.
Umesh Bhakt Joshi, a IInd Year student of Bachelor of Law (LLB) at the Nepal Law Campus at Pradarshanimarg, says that around 50 per cent of female classmates in his class do not attend class from around two weeks prior to Teej. Joshi, from Bajhang and residing in Kirtipur, says almost all his female classmates are absent from Darr eating day till Rishi Panchami. He opines that as half the number of students remain absent, their lecturers show no interest in teaching and usually postpone classes for a week. There is also less possibility of female lecturers holding classes on those days, informs Joshi, adding that student unions in the college have organised Darr programme for students this year too as in previous years.
Shanta Bahadur Tamang of the Nepal Law Campus however, says that Teej celebration should not affect students regarding their studies as it depends upon students themselves on how to manage time. According to him, if some days are to be spent in celebrations, students should study those chapters early on or give extra time to the same after the festival ends.
Superstition
Apart from these aspects of Teej, Khatiwada said she does not believe bathing and performing other rituals on Rishi Panchami will purify women and earn them penance from the so-called mistakes they may have committed being and making others impure during periods. Such superstitions push women to an inferior position in society, she adds.

67,https://thehimalayantimes.com/education/the-hostel-life/,"Hasana Lawaju talks to college students who are living in hostels as they pursue their studies and finds out why students find it advantageous to stay in one


Hostel provides a good environment for studies — serious students take the best advantage while living in hostels. While there are the fun and challenges of living in a hostel, these are also the best places for students to live while pursuing their higher studies. Most students agree that they are motivated to study while saving their time as they attend their colleges while living in hostel.
Conducive study environment
Some students find hostel environment motivational to concentrate in their studies, especially during exams.  “Every student staying in a hostel usually has exams at the same time, and thus all are studying during that time,” says Bishwadeep Tamang, a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering, Bhaktapur. Tamang, who hails from Sankhuwasabha, is staying at Hostel Libali — a private hostel in Bhaktapur.
Tamang’s classmate as well as roommate Manish Dhakal echoes a similar view — “when a  friend is studying for exams at hostel, a competitive spirit develops among other friends, and as a result everyone is motivated to study”.
The motivation to study comes from seniors at her hostel for Manisha Khadka, Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) VIth Semester student.  Khadka, who studies at Padmakanya Multiple Campus, Baghbazar and stays in the college’s Pragya Chhatrawas, shares, “When I see my seniors — especially Master’s level students — studying sincerely, I am inspired to study properly.”
Living in a hostel with classmates becomes advantageous, especially when one misses a class or does not understand the topic taught in the classroom.  “Whenever I do not understand any topic taught by the teachers, I can consult my roommates or other friends in the hostel who have a better understanding of the topic,” points out Kshitij Dahal, BE (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering. Dahal also resides in Hostel Libali.
However, Sharmila Upadhyaya staying at Padma Girls Hostel in Pulchowk, has a different experience. Initially, when she started living in the hostel three-and-a-half years ago, it was difficult for her to adjust because she was not used to studying in group. But with time, she has gotten used to it.
Upadhyaya, BE (Computer Engineering) VIIIth Semester student at the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk,  shares her hostel offers a good environment for students as it “only selects students after checking their academic performances”.
Life made easier
Khadka’s hostel is next to her college premises. “It takes me only a few minutes to reach my hostel. So, my time is not wasted in travelling,” says Khadka, who hails from Butwal. Living near the college, she claims to utilise most of her time for studies.
Had Dhakal, whose house is in Kapan, chosen to commute to his college in Bhaktapur from his home “I would have spent at least four hours daily just travelling in bus”. Thanks to his decision to stay in a hostel, he is able to save valuable time.
The students also need not cook or do laundry and cleaning as most hostels provide students with food, laundry and other services.

“We do not need to cook, wash dishes or clothes, and it is convenient for us,” Tamang shares.
Along with that other facilities are available in the hostels. For instance, the three-and-a- half storey Pragya Chhatrawas has made one study hall available in each floor for students along with Wi-Fi facility, as per Geeta Tandukar, a third class officer at General Administration Division of the Padmakanya Multiple Campus.
Kutumba Boys Hostel, Jawalakhel receives students’ report cards from their respective colleges. “We wake the students up early in the morning, monitor their studies, talk to the parents if their children are not concentrating in their studies or have poor academic performances,” hostel coordinator Bandana Khatri reveals.
More than studies
Be it a hostel run by the college or a private one, most make students’ academics the priority. But they also provide opportunities for students to have fun. As such, the occasional celebrations in hostels are the best moments for students like Khadka. They celebrate Teachers’ Day where they offer treats to their teachers and also celebrate birthday of their hostel warden, as per Khadka.
Hostel wardens too support the students in such endeavours. Rakesh Machamasi, Warden of Hostel Libali informs, “We prepare delicacies like Dahi Chiura, Khir, Yomari et cetera  on different occasions for the hostel students and we all celebrate together. Our students find such celebrations interesting.”
Dissatisfaction 
Most students agree that hostels provide them with a good study environment. However, they have some dissatisfaction too, mostly about the food served.
“Sometimes, the food served by our hostel is not hygienic. At times I have found insects and hair in the food, though it does happen always,” complains Khadka.
Dahal has some objection with the meat-policy of his hostel. “Our hostel serves meat every Wednesday. But if I do not feel like eating on that day and want to have meat on some other day, that is not possible,” Dahal argues.
But Upadhyaya puts forth a different opinion. “It is not what we want to eat, but what is available. If we do not eat properly, no one in the hostel will convince us to eat. As such habits like not eating on time  can even affect our health. So, rather than complaining, we should learn to take care ourselves,” she opines.

The actress and her musician husband, Benji Madden, on Friday announced the birth of a daughter they’ve named Raddix.
“We are so happy, blessed and grateful to begin this new decade by announcing the birth of our daughter,” Diaz wrote on Instagram. “She has instantly captured our hearts and completed our family.”
But don’t expect a photo of the baby. Diaz wrote that while she and Madden “are overjoyed to share this news” they “also feel a strong instinct to protect our little one’s privacy.” The Instagram post had no image attached.
“We won’t be posting pictures or sharing any more details, other than the fact that she is really really cute! Some would even say RAD,” Diaz wrote.
Diaz, whose films include “There’s Something About Mary” and “Bad Teacher,” married Madden, a member of the band Good Charlotte, in early 2015.
Both parents posted the identical message on Instagram. Representatives for both stars did not immediately respond to calls for comment.

69,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/study-finds-2019-was-a-banner-year-for-female-filmmakers/,"NEW YORK: Lulu Wang, Lorene Scafaria, Melina Matsoukas and Greta Gerwig led Hollywood to a record year for women in the director’s chair. In 2019, women directed more of the most popular movies than any year before.
Women directed 12 of 2019’s top 100-grossing films in 2019, according to a study released Thursday by USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. That percentage of female filmmakers, 10.6%, is greater than researchers have recorded before, suggesting that some measure of change is finally coming to a film industry where inequality behind the camera has remained stubbornly persistent.

It’s the most meaningful increase in several decades for female directors. Despite mounting outcry, the rate of female directors helming Hollywood’s top productions has long been largely stagnant. The previous high in USC’s annual study was 8%, in 2008. In 2018, only 4.5% of the year’s top films were directed by women.
“This is the first time we have seen a shift in hiring practices for female film directors in 13 years,” said Stacy L. Smith, one of the study’s authors. “One notable reason for this jump in 2019 was that Universal Pictures had five films with women directors at the helm in the top 100 movies. Yet there is still much more progress needed to reach parity for women behind the camera.”
The high-profile success of several films had already made 2019 a historic one for women. Those include Wang’s “The Farewell,” one of the year’s most popular indie releases, Scafaria’s acclaimed “Hustlers” ($105 million domestically), Matsoukas’ “Queen & Slim” ($40.7 million) and Gerwig’s “Little Women,” which last week opened strongly with $29 million in its first five days of release.
“Frozen II,” with $1.2 billion in worldwide ticket sales, is close to setting a new box-office record for a movie directed by a woman. Jennifer Lee, who co-directed the film, set the record with the first “Frozen” film. In 2018, Lee became the chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios.
Other notable films included Kasi Lemmons’ “Harriet,” Tina Gordon’s “Little” and Jill Culton’s “Abominable.”
USC researchers singled out Universal Pictures, which put forward a slate of films with 26% directed by women. Universal is the only major studio with a female studio chief, Donna Langley.
Netflix also fared well. While the streaming company’s films largely bypass theaters — leaving them outside the study’s parameters — 20% of Netflix’s 2019 movies were directed by women.
Paramount Pictures, however, hasn’t released a movie directed by a woman in the last five years.
Four women of color directed one of the top 100 movies in 2019, though the overall statistics for underrepresented directors dipped. Underrepresented filmmakers were behind 16.8% of films in 2019, a decline from last year’s 21.4%, a record.
“While 2019 is a banner year for women, we will not be able to say there is true change until all women have access and opportunity to work at this level,” said Smith.
Another study released Thursday by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University examined women in the top films as not just directors but writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers. Women accounted for 20% of all such roles in the year’s top films, up from 16% the year before.
But the San Diego State University study, the 22nd annual Celluloid Ceiling authored by Martha Lauzen, found less progress when the movies researched were expanded to the top 500 films. In that metric, Lauzen found women held steady at 23%.
“While the numbers moved in a positive direction this year, men continue to outnumber women 4 to 1 in key behind-the-scenes roles,” Lauzen said in a statement. “It’s odd to talk about reaching historic highs when women remain so far from parity.”
Despite gains, female filmmakers have been largely overlooked in this awards season. Sunday’s Golden Globes, presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, includes no women nominated for best director. None of the 10 films nominated for best picture were directed by women, either.
Rebecca Goldman, Time’s Up chief operating officer, earlier said those results were unacceptable.
“This year, there have been twice as many women-led features than ever, with more films by female directors on the way,” Goldman said. “Women — and especially women of color — continue to be pushed to the sidelines by a system that holds women back, onscreen and off.”

Justin Bieber is launching a docu-series about creating his new album on YouTube, the platform where the singer originally got his start in music over a decade ago.
YouTube announced Tuesday that “Justin Bieber: Seasons” will debut Jan. 27. The 10-episode series will follow the pop star while he records his first new album since 2015. Before releasing his debut song in 2009, Bieber gained popularity from posting his performances of cover songs on YouTube.
“When I was getting started, YouTube provided me a platform and a community where I could share music, experiences and moments with my fans,” Bieber said in a statement. “It feels great to partner with YouTube for this original documentary series. I want my fans to be part of this journey.”
Bieber, 25, will release a new song, “Yummy,” on Friday. His most recent album was “Purpose,” which features the hits “Sorry,” “Love Yourself,” “What Do You Mean?” and “Where Are U Now,” a collaboration with Diplo and Skrillex which won Bieber his first-ever Grammy Award.
YouTube says the series will “feature a behind-the-scenes look at Bieber’s private life, including never-before-seen footage of his wedding to Hailey Bieber and his day-to-day alongside those in his inner circle.” The series will also show Bieber reflecting “on the highs and lows of growing up in the public eye as he invites his fans on the journey leading up to the release of the highly-anticipated and most personal album of his career.”

71,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/sharon-stones-dating-profile-restored-after-being-blocked/,"LOS ANGELES: Sharon Stone can now return to mingling on Bumble without being kicked off the dating app.
A Bumble spokesperson said in a statement Monday that Stone’s profile has been restored after it was “mistakenly” blocked. The 61-year-old Golden Globe-winning actress said on Twitter the day before that Bumble closed her account and she asked, “Is being me exclusionary? Don’t shut me out the hive.”
Bumble apologized for the confusion but thought users could have viewed Stone’s profile as fake because there was no verification.
“Being the icon that she is, we can understand how so many of our users felt it was too good to be true once they noticed her profile wasn’t photo verified,” the statement said. “Photo verification is just one of the many ways to connect with confidence on Bumble.”
Bumble extended an offer to host Stone for a few hours of profile prep at their headquarters in Austin, Texas.

Stone is best known for starring in the 1992 drama “Basic Instinct” and the 1995 crime film “Casino.” She has been married twice, the first to producer Michael Greenburg and then journalist Phil Bronstein, who she divorced in 2004.
The actress’ rep didn’t immediately return an email message from The Associated Press.

72,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/skywalker-rises-again-little-women-go-big-at-box-office/,"LOS ANGELES: “Star Wars” was still rising in the last weekend of the year, while “Little Women” broke big at the box office.
“Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” brought in $72 million over the weekend to remain the top-earning film in North America by light-years, according to studio estimates Sunday.

In 10 days of release it has brought in $362.8 million for Disney, falling just short of the earnings of its predecessor, 2017’s “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” in a comparable span.
Helped by the Christmas holiday week, “Star Wars” had a smaller-than-average 59% drop-off in its second weekend after earning $175 million in its first.
“For a movie that opened that big, that is a modest drop,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “Movies that open this time of year, they usually have legs.”
Sony’s “Jumanji: The Next Level,” earned $35.3 million for second place and has tallied a total of $175.5 million through its third weekend of release.
Director Greta Gerwig’s re-imagining of the American literary classic “Little Women” had a $16.5-million weekend and a five-day total of $29 million since its Christmas opening, a major performance for a smaller-audience film with a budget dwarfed by the top two films.
The film, also a Sony release, starring Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Laura Dern, scored big with both audiences and critics and is gaining momentum as an awards-season favorite.
“With Greta Gerwig’s reputation as a filmmaker, a great cast and a perfect holiday release date, they’ve got quite a hit on the their hands,” Dergarabedian said.
“Uncut Gems,” an even smaller film that has also sparked awards-season buzz for Adam Sandler’s rare dramatic performance as a jeweler and gambling addict, entered the top 10 for the first time as it expanded to more screens in its first week. The film earned $9.6 million over the weekend and has brought in $20 million overall.
Director Sam Mendes’ experimental World War I epic “1917,” earned more than $1 million since its Christmas opening despite showing in only 11 theaters. The huge per-screen average bodes well for the film’s nationwide opening next month as it ramps up its Oscars campaign.
As 2019 ends, annual overall box office revenue is down by 4%, though it gained ground in its latter months, narrowing a deficit that was 11% in April, and 2018 was always going to be tough to beat.
“Last year was an outlier,” Dergarabedian said. “It was just a massive year.”
Between Marvel and “Star Wars,” and its animation divisions, 2019 was utterly owned by Disney, which had all five of the year’s top grossing movies: “Avengers: Endgame,” “The Lion King,” “Toy Story 4,” “Captain Marvel” and “Frozen 2.”
And with “The Rise of Skywalker” ending the year at No. 7 and “Aladdin” at No. 8, the mega-mouse ate up seven of the top 10 spots.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.
1. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” $72 million, ($94.3 million international).
2. “Jumanji: The Next Level,” $35.3 million ($61.6 million international).
3. “Little Women,” $16.5 million, ($6.3 million international).
4. “Frozen 2,” $16.5 million, ($42.2 million international).
5. “Spies in Disguise,” $13.2 million, ($16 million international).
6. “Knives Out,” $9.7 million ($6 million international).
7. “Uncut Gems,” $9.6 million.
8. “Cats,” $4.83 million, ($13.6 million international).
9. “Bombshell,” $4.7 million, ($157,000 international).
10. “Richard Jewell,” $3 million.

NEW YORK: Lindsey Vonn popped the question to hockey star PK Subban.
“Merry Christmas and happy holidays everyone!! On our 2 year anniversary, in a “non traditional” move, I asked PK to marry me and he said, Yes,” Vonn tweeted on Christmas Day. “Yes (bashful emoji) ! Women aren’t the only ones who should get engagement rings!”
The former ski racer closed the tweet with the hashtags “MerryChristmas” and “equality.”
Vonn linked a picture of herself and Subban with the ring, with the couple wearing matching striped pajamas in front of a Christmas tree with three dogs in the foreground. She also posted a close-up of Subban flashing the ring, with the words “Drip drip”and a blue teardrop.
Vonn also said on social media in August that they were engaged.
The 35-year-old Vonn recently retired from a skiing career that included three Olympic medals, four overall World Cup titles and 82 World Cup race wins, a record for a woman.
The 30-year-old Subban and won the 2013 Norris Trophy with Montreal as the NHL’s top defenseman. He was traded to New Jersey from Nashville in June.
Vonn had a high-profile relationship with Tiger Woods. She previously was married to former ski racer Thomas Vonn, and kept his last name after they separated.

75,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/disney-cuts-lesbian-kiss-from-star-wars-in-singapore/,"KUALA LUMPUR: Disney has cut a lesbian kiss from the latest “Star Wars” movie – one of the top Christmas films – Singapore’s media regulator said on Tuesday, so that more children can watch it.
The two minor female characters embrace but do not kiss in the version of “The Rise of Skywalker” shown in Singapore, local media said, as the ninth and final film in the celebrated science-fiction series rakes in millions from loyal fans.
“The applicant has omitted a brief scene which under the Film Classification Guidelines would require a higher rating,” a spokeswoman from Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Disney, which owns the “Star Wars” production company Lucasfilm, did not respond to a request for comment on its decision to cut the scene from the last installment of the second highest-grossing movie franchise of all time.
It concludes a story that began in 1977, when filmmaker George Lucas introduced a young hero named Luke Skywalker and delighted audiences with a galaxy of robots, furry warriors known as Wookiees and a host of other eclectic characters.
Sex between men is illegal in Singapore and punishable with up to two years in prison, though the British colonial-era law is rarely enforced. The law does not apply to sex between women.
Singapore activists challenged the law last month as polls suggested attitudes toward homosexuality are softening and similar legislation was scrapped in India last year.
The film is rated PG-13 in Singapore without the kiss scene, meaning parental guidance is advised for children below 13. Higher ratings mean it could be restricted only to viewers aged 16, 18 or 21 and above.
In 2016, the Singapore organisers of the musical “Les Miserables” removed a scene in which two male actors kiss after complaints from the public.
Disney declined to respond to a question about censorship in other markets, including the Middle East, amid media reports that lesbian kiss has also been deleted from screenings of “The Rise of Skywalker” in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

UNCASVILLE: Organizers wanted to make it clear the 99th Miss America competition isn’t your grandmother’s beauty pageant, and their winner did just that on Thursday.
Virginia biochemist Camille Schrier won the crown just minutes after wowing the crowd with science. Dressed in a lab coat, she gave a colorful chemistry demonstration of the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.
Schrier, a native of Pennsylvania, said she hopes to “break stereotypes about what it means to be a Miss America in 2020” by being a “woman of science” who is authentic to herself.
“I’m not the beauty queen,” she said. “I’m the brand ambassador for this organization and I’m more than just someone with a crown on my head.”
Victoria Hill of Georgia placed first runner-up.
No longer called contestants, the 51 women “candidates,” who hailed from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, competed for a $50,000 scholarship and the “job” of Miss America, a one-year paid position they hope to use as a public platform for their “social impact initiative.”
For the second year in a row, women were not judged in a swimsuit or how they look in an evening gown. Instead, a series of interviews and talent demonstrations will determine who is best qualified to wear this year’s crown.
“To make it relevant for these young women, it was important for us as a scholarship and service organization to make sure that we were reflective of this generation, meaning that you no longer had to be defined by some sort of ideal,” said Regina Hopper, president & CEO of the Miss America Organization.
Schrier, 24, who spoke on stage about having tackled an eating disorder, said she decided to compete for Miss America after the swimsuit competition was ditched, along with other changes that have been made to modernize the organization.
“I kind of figured that I would never get on that stage because I was a woman who did not want to get into a swimsuit on stage. And I didn’t have a performing talent, which is really ironic now,” she said, adding how she’s the first Miss America to win with a science experiment, a presentation she brings to schools.
Schrier is a cum laude graduate of Virginia Tech with dual bachelor of science degrees in bio chemistry and systems biology and she is currently studying to obtain a doctor of pharmacy degree.￼ Her platform issue is drug safety.
Morgan Nichols, Miss South Carolina, had her own message on Thursday night. She walked down the red carpet wearing a billowing, long skirt topped by a plain white T-shirt that read: “Stronger.”
While Hopper acknowledges there has been some push-back from “old pageant” people who liked the old way of doing things, she said there’s been greater interest in the competition since the roll-out of Miss America 2.0.
When asked on stage whether the Miss America organization should change even more and allow married women and women with children to participate, both Schrier and Hill said no. Schrier told reporters afterward that she believes the job would be too busy for a mother.
This year also marked the first time the multi-day event is being held at Mohegan Sun, a tribal casino and entertainment complex in suburban southeastern Connecticut. Miss America organizers announced plans this summer to leave Atlantic City, New Jersey — for the second time in its history.
Miss America also switched from ABC back to NBC to broadcast the glitzy finale to an estimated 4.5 million viewers. And for the first time, preliminary events and the finale — held in Mohegan’s 10,000-seat arena — are being streamed live on the NBC app.
“We’ve had many, many large events. This probably reaches the most people,” said Jeff Hamilton, president and general manager of Mohegan Sun. “We’re just really, really excited about it.”
Miss America organizers and NBC have not yet agreed to a multi-year contract with the Connecticut casino. A decision is expected in the coming months.
Schrier succeeds 2019 Miss America Nia Franklin, a classically trained opera singer from New York.
The decision to drop the swimsuit competition did create great controversy and criticism of Miss America officials, including former board chair and former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, who said in 2018 that Miss America would represent “a new generation of female leaders focused on scholarship, social impact, talent and empowerment.” Carlson has since stepped down.
Atlantic City businessmen came up with the idea for a pageant in 1921 as a way to extend the summer tourism season beyond Labor Day weekend. It became synonymous with the New Jersey seaside resort but moved to Las Vegas in 2005, returning to Atlantic City in 2013.

77,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/little-miss-period-tackles-japans-menstruation-taboos-with-a-punch/,"
TOKYO: Her timing can be terrible and she can pack a mean punch.
But “Little Miss Period” – a pink blob with red lips and red pants who stars in a Japanese manga comic and movie of the same name – has a mission: breaking taboos in a society where talking about menstruation has been seen dirty or embarrassing.

The character has generally been received positively as a step toward better understanding among the sexes. Some critics, though, worry about stereotypes and inattention to underlying gender discrimination that holds back Japanese women in many fields.
“Until now, menstruation has been something to hide and many people completely lack correct understanding of it,” said Kazue Muta, a sociology professor at Osaka University.
“I can’t praise the manga 100% … but it would be good if it were a step toward greater openness and education.”
The movie “Little Miss Period” was released domestically by entertainment company Yoshimoto Kogyo Co Ltd last month. It is based on a manga by male artist Ken Koyama that debuted in 2017 before being compiled into a book by publisher Kadokawa.
The film also opened in Taiwan this month and will debut in Hong Kong in January. Premieres in China and across Southeast Asia are also planned.
The topic of menstruation caught public attention in Japan recently when department store Daimaru suggested female employees wear a “period badge” to alert co-workers to their cycle. The plan sparked accusations of harassment and the store is reconsidering.
In the manga series, Little Miss Period – “Seiri-chan” in Japanese – delivers a punch to the gut that lays some women out flat before drawing blood with a syringe. When a woman’s husband fails to sympathise, he gets a “period punch” of his own to help him understand.
History gets a nod, with the tale of a feudal era Japanese girl forced to stay in a secluded hut because of the belief that menstruating females are unclean.
The movie version focuses on Aoko, a publishing firm editor whose male boss shows little compassion for her monthly pain. Aoko’s widower boyfriend is raising a young daughter. “If only men could get periods, even just once a year,” Aoko laments.
Feminist author Minori Kitahara welcomed efforts to break taboos but lamented that the representations were “treating the matter like a comedy talk show.”
Nobuyoshi Yoshida, 33, said he found the movie instructive. “Men don’t get how harsh menstruation can be for some women,” he said as he exited a cinema. “This was easy to understand.”
His girlfriend Kumiko Hanazawa, 32, was succinct: “I want men to watch this.”

78,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/anna-karina-the-icon-of-french-new-wave-cinema-dies-at-79/,"PARIS: Anna Karina, the French New Wave actress who became an icon of the cinema in the 1960s and was the muse of Jean-Luc Godard, has died. She was 79.
The French culture minister announced her death on Twitter on Sunday. French media said that the Danish-born Karina had cancer and died Saturday.

”Her look was the look of the New Wave. It will remain so forever,” Culture Minister Franck Riester tweeted.
“Anna Karina radiated. She magnetized the entire world,”‘ Riester said, adding that ”French cinema has lost one of its legends.”
Karina made seven films with Godard, her partner at the time, including the 1961 “Une Femme Est Une Femme” (A Woman is a Woman), in which she played a femme fatale. For that, she received the best actress award at the Berlin Film Festival. Other cult Godard movies starring Karina included the 1962 “Vivre Sa Vie'” (Live Your Life) and the 1965 “Pierrot Le Fou.”
Karina captured film-goers with her large blue doe eyes and acting and singing talents.
The French New Wave broke with traditional cinematic conventions to create a fresh approach to making movies, in keeping with the free-spirited times.
Godard wasn’t the only director with whom Karina worked. Jacques Rivette’s 1966 film “La Religieuse” (The Nun), adapted from the 18th-century French novel by Diderot, was initially banned. The story of a young woman forced into the convent by her mother, who had given birth out of wedlock, was revived in a restored version and presented at the 2018 Cannes film festival.
Born Hanne Karin Blarke Bayer in Denmark, she initially modelled and sang in cabarets before coming to France. She was reportedly discovered, and renamed, by Coco Chanel, then discovered by Godard.
Karina also worked, among other illustrious directors, with Luchino Visconti.
In a bold undertaking at the time, the actress later got behind the camera to make her own movie in 1973, “Vivre Ensemble” (Living Together).
Films that Karina has appeared in will be shown on the silver screen again with a retrospective of Godard starting next month at the Cinemateque, a noted film institution in France which she had frequented.

KATHMANDU: After successfully performing in Brisbane, Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart, Nepal’s famous folk-rock band, Nepathya, captivated the full-house audience at Big Top Auditorium in Luna Park of Sydney, Australia, on Saturday.
Performing for the fifth time in Sydney, Nepathya, entertained the audience with their mix of old and new songs with a great effect of the latest technology at the sold-out auditorium this weekend.
With this show, Sydney hosted Nepathya’s concert for the record fifth time. Nepathya has already performed more than five times in Kathmandu, Pokhara, Butwal, Chitwan, Hetauda and Dhangadhi within Nepal.
As the show went on, band’s lead singer and social activist Amrit Gurung said, “I still remember our first concert ten years ago as there were fewer Nepalis living in Sydney. However, during the last decade, Nepali diaspora has migrated looking for opportunities all over the globe.”
“Nepal would be a prosperous nation if it could do enough to stop the flow of brain-drain in the near future,” Amrit Gurung added.
“I see future in youths like you, who have gained knowledge, skills and experience in a foreign land, to transform the course of the nation like ours. Although our predecessors failed to create opportunities for us, we should be able for the next generation in Nepal, “Amrit Gurung shared.
As usual, Gurung was supported by Dhurba Lama on drums, Suraj Thapa on keyboards, Subin Shakya on bass guitar, Niraj Gurung on guitars and Shanti Raymajhi on madal.
After the Sydney show, Nepathya’s concert entourage will head to final stop-over in Melbourne to perform on December 23, the band said.
Nepathaya is currently touring Australia for the fifth time with new music series.

82,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/lemonade-by-beyonce-is-named-the-aps-album-of-the-decade/,"NEW YORK: The top 15 albums of the decade by Associated Press Music Editor Mesfin Fekadu:

Beyoncé, “Lemonade”: At the beginning of this decade, Beyoncé was already the greatest singer of her generation. She won a record six Grammys in a single night, had women AND MEN “oh-oh-oh’ing” to the fun sound of “Single Ladies” and continued to be a beast of a performer. But somehow Superwoman — shoot, she’s Superman, too! — found a way to do more: Like a boss she launched her own company, Parkwood Entertainment, and really took the bull by the horns of her career. In 2011, she released the R&B adventure “4,” featuring classics like “Countdown,” “Love on Top,” “Party,” “End of Time,” “I Care” and “I Miss You.” Three years later — in surprise form — came “Beyoncé,” her bold, audacious and daring album that showcased a new side of Beyoncé: Goodbye was the girl who cared about topping the charts, and born was an artist, a true storyteller, a grown woman. Somehow, she topped herself again with “Lemonade,” which still tastes as good as it did when it was released in 2016. The usually private Beyoncé bares her soul on the album, singing about a troubled relationship, black pride and motherhood in a brave way. Lyrically, she’s on point and honest over beats and sounds that range from rap to rock to country and pop. “Who the (expletive) do you think I am,” she brashly asks on “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” which co-stars Jack White. The answer: the greatest of all time.
Rihanna, “Anti”: Something was in the water in 2016: Beyoncé delivered “Lemonade” and Rihanna gave us the best album of her career with “Anti.” Rihanna had been moving like the Energizer Bunny since releasing her first album in 2005. She also put out albums in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 — showing that she was a singer who knew how to pick a hit, record it and make it sound better than any other artist could. But she took four years to create “Anti,” and the time was used wisely. No need to hit the skip button on this album as Rihanna shows her sultry side on “Kiss It Better,” her twerk side on “Work” and her vocal chops on “Love on the Brain.” Her hard work, work, work, work, work, work has truly paid off.


Beyoncé, “Beyoncé”: See earlier entry.
Adele, “21”: Back in my day — well in 2010 — record labels sent albums months in advance, and in November 2010 I received Adele’s “21.” Everything else around had to be turned off. I was sucked in. Months later, so was the world. THE ENTIRE WORLD. Adele was impressive on her 2008 debut, especially on “Hometown Glory,” but with “21” she went deep, too deep, she was rolling in the deep! Literally. Each song made you feel something — sad, lonely, bouncy, fired up, calm, angry, lost. And nine years later, each song sounds as classic as they did at first listen, especially “Turning Tables,” “Set Fire to the Rain” and the incomparable “Someone Like You.”
Kendrick Lamar, “good kid, m.A.A.d city”: All of Kendrick Lamar’s albums released this decade have been masterpieces, including the 2011 independent release “Section.80” as well as the major-label projects “To Pimp a Butterfly” and “DAMN.,” which won him the Pulitzer Prize for music as he made history as the first non-classical or jazz artist to win the prestigious prize. Lamar has profoundly mixed his poetry with hip-hop, jazz, soul, funk and African music to create songs that tackle blackness, street life, police brutality, survival and self-worth. And with 2012’s “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” this great kid immediately raised the bar not in only in hip-hop, but in music period, forcing his peers to do better and try harder.
HAIM, “Days Are Gone”: The sister trio HAIM reached perfection on their debut album. Hit play. And that is all.
SZA, “Ctrl”: SZA is masterful and introspective on her confessional debut album, which follows a young woman going through life and the turbulent experiences that come with it, from dating dusty boys to dealing with self-doubt.


Janelle Monáe, “The ArchAndroid”: According to contemporary pop folklore, Janelle Monae arrived on the pop landscape from another planet, and boy do we need more artists from that sphere to land here now. On the beautifully theatrical “The ArchAndroid,” she brilliantly paints the picture of an android, Cindi Mayweather, who finds out she is the chosen one and is trying to figure out how to handle her newfound mission. The versatile album has so many highpoints, including the Fela-flavored “Dance or Die,” the playful “Tightrope,” the groovy “Locked Inside” and the addictive “Faster.”
Katy Perry, “Teenage Dream”: I’ll quote the opening line of my 2010 “Teenage Dream” review, which came before the album matched the record Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” set by launching five No.1 hits: “Katy Perry’s new CD is like a magical slot machine: Select any song and you’ll hear a hit.”
Bruno Mars, “24K Magic”: Bruno Mars released three epic albums this decade, but “24K Magic” was a whole mood.
Solange, “A Seat at the Table”: Solange’s art-piece of an album will move you to think, and sing along, at the same time.
Sam Smith, “In the Lonely Hour”: Unrequited love ruled Sam Smith’s debut album, introducing the world to a piercing voice that is brave and honest.
Nas, “Life Is Good”: Nas is still the best rapper alive. Don’t at me.
Taylor Swift, “1989”: After dabbling in it on “Red,” former country singer Taylor Swift hopped, skipped and jumped into the pop music world with “1989,” an adventurous album full of hits, hits and more hits.
Kacey Musgraves, “Golden Hour”: With timeless songs like “Space Cowboy,” “Butterflies,” “Slow Burn” and “Lonely Weekend,” Kacey Musgraves proved to not just be golden, but grand.

84,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/frozen-2-leads-box-office-again-playmobil-flops/,"NEW YORK: “Frozen 2” blanketed multiplexes for the third straight weekend, continuing its reign at No. 1 with $34.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.
The Walt Disney Co animated sequel has already grossed $919.7 million worldwide. It will soon become the sixth Disney release this year to cross $1 billion, a record sure to grow to seven once “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” hits theatres later this month. Early next week, Disney will cross $10 billion at the global box office this year.

But the weekend overall at the box office was yet another disappointing one for the movie industry. A handful of under-performing releases and a relatively thin wide-release schedule hasn’t helped the 5.6% slide in domestic ticket sales from last year, according to data firm Comscore.
This weekend produced an outright flop in “Playmobil: The Movie,” the week’s only new wide release. The STX Films release was never expected to do well, but it bombed so thoroughly that it will rank among the worst-performing wide-releases ever. It grossed $668,000 in 2,337 venues, giving it a per-theatre average of just $286.
A handful of companies combined to produce the $75 million French film, including Wild Bunch and Pathe.
The top five films were almost unchanged from last weekend.
Rian Johnson’s acclaimed, star-studded whodunit “Knives Out” remained in second place with $14.2 million, declining a modest 47% in its second week of release. With $63.5 million cumulatively and $124.1 million worldwide, the Lionsgate release has been one of the season’s bright spots.
So has James Mangold’s “Ford v Ferrari,” which stayed in third place with $6.5 million over its fourth weekend. The racing drama, starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, has sped to a global take of $168 million for Disney, which acquired the film’s original studio, 20th Century Fox, earlier this year. The film cost about $100 million to make.
Melina Matsoukas’ outlaw romance “Queen & Slim” moved up to fourth in its second week with $6.5 million, swapping places with Marielle Heller’s Mister Rogers drama “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” ($5.2 million in its third weekend).
Todd Haynes’ true-story legal drama “Dark Waters,” starring Mark Ruffalo as a defense attorney who takes on the DuPont chemical company, expanded nationwide to 2,011 theatres. The Focus Features release made $4.1 million.
Celine Sciamma’s acclaimed period romance “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” opened at two locations with a very strong $33,552 per-theatre average. Neon will release the French film wider in February.
Some of the weekend’s most widespread movie watching may have been on Netflix, though the streaming service doesn’t disclose viewership tallies or box-office receipts.
After a three-week theatrical run, Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story,” one of the year’s most critically acclaimed films, began streaming Friday. On Friday, Nielsen said Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” last weekend drew an average audience of 13.6 million viewers from Nov. 27 to Dec. 1. Netflix has said Nielsen numbers, which only estimate US viewership, reflect an incomplete picture.
Amazon likewise didn’t release ticket sales for “The Aeronauts,” which opened in 52 theatres over the weekend. Tom Harper’s film, which cost $40 million to make, stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as 19th century balloonists.
A week before it opens in North America, Sony’s “Jumanji: The Next Level” debuted in 18 international countries where it made $52.5 million. The sequel to 2017’s “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” which grossed $962 million worldwide, is expected to lead the box office next weekend.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at US and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

“Frozen 2,” $34.7 million ($90.2 million international).
“Knives Out,” $14.2 million ($18 million international).
“Ford v Ferrari,” $6.5 million ($8.3 million international).
“Queen & Slim,” $6.5 million.
“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” $5.2 million.
“Dark Waters,” $4.1 million.
“21 Bridges,” $2.9 million.
“Playing With Fire,” $2 million.
“Midway,” $1.9 million.
“Joker,” $1 million.

87,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/marriage-story-dominates-gotham-awards-with-4-wins/,"NEW YORK: Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” was the resounding winner at the IFP Gotham Awards, taking four awards including best feature at the annual New York awards-season kickoff.
By the end of the night on Monday, Baumbach, having long ago exhausted his one prepared speech, stood at the podium exhorting cast members Adam Driver and Laura Dern to lend him help. Having already given their own speeches — Driver for best actor, Dern as a tribute honoree — they demurred, content to watch Baumbach squirm again while he improvised a few remarks.

Baumbach turned, ultimately, to his actors — “My special effect, my everything is the cast,” he said — and to Netflix for what he called its “unconditional” support of his film, a portrait of divorce starring Driver and Scarlett Johansson. Earlier, Baumbach thanked Netflix, too, for saving the Manhattan single-screen Paris Theatre, which the streaming company purchased last week.
Praise for Netflix and its chief content creative officer Ted Sarandos, who was also in attendance, was a common refrain throughout the evening. The streaming service, which filled up numerous tables at the banquet at Cipriani’s Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, also celebrated wins for Ava DuVernay’s Central Park Five series “When They See Us,” (DuVernay was additionally singled out for tribute) and the documentary “American Factory.”
The Gothams, now in their 29th year, is the premier New York gala for independent film, a kind of earlier East Coast corollary to Los Angeles’ Independent Film Spirit Awards in February. Put on by the nonprofit Independent Film Project with nominees selected by committees, Gotham winners can diverge from seasonal favourites. Last year, Chloe Zhao’s lyrical Western “The Rider” took the best feature.
But a recent stretch of Gotham winners went on to land best picture at the Academy Awards, including Barry Jenkins’ “Moonlight,” Tom McCarthy’s “Spotlight” and Alejandro Inarritu’s “Birdman.”
And “Marriage Story,” which begins streaming Friday after playing for several weeks in theaters, seems sure to continue a long march through awards season. Acclaim has been heaped on its leads and its ensemble, and it’s been celebrated as a crowning achievement for the 50-year-old Baumbach.
While not a surprise to others, the most shocked winner of the evening was easily Awkwafina, who took the best actress for her performance in Lulu Wang’s family drama “The Farewell.”
“Oh my god. I never won anything. I can’t even win an argument in the Instagram comments,” said Awkwafina.
A handful of movies up for best feature — “Uncut Gems” with Adam Sandler, “Hustlers” with Jennifer Lopez — went home emptyhanded. Trey Edward Schultz’ ambitious family melodrama “Waves,” also up for best feature, scored an award for Taylor Russell as a breakthrough actor.
The Gotham Awards liberally sprinkle in tributes throughout the ceremony. This year’s honorees included Dern, DuVernay, Sam Rockwell, FilmNation chief executive Glen Basner and Jason DaSilva, a filmmaker and disability rights activist. DaSilva’s Emmy-winning documentary “When I Walk” chronicles his own experience with multiple sclerosis.
DuVernay shared her tips for directing, among them: treat actors and crew the same, don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know” and change your socks at lunchtime.
Both Baumbach and Greta Gerwig presented Dern with her award, donning what they called “Laura Dern sweaters” for the occasion. The two filmmakers, aside from living together as a couple with a son, share Dern in their latest movies. In “Marriage Story,” Dern plays a ruthless divorce attorney. In Gerwig’s “Little Women” (an upcoming Sony Pictures release ineligible for the Gothams), she plays Louisa May Alcott’s benevolent matriarch Marmee.
Gerwig and Baumbach swapped their speeches, which resulted in Baumbach declaring that he loved Dern “even more than Leonardo DiCaprio, who I sincerely believed I would someday marry.”
The Gothams reliably serve as pep rallies for independent cinema and those that toil in the ever-threatened lower-budgeted realm of moviemaking. Presenter Natasha Lyonne, whose Netflix series “Russian Doll” was nominated for best breakthrough series in episodes less than 40 minutes, evoked that sense of indie pride with more than a touch of sarcasm.
“If there’s one thing everyone in the room can agree on,” Lyonne said while presenting, “it’s that we can never have enough Batman movies.”

The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame band will play April 23 at Northern Kentucky University’s BB&T Arena, across the Ohio River 7 miles south of the Dec 3, 1979, concert site, where another two dozen people were injured Dec. 3, 1979, amid confusion and lack of preparation for thousands of fans lined up for hours for first-come seats.

The announcement came after WCPO-TV in Cincinnati aired a Tuesday night documentary featuring interviews with lead singer Roger Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend, the remaining original members of the British band that emerged in the 1960s featuring songs of youthful rebellion such as “My Generation” and its “Summertime Blues” cover.
Both have said they’ve been haunted by the tragedy. Townshend recently told The Associated Press he was looking forward to discussing it in Cincinnati.
“Now we can have a conversation about it when we go back,” Townshend said.
“We will meet people and we’ll be there. We’ll be there. That’s what’s important,” he said. “I’m so glad that we’ve got this opportunity to go back.”
The band is adding the concert to its “Moving On!” tour 2020 dates.
The Who said it will donate a portion of proceeds from the Cincinnati area concert to a memorial scholarship fund benefiting students in the Cincinnati suburb of Finneytown. Daltrey visited a Finneytown High School memorial site in 2018 and the band has for years supported the scholarship effort there. Three of the 11 killed, including two 15-year-old girls who were the youngest victims, had attended Finneytown High.
The band didn’t know about the tragedy until the concert was ending. Longtime manager Bill Curbishley had made the decision to have the show go on, warning Cincinnati authorities that they wouldn’t be able to control the crowd if the concert was called off.
“Despite everything, I still feel inadequate,” he told WCPO. “I don’t know about the guys, but for me, I left a little bit of my soul in Cincinnati.”

Hit animated movie takes inspiration from Sámi culture
Sámi people live in northern Europe
“Frozen 2” dubbed in North Sámi, rare move for a blockbuster

OSLO: The sequel to Walt Disney Co’s 2013 hit animated musical “Frozen” is generating excitement among indigenous Sámi people in northern Europe, whose culture the movie has taken inspiration from.
“Frozen 2” debuted in US cinemas on Nov 22 and is progressively rolling out worldwide. On its debut weekend, it grossed $350 million, making it “the biggest opening ever for Walt Disney Animation (not including Pixar)”, according to Hollywood trade publication Variety. The movie opens in Norway on Christmas Day.

Norway inspired many elements of the first “Frozen” movie, such as character Anna’s dress or the architecture of the fictional kingdom of Arendelle.
The second film takes inspiration from the culture of the Sámi, an indigenous minority living across Norway, Sweden, Finland and northern Russia, who have faced discrimination against their language and culture.
In Norway, a state-appointed truth and reconciliation commission is investigating the discrimination perpetrated on minorities including the Sámi and Kven peoples.
“I am planning to see the movie again with my whole family,” said Aili Keskitalo, president of the consultative Sámi Parliament in Norway, who attended the film’s world premiere in Los Angeles with her 11-year-old daughter and set a scene from the movie as her Facebook profile picture.
“Frozen 2” sees Anna and sister Elsa head north of Arendelle to find out the truth about a mystery. They meet the Northuldra, who live closely with the reindeer. Reindeer herding is a traditional Sámi activity.
“Some of the beautiful costumes in the film took inspiration from our gákti. They also took inspiration from the guksi, our traditional wooden cup,” said Anne Lajla Utsi, a member of a Sámi advisory group that collaborated with the filmmakers.
“We felt they really listened and that it was very important to them to do this right,” Utsi, managing director of the International Sámi Film Institute, told Reuters.
Disney signed a contract with Sámi representatives to commit themselves to portray their culture respectfully. That included supporting the dubbing of the movie in North Sámi, the most spoken of the Sámi languages, and release it at the same time as the Norwegian version.
When Utsi posted a picture of the “Frozen 2” poster on Facebook with its Sámi title, “Jikŋon 2”, it went viral.
“My youngest daughter is really looking forward to watching the movie again in her language,” said Keskitalo.
“My elder daughters, who are 22 and 25 years old, are also very excited about seeing the movie. It is not often that we see a movie in North Sámi. I think a lot of adults will see the movie too.” (

90,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/k-pop-singer-sentenced-to-6-years-in-jail-for-rape-sharing-secret-sex-videos/,"SEOUL: A South Korean court sentenced a K-pop musician to six years in prison on Friday for raping a woman and distributing a video capturing the act in a case that drew attention to the darker side of the country’s lucrative entertainment industry.
Jung Joon-young, 30, was arrested in March. Choi Jong-hoon, 30, a former member of South Korean boy band FT Island, was also sentenced to five years in prison for the rape of the woman.
Both were members of online chat groups that shared secret sex tapes and made jokes about drugging and raping women, the Seoul Central District Court said.
Jung’s conviction also includes the illegal distribution of other videos he took secretly while having sex with women. The identities of the victims were suppressed to protect their privacy.
The court also sentenced each man to 80 hours in “sexual violence treatment” education.
“The defendants are well-known celebrities and friends, but the chat they’ve had showed that they simply considered women as objects of sexual pleasure, and committed crimes that were extremely serious,” Judge Kang Seong-soo said as he handed down the verdict.
“Strict punishment is inevitable as the damage inflicted has not properly been recovered and the victims demand harsh penalties.”
Jung admitted distributing the video and others he took, though he argued the sex was in all cases consensual. Choi denied raping the woman, and had argued that he did not remember having sex with her and that if he had, it was likely consensual.
Lawyers for Jung and Choi could not be reached for comment.
Their case was one of several scandals involving sex crimes and other illegal activity that revealed a dark side of an industry at the centre of the global K-pop craze.
Lee Seung-hyun, a former member of K-pop group Big Bang better known by the stage name Seungri, is also on trial over accusations he paid for prostitutes for foreign businessmen to drum up investment in his business.

HONG KONG: Taiwanese-Canadian model-actor Godfrey Gao has died after suffering an apparent heart attack while on set in China.
Gao was filming a sports reality show in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo on Wednesday when he died. His agency, JetStar Entertainment, confirmed his death on its official Facebook page.
The 35-year-old was filming “Chase Me,” a Chinese variety series, when he reportedly fell while running. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to his agency.
The Taiwan-born Gao initially rose to fame by becoming the first Asian male model for the luxury brand Louis Vuitton. He acted in numerous television dramas and movies, including a role in the Hollywood film “The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.”
His body will be transported Wednesday to Taipei, Taiwan’s capital.

92,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/singer-goo-haras-death-shines-light-on-dark-side-of-k-pop/,"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA: The death of South Korean singer and actress Goo Hara, whose body was found at her home in Seoul this week, has again shone a spotlight on pressures that stars, especially females, face in the cutthroat K-pop industry and in deeply conservative South Korean society.
Goo’s death at age 28 came less than two months after the death of Choi Jin-ri, or Sulli, another K-pop star and Goo’s close friend. Experts say both Goo and Choi faced extensive cyberbullying and sexual harassment from the public and media throughout their careers, which took a toll on their mental health.

Police say they are still investigating Goo’s death and found a “pessimistic note” at her home.
Once popular mostly in Asia, K-pop has spread far beyond South Korea, thanks to wildly popular groups such as “BTS” and “Blackpink.”
Goo debuted in 2008 as part of the five-member girl group Kara, which shot almost immediately to fame and helped pioneer the K-pop global phenomenon.
She later launched a successful solo career in South Korea and Japan.
Sulli began her career around the same time as Goo, debuting as a member of the girl band f(x) in 2009. She also had multiple acting roles after stepping away from her singing career.
Goo made headlines when she took her former boyfriend, Choi Jong-bum, to court last year. Choi claimed to have been assaulted by her, while Goo accused him of threatening to release a sex video of her.
During the dispute, Goo’s Korean agency didn’t renew her contract. A court sentenced Choi to 1 ½ years in prison on charges of coercion and assaulting and blackmailing Goo. The jail term was suspended, keeping him out of prison. Choi appealed and the trial is still ongoing.
K-pop is highly competitive, with dozens of groups debuting each year. Industry experts have long warned about the dark side of the scandal-ridden industry. Aspiring artists, as young as their early teens, train for years. Only a few debuts and even fewer are commercially successful. The likelihood of their success increases if they sign with a handful of top entertainment agencies.
The industry is known to have strict rules for their stars — including dating bans, spartan training and diets, and sometimes slave-like and unfair contracts. Experts say the industry has additional requirements for its female artists, unspoken rules reflective of South Korea’s patriarchal society.
Park Hee-A, a K-pop journalist and writer of “Interviews with K-pop Stars,” said female stars are bound by rigid societal rules of femininity.
“Some female idol members have gotten ostracized for not smiling in a television show and reading a book about feminism that contradicts male-dominated patriarchal South Korean society,” Park told The Associated Press.
Expectations of purity and chastity govern women in South Korea. Goo faced a barrage of hate comments following media reports about the sex video despite her being the victim of revenge porn.
“The topic of sex is taboo in South Korea compared to western countries,” said Tae-Sung Yeum, attending psychiatrist at Gwanghwamun Forest Psychiatric Clinic. “There’s a high moral standard required, especially for female celebrities, because South Korea is a patriarchal society.”
Sulli, Goo’s long-time friend, also made headlines, often malicious and misogynistic, for speaking out about subjects such as ageism and feminism. She was criticized for wearing shirts without a bra, calling older male colleagues by their first names and openly supporting feminism.
Yeum said it’s difficult for K-pop stars to seek professional help for depression, especially in a country where many people believe that psychiatric disorders can be “treated with one’s will.” He said multiple suicides in the industry stem from stars being plunged into a hypercompetitive system with a plethora of abuses from a young age.
When Sulli was found dead in her Seongnam home, Goo bid farewell to her friend in a live-streamed video. “I will live more diligently for you,” Goo cried while apologizing for not being able to make it to her funeral.
Two days before Goo’s death, she uploaded a final selfie on her Instagram with the caption, “Good night.”

At the end of a year that saw musicians like Niall Horan and Ed Sheeran gingerly dip their toes into other languages, Coldplay have responded: Hold my European beer.
Their new album, “Everyday Life,” is so utterly embracing of the world that has words spoken or sung in Arabic, Spanish, Zulu and Igbo, and even a French verse sung by lead singer Chris Martin.
This cover image released by Parlophone/Atlantic shows “Everyday Life,” a release by Coldplay. Photo: Parlophone/Atlantic via AP
It’s a fluid and experimental 53-minute double album, divided into two halves, Sunrise and Sunset. If on 2015’s “A Head Full of Dreams,” the band sampled the likes of Barack Obama and a Rumi poem, now they’re doubling down.
“Everyday Life” is bursting with idiosyncratic references, ranging from the film “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” to a Bob Dylan lyric, a novel by Khaled Hosseini, audio of a bullying traffic stop by a cop in Philadelphia, an elegy to Africa, samples from Nigerian composer Harcourt Whyte and jazz legend Alice Coltrane, the South African activist song “Jikelele” and an exuberant tune about Syrian refugees (“Orphans,” which features a credit for Martin’s teenage son, Moses).
“Orphans” is really the only traditional-sounding Coldplay song. The others are often subdued, instrumental or undercooked. “I haven’t finished this one yet” say the liner notes on the stripped-down and fragmentary “WOTW/POTP.” It’s an astonishing, unsafe step from a band who could have just kept giving us “Something Like This.”
There are ambient sounds and snippets from films, including the documentaries “Everything Is Incredible” and “Fela Kuti: Music is the Weapon.” The band even seems to reference themselves (“Boom bo-boom boom” from “X Marks the Spot.”) Sometimes it feels less than an album and more like a multimedia project.
Fans will find that, sonically, the band has stepped off the dance floor. The new music is less bombastic and more intimate. “Old Friends” is a mournful ode to loss, while “Daddy” is sung from the heartbreaking perspective of an abandoned child. “Daddy are you OK?/Look dad we got the same hair.” There’s even spots of gospel and funk-jazz.
The band is also playing with time, with lyrics and credits seemingly created on an old typewriter and offering old timey band portraits that recall those famous shots of The Band.
There are also political songs — the menacing “Trouble in Town” and the sarcastic “Guns” — but most of the album is about faith — all faiths, from East Asian Buddhism to Pakistani Sufism.
It begins with a prayer in “Church” — “Oh, Father, God Almighty, why have you forsaken me?” — and ends 15 songs later with a soft thanksgiving Hallelujah, thanks to the gentle title track’s earnest plea for peace (sounding not unlike something from “Parachutes”)
“How in the world am I going to see/You as my brother not my enemy,” Martin sings. “Got to keep dancing when the lights go out.” In response to an ailing world, Coldplay are opening their arms wide and refusing to stop believing.

95,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/leonard-cohens-posthumous-album-centres-on-poetry/,"Leonard Cohen, “Thanks for the Dance” (Columbia/Legacy Recordings)
Leonard Cohen’s last album, released just weeks before he passed in 2016, was “You Want It Darker,” which had a sense of finality that made it a fine conclusion to his brilliant musical career.
“Thanks for the Dance,” on the other hand, seems to bring down the curtain on Cohen’s parallel universe, the poetry he started to publish long before he began making records.
Illustrating the point, the new nine-track set is more like a Cohen spoken-word performance with very good and empathetic musical backing, most of it composed by his son, Adam.
Understated exceptions are the title track and a few lines here and there, but Cohen doesn’t really sing, not that his resonant voice needs a melody to convey the experience, depth, humour, horror and beauty of his lyrics.
Expanding on recordings made mostly at the same time as the sessions for “You Want It Darker,” Adam Cohen and engineer/mixer Michael Chaves searched out some of the master’s previous collaborators and some new ones to complete the compositions. Among them are Sharon Robinson, Jennifer Warnes, the Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue Choir, Beck, Daniel Lanois, Feist, Javier Mas, Zac Rae, Patrick Leonard and Anjani Thomas.
“Happens to the Heart” opens the album with haunting guitar, laud and piano supporting Cohen’s listing of a life’s worth of experiences, the gentle accompaniment from Andre de Ridder’s stargaze orchestra making the lines even more effective — “I was always working steady/But I never called it art.”
The title track could be a sequel to “Take This Waltz,” a 1980s song with lyrics Cohen adapted from a poem by Federico García Lorca. Here the themes appear to be more personal but just as inspired.
Other highlights include the subtle flamenco airs of “The Night of Santiago,” the dark-as-night and terrifying “Puppets” and closer “Listen to the Hummingbird,” a short but wise and emotional epilogue.
“Thanks for the Dance” is like discovering a box of old letters — or in this case, poems — from a departed loved one. It’s an emotional experience that allows Cohen’s great talents to be appreciated again.

NEW YORK: Stocks ended slightly higher on Friday, helped by better-than-expected quarterly results from Google’s parent Alphabet and retailer Amazon and a modest recovery in oil prices.
However, the gains were held back by disappointing results from Exxon Mobil as well as news out of the Bank of Japan, which did not announce as much stimulus as many had hoped.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 24.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,432.24.
The Dow was held back partly by a drop in the oil giant Exxon Mobil. The company reported its smallest quarterly profit in 17 years, well below what analysts were looking for, due to the continuing weakness in oil prices. Its major competitor, Chevron, fared slightly better. While earnings dropped sharply from a year ago, Chevron’s results still beat analysts’ expectations.
Exxon fell $1.25, or 1.4 percent, to $88.95. Chevron climbed 69 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $102.48 after being down earlier in the day.
Broader market indicators ended higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,173.60 and the Nasdaq composite increased 7.15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,162.13.
Wall Street is finishing out its busiest week of corporate earnings, which was dominated by mostly strong results from technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and others.
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped $25.50, or 3.3 percent, to $791.34. The company reported earnings of $8.42 a share, well above the $8.04 that analysts were looking for.
Amazon rose $6.20, or 1 percent, to $758.81. The online retail giant reported a profit of $1.78 per share, well above the $1.11 a share that analysts expected. Amazon reported it sold $30.4 billion in goods in the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier.
The strong results from Amazon and Google, as well as the results from other tech companies, helped lift the technology-heavy Nasdaq 1.2 percent this week, while the Dow lost 0.8 percent. The S&P 500 closed the week down slightly. It was the first weekly loss for the S&P 500 after four weeks of gains.
So far, corporate profits appear to be coming well ahead of what were very low expectations. Earnings in the S&P 500 so far are down 2.4 percent from a year ago, which is better than the 5.2 percent decline expected when earnings season started, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“Expectations were exceptionally low for the second quarter. While consumers goods and technology has been better than expected, the energy sector continues to show challenges,” said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock.
Investors remain cautious, however. The run-up earlier this month made stocks more expensive than investors are historically comfortable with. The S&P 500 is trading at 18.5 times its expected earnings for the next year, noticeable above the 12-14 times investors typically look for.
The presidential election will continue to grow as an issue for markets in the next several months. Investors dislike uncertainty, and the unexpectedly close presidential election and mostly unknown policies of Donald Trump puts them on edge.
Next week another fifth of the S&P 500 will report their results, including Proctor & Gamble, General Motors, Kraft Heinz, 21st Century Fox and Allstate, among many others.
Moore also pointed out the July jobs report, released August 5, will give investors direction since the June and May jobs reports showed two clashing directions for the US economy.
Japan’s central bank ended a policy meeting Friday by announcing it will expand purchases of exchange traded funds from financial institutions to help inject more cash into the world’s third-largest economy and pursue its 2 percent inflation target. But the measures fell short of hopes for more aggressive action. That helped the yen surge as investors priced in fewer yen in circulation. The dollar dropped to 102.03 yen from 105.45 yen.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury note falling to 1.46 percent from 1.51 percent the day before.
In energy trading, benchmark US crude reversed earlier losses and was up 46 cents to close at $41.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 24 cents to $42.46 a barrel in London.
Heating oil rose less than 1 cent to $1.28 a gallon, wholesale gasoline futures rose 1 cent to $1.32 a gallon and natural gas fell was little changed at $2.88 per thousand cubic feet.
In other currencies, the euro rose to $1.1179 from $1.1073 the day before and the British pound rose to $1.3239 from $1.3148.

Five years after United Airlines and Continental merged, Munoz declared in a public letter published in national newspapers on Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015, that the combined company has failed to live up to the expectations of both fliers and United’s employees.

NEW YORK: Five years after United Airlines and Continental merged, the company’s new CEO declared in a public letter that the combined company has failed to live up to the expectations of both fliers and United’s employees.
Just three weeks into the job, CEO Oscar Munoz acknowledged in full-page newspaper ads that “the journey hasn’t always been smooth.”
Since the merger, United has been plagued with chronic delays, computer outages and dissatisfied workers, who have a reputation for taking out their frustrations on fliers. The problems overshadowed the tenure of former CEO Jeff Smisek, who took over the combined airline when the merger closed on Oct. 1, 2009.
On Sept. 8, Chicago-based United Continental Holdings said Smisek was ousted following an internal investigation into the airline’s dealing with the public agency that operates its hub airport in Newark, New Jersey. That agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is part of a federal investigation into abuse of power. Munoz, a railroad executive and head of United’s audit committee, was named president and CEO.
In his letter, which ran in national newspapers, Munoz didn’t offer any hints as to how he will actually fix United’s many problems except that he will listen to fliers and employees.
“We are committed to re-earning your trust,” he wrote.
The company set up a website, UnitedAirtime.com, for people to ask questions and provide feedback to the airline. The airline posted a few questions and answers in advance of the site’s launch that focus on delayed luggage delivery, aging airplanes that lack Wi-Fi or working TVs and the poor quality of first-class meals.
“Let’s be honest, the implementation of the United and Continental merger has been rocky for customers and employees,” Munoz says on a video greeting on the site. “While it’s been improving recently, we still haven’t lived up to our promise or our potential.”

WASHINGTON: US manufacturers expanded at their slowest pace in two years last month, held back by faltering global growth and cutbacks in oil and gas drilling.
The Institute for Supply Management says its index of factory activity fell sharply to 50.2 in September from 51.1 in August. That is the lowest level since May 2013. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders and production both fell sharply and a measure of hiring also declined, according to the ISM, a trade group of purchasing managers. All three still barely remained in expansion territory.
US manufacturers are getting hit by slower growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy, and a stronger dollar, which makes US goods more expensive overseas. Oil and gas drillers are also cutting back on their orders for steel pipe and other goods in the wake of sharply lower oil prices.
China’s factory activity contracted last month, according to a survey of its purchasing managers, though its manufacturing index inched up to 49.8 from 49.7 in August.
Manufacturers cut 15,000 jobs last month, the most in five years, payroll services provider ADP said Wednesday. The government will release its jobs report Friday, and economists forecast it will show that the economy added 206,000 jobs overall.
The unemployment rate is expected to remain at a seven-year low of 5.1 percent.
Most economists expect US manufacturing will do little for the economy for the rest of the year, with the possible exception of automakers. But so far, healthy consumer spending on cars, homes and restaurant meals is offsetting overseas weakness and driving modest growth.

Are we utilising resources to the best of our ability?
As Shahrukh Khan stated in the blockbuster film, ‘Chennai Express’ — “Don’t underestimate the power of a common man”, the financial markets can deliver the same phrase with a twist. Don’t underestimate the power of information! In the age of technology and information, the world of traders has been enveloped by numerous data and reports. Life, as the traders know it, has been surrounded by scores of data emancipating from various economies and every second matters in the race towards accomplishing profits. With the passage of time, global markets have provided innovative ways to look at the markets and the fundamentals within it. Given that global markets are operating 24 hours a day and five days a week, inevitably investors will enhance their knowledge levels.
In recent times, during market operation, information does stem out from every corner of the globe with astounding pace that traders need to keep an eye on every major economy around the globe. Given the markets is a convergent point for the constant flow of information, investors should weigh the data and incorporate the ones which one feels will be imperative to his trading strategies. Easier said than done, the preceding sentence might leave some readers with a raised eyebrow and an immediate question — how do I weigh the information or how can I know the importance of such information?
In the first few trades, it is important to follow the impact of such information and wait to enact on the appropriate trade. With experience, the trader will learn the importance of such information and incorporate similar strategies in the ensuing days too.
But given the importance of the word ‘information’, are we utilising resources to the best of our abilities? Having undertaken numerous training classes related to the markets, I have noticed that participants have not been keeping themselves updated with the latest developments from around the globe. It is next to impossible to throw the dart expecting to find the bull’s eye when darkness has clouded the room. However, with light, the task of finding the bull’s eye becomes a tad easier. Information is the light, guiding traders and making the process of trading more effective.
A mentor once said — “information from the markets, if interpreted and processed in the right manner, will always reap greater results in the forthcoming days.” In contemporary times, processing the given information is a major challenge for the prevailing investors. In theory, trading seems easier but when theory has to be converted into practice, life does not seem to be easy. However, with experience and practice, one will surely master the art of trading from the given processed information. Hence, information is the most important commodity in today’s global financial world.

FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

Martina Gautam
Morning shows the day. Youngest amongst the 13 girls, Martina Gautam believes in giving her best in whatever she does. A recent high school graduate, she wants to pursue Biomedical engineering in her undergraduate studies. Head strong about her goals, she leaves no opportunities behind to achieve them.
When EmpowHER came around, she knew what she needed to do. The idea of sharing the same platform with other like-minded women and learning new things excited her. She joined EmpowHER with a hope to improve her leadership skills, and bring back her experience and understandings to her students.
She has been working as a teacher since the last three years at a women’s school in her neighbourhood. Many of her students work as domestic helpers in dif ferent houses in the community. In exchange for school fees, many young women from rural Nepal travel to the capital to work as domestic helpers. Despite mistreatment and abuse, these girls stay with their host families so that they can receive free schooling. But most of them do not even get to go to school, and even if they do they cannot concentrate and lag behind in their classes due to over workload. Therefore, through her EmpowHER ‘Impact Service Project’ Martina will provide free coaching classes to help these girls with their assignments and class works including sessions on ESL, mathematics, and computer courses. Based on their performance in the coaching classes, she will provide
scholarships to few students to support their tuition fees. She hopes her effort will
help at least few young women to pursue education without being forced into domestic labour.
For her, EmpowHER has exceeded her expectation. It has offered more than she had anticipated, helping her gain more clarity about her goals and herself.
Change maker #10:
Nisha Bhatt
Reap what you sow. Nisha Bhatt who is a second year Bachelor’s student of Social Science knows that to get good results you need to put in good effort. Passionate about
social change, she believes that a society can only be progressive when women are
given their basic rights without hesitance.
Through her ‘Impact Service Project’, she wants to create awareness about “Chaupadi”, an old tradition that banishes women during their menstruation forcing them to live in a sheds or outbuildings. They have limited food, poor sanitation, and are vulnerable to wild animal attacks and sexual harassments. Despite being
outlawed in 2005, many families in Western Nepal still practice this detrimental and life threatening tradition. She wants to pilot her project in Mashfal VDC in Dolpa, where many women have lost their lives to Chaupadi. With the help of her project, she will be providing awareness trainings in the community to help women overcome the social pressure to practice such traditions, and establish an understanding of menstruation as a biological process rather than a regressive social practice. She will also provide trainings on women health and how women can take care of themselves while they are menstruating. She hopes that her efforts will help the community gain a different perspective on women menstruation, leading to both behavioral and social change towards such practices.
She joined EmpowHER to empower herself so that she can enable other women in the community. Through EmpowHER she has been able to strengthen her interpersonal skills, better herself as a leader, and develop ever lasting sisterhood.
As the journey of EmpowHER progresses, we see the passion, focus, and the sense of responsibility towards the community brewing strongly in our participants. We are confident that these change makers will leave no stones unturned to make a powerful impact anywhere they go.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

105,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

106,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

107,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/trade-with-confidence/,"IT IS SEEN THAT TRADERS FOCUS ON RESULTS RATHER THAN PROCESS

KATHMANDU: Trade outcomes cannot be assured. The market might be predicted up to some level but its result is uncertain. You entered a market with full preparation to come out successful and it happened to be same as predicted but it can be the other way too; you entered a market with full study and analysis and relied on probabilities to come out successful but it had an unexpected outcome. The nature of trading is like that. Due to its nature and effect on the psyche of human being, it is essential to have a lot of self-confidence.
Self-confidence is an element which is required in every field to excel. Without this underlying competence, a person cannot grow and be ahead. It is rightly said that ‘Without confidence, we can do little in life. With it, we can change the world’. Confidence is a tool which when used in trading can have a positive impact and help to improve the performance thereon. Self-confidence in trading is the ability to focus on improvement and better performance thereby keeping self away from negative thought patterns like fear, greed, anxiety, et cetera.

Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade

Many traders have the misconception that winning trades develop confidence but the fact is just the opposite. More winning trades come from a dedicated focus on the process of trading where traders develop their skills and in doing so, develop their confidence. Focus on the process of trading is very important but very often, it is seen that traders focus on results rather than process. Soon if a trader sees a loss or two in a strategy they attempted, they will discard the strategy. This attitude leads only to frustration. So, in the phase of trading it is quite important to understand how we learn. Learning does not start at point A and steadily progress to point B; it is not a linear. Learning occurs in a series of ups and downs. We grow a little, fall back a bit, advance some more, take breaks and this is how it goes.
Other thing which leads to confidence development is positive thoughts. Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade. They don’t have a negative outlook. Rather they are quite optimistic and try to learn from their mistakes. It is said that positive outlook brings out positive result and the same applies to trading too. So instead of burdenning your mind with negative thoughts and wasting your time, be positive and think of how you can plan your trade better and follow it properly.
Develop self-confidence and you will see a better performance in your trade!

108,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/entrepreneur-juggler/,"“START SMALL, REALLY SMALL. TEST YOUR BUSINESS MODEL BEFORE YOU REACH OUT TO THE MASS.”

KATHMANDU: Amun Thapa, 27, owner/co-owner of five companies combined suggests that he is an ‘entrepreneur juggler’. When asked what it means, he states, “Someone who is constantly juggling between several ventures. At present, I manage Sasto Deal, Sasto Book, Irish Pub, Chhahari Production and Anthropose. A few other interesting projects are in the pipeline.”
Before asking him how he manages to look after all of these, I was curious to know where he started. Amun, I discovered, sees things in black and white without much grey areas. “For any problem, there are two approaches — to complain or to seek for solutions. I have always taken the latter approach. I never intended to become an entrepreneur. But the problems I personally faced in Nepal and elsewhere got me to come up with solutions, and hence the businesses I am involved with,” he shares. He says that getting where he is today was not an easy task. In his own words, “The first and foremost hurdle, when starting a business, is to understand the local legal and tax systems. Nepali entrepreneurs still do not have a clear understanding of how they should go about when it comes to taxation. It is a shame but also a reality that most businesses operate without proper registration and billings. This makes it difficult for other businesses to work. Also, finding the right employees is another major challenge here, apart from building culture.”
Amun shares that getting investment for a start-up in Nepal was a daunting task. He blames the regulations set by the Central Bank for Foreign Direct Investment and suggests that the easiest route is to seek for investment among friends and family. With profit margins depending on the venture/start-up, Amun says that the first year of the start-up, he did not care much about the profit margin but diverted their efforts in generating brand awareness. He shares, “This is when the advertisement costs are at their maximum. But to put it in numbers, a venture must seek at least 10 per cent to 40 per cent profit margin for it to be sustainable and scalable.”
On employees he says, “The smartest thing to do is ignore the resume because it tells nothing about an employee. We hire them on the basis of their performance during their internship period (which usually lasts for two months). Most of them come through referrals. We also have performance incentives to encourage employees to work at their level best. As for salaries, I believe everyone deserves to be paid well, like the saying goes — if you look after your employees, they will look after your clients.” He opines that he would definitely focus more on technology if he had the chance to start over again. “Over the past four years I have witnessed consumers adapting to changes in technology. People have taken to Facebook and Viber for communication, apps are replacing websites, and such. I was talking to a hotel owner in Pokhara yesterday and he told me, one of the first things people ask for after checking-in is the WiFi password.”
When asked about the Nepal’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, Amun says diversification is the key. “Nepal is now not only relying on tourism and hydropower and banking industries as income generating businesses but there are a lot more new industries that were introduced to the market in the past several years. Therefore, we are definitely on the right track.” His words of wisdom for the ones starting out are, “Start small, really small.
Test your business model before you reach out to the mass. Focus on building systems because this comes in handy when you are scaling your businesses. And always give priority to your brand because revenues can go up and down but your brand is what keeps you going.”

Altice expands in US with USD 17.7 billion Cablevision deal
European telecoms group Altice will become a major force in the lucrative US cable market after it agreed to buy fourth-largest operator Cable vision for a mix of cash and shares in a deal worth USD 17.7 billion including debt.
The move is the latest foray by French-Israeli billionaire and Altice founder Patrick Drahi, who built a telecoms and cable empire in recent years via debt-fueled acquisitions in France, Portugal and Israel.Drahi entered the United States in May by buying small regional cable group Suddenlink for USD 9.1 billion and had declared he would do more acquisitions so as eventually to earn half of Altice’s revenue there.
GM to pay USD 900 million settles US criminal case
General Motors Co (GM.N) has agreed to pay USD 900 million and sign a deferred-prosecution agreement to end a US government investigation into its handling of an ignition-switch defect linked to 124 deaths, two sources told Reuters. The deal means GM will be charged criminally with hiding the defect from regulators and in the process defrauding consumers, but the case will be put on hold while GM fulfills terms of the deal, one source said. No individuals would be charged in the criminal case, one of the sources said. The company’s expected USD 900 million payment, confirmed by a second source, is less than the USD 1.2 billion that Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) paid to resolve a similar case.

Global stocks at three-week highs as Fed decision looms
World stocks inched to a three-week high on Thursday while the dollar drifted lower against other currencies, as investors consolidated positions ahead of a nail-biting US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. There was a sense of relief as much as anything that after months of market speculation and advice from almost everyone from the IMF to the heads of the world’s top companies, that the wait for the Fed’s verdict would be over by 1800 GMT. Europe’s main share markets were left at a virtual standstill with Britain’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 all barely budged after two days of gains helped by a flurry of merger activity.Currency and bond market moves were low key too.
Wal-Mart worker group splits in two
A Wal-Mart Stores Inc worker group that has been one of the loudest voices pushing the retailer to boost wages and improve conditions has splintered over a disagreement about funding and strategic direction, according to people on both sides of the split. Both wings are claiming the name OUR Walmart and vow to continue their work, moves that could sow confusion among supporters.The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which for years has provided important funding and resources to the OUR Walmart worker group, will only financially support the wing that it believes represents the broader set of workers. “Recently we had a group split from us,” said Barbara Getz, who said she is head of the health and safety team for the OUR Walmart grouping that is sticking with UFCW.

AUSTRALIA

US Fed may not hike interest rates
The Australian share market has surged ahead of highly anticipated US Federal Reserve rates call, as energy stocks soar on a strong bounce in crude oil prices. Investors remain upbeat approaching the US Federal Reserve’s decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, with financial markets predicting a 30 per cent chance of lift-off. At the 4.15pm (AEST) official market close, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 added 47.9 points, or 0.94 per cent, to 5146.8 points, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 47.6 points, or 0.93 per cent, to 5171.2 points. The growing sense that the US Fed may not hike interest rates has also pushed the Australian dollar above US72c for the first time in three weeks as per The Australian.
Australian shares rose 1.5 per cent on Thursday for a second straight day of gains as all sectors rallied ahead of the US Fed’s interest rate decision later in the day. Banks and miners were among the clear winners with the “Big Four” lenders rising more than two percent in early trade. A jump in oil prices pushed energy stocks higher. The S&P/ASX 200 index added 73.83 points to 5,172.7 by 0215 GMT. The index closed 1.6 per cent higher on Wednesday, and is on track to post a second straight weekly gain. Analysts said the market could claw back some of the day’s gain as the near-month futures contract expires on Thursday and could add some volatility. Asian stocks hit a three-week high on Thursday after a jump in oil prices lifted Wall Street, with many investors taking last-minute positions ahead of the Fed’s policy decision.

BANGLADESH

Secretary of state for treasury ministry
According to The Daily Star, Poland is interested in investing in mining, coal extraction and installation of liquefied natural gas terminal in Bangladesh as the European country has experience in the sectors, a deputy minister said yesterday. Zdzislaw Gawlik, secretary of state for the treasury ministry, also said his country is keen to explore shell gas in Bangladesh. “We are bringing in very solid proposals of investment in Bangladesh,” he said. “I know Bangladesh is developing at a faster rate. So we are working at the government-to-government and business-to-business levels to intensify bilateral relationship.”
Tea prices in Bangladesh edged higher for a second straight week at the weekly auction on Tuesday amid tight supplies and strong demand for quality leaf. Bangladeshi tea fetched an average 187.93 taka (USD 2.4) per kg at the 19th auction of the current marketing season, slightly up from 185.81 taka at the previous week’s sale when the prices snapped seven-week losing streak, an executive with National Brokers said. There was huge demand for quality tea, while volume dropped again this week compared with last week, helping prices to perk up, the executive said. About 1.93 million kg was offered at the sole auction centre in Chittagong, of which 6.5 per cent was unsold. In the previous auction, about 10 per cent of the 2.17 million kg offered went unsold. The national budget for the 2015/16 fiscal year that started in July raised the regulatory duty on tea imports by five per cent to discourage overseas buying. Tea prices fell sharply in the last marketing season on poor demand from local buyers as business sentiment was hit by renewed political unrest early this year that left more than 120 people dead and disrupted supplies. The country, however, has moved from being a net exporter to a net importer of tea due to rising consumption.

CHINA

Activists rally ouside the White House
China’s economic powerhouse is slowing, destabilising global markets. Beijing’s neighbors, unnerved over its pursuit of territorial claims, are increasingly cosying up to Washington. A threat of US cyber sanctions looms over Chinese companies. It might seem an ideal time for US President Barack Obama to take advantage of Beijing’s troubles and get tough when he hosts Chinese leader Xi Jinping for a state visit on September 25. Obama is expected to press Xi on issues that have strained relations between the two countries, but his approach will be tempered because for better or worse the world’s two biggest economies are inextricably bound together. That will mean a difficult balancing act for Obama. He is under pressure to send a strong message to Xi over cyber spying, Chinese economic policies and South China Sea disputes, but he does not want to upend a summit that could set the tone for relations for his last 16 months in office.
Just as China shows that its domestic stock market can be something of a one-way street — investors can put money in, but not take money out — the biggest mutual fund company, Vanguard Group, is moving ahead with plans to expose more mom-and-pop investors to the country’s heavily restricted exchanges. With the Shanghai stock exchange down by 37 per cent and the Shenzhen exchange off by 43 per cent during the past three months, compared with just an 18 per cent drop on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, Vanguard is adding China mainland stocks to its USD 60 billion emerging markets fund in the coming year.Vanguard says adding A-shares — stocks that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, as opposed to those that trade on the Hong Kong exchange — will diversify the fund, but acknowledges they pose unique risks related to tracking a benchmark. Steps taken by the Chinese government to restrict trading on domestic exchanges make it difficult for index funds to buy the stocks they need to replicate the performance of Chinese benchmarks, fund executives said.

EUROPE

Nestle fails to convince European judges
According to The Guardian, Nestlé has failed in an attempt to convince European judges to let it trademark the shape of the four-finger version of a KitKat in the UK. The European court of justice ruled that the KitKat’s shape was not distinctive enough for consumers to associate it with the chocolate covered wafer. Nestlé is not seeking to trademark its two-fingered version of KitKat. Nestlé had argued that even without its red and white packaging or the word KitKat embossed on the chocolate, the shape of the bar should be regarded as distinct. The dispute between Nestlé and Cadbury, which has fought to prevent Nestlé securing a trademark, will go back to the UK high court for a final ruling that will determine whether rivals will be able to launch copycat KitKats in Britain.Despite the court’s failure to allow the trademark, Nestlé said it was pleased with the ruling.
International creditors expect the first review of Greek reforms under the latest bailout to start in October, bringing changes to a memorandum of understanding signed with Athens and paving the way for debt rescheduling talks, Euro Zone officials said. Euro Zone finance ministers will discuss preparations for Greek reforms envisaged by the third bailout, worth 86 billion euros (USD 96.8 billion), at an informal meeting in Luxembourg on Saturday. No implementation review is possible before Greece’s September 20 parliamentary elections. “There are elections in Greece. We have to wait for the results,” Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna, whose country holds the EU’s rotating presidency, told Reuters in an interview.

INDIA

Reserve Bank of India headquaters, Mumbai
India requires sustained low inflation and a credible programme for fiscal rectitude to lower the cost of capital, Urjit Patel, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said on Thursday, striking a hawkish note after government calls for interest rate cuts to boost the economy. The central banker also said in a speech to a business conference that he expected India’s current account deficit to be 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product in the 2015/16 fiscal year. New banking licences issued by the RBI were also aimed at lowering the cost of capital, Patel said. His remarks addressed concerns that commercial banks have failed to pass on recent cuts in the RBI’s main policy rate to their borrowers.
India plans to address some pending tax disputes in the next few days, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday, but did not give details or say whether the cases in question included disputes with foreign companies that have spooked investors. Earlier this month, the finance ministry decided not to press claims for a Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) against foreign portfolio investors. India remains locked in major back-tax battles with telecoms group Vodafone (VOD.L) and Cairn Energy (CNE.L). Arun Jaitley said last week that the government was trying to resolve pending tax cases, many of them outside the courts.

JAPAN

Workers are seen in a container area at a port
Japan’s exports slowed for a second straight month in August in a worrying sign that China’s economic slowdown could deal a damaging blow to the world’s third-biggest economy and force policymakers to inject fresh stimulus before too long. The data joins a string of depressing shipment numbers in key regional economies — including South Korea and Taiwan — which has heightened anxiety over a China-led slowdown in global growth and tempered bets of the US Federal Reserve lifting rates for the first time in almost a decade later on Thursday.Slowing exports could increase the chance of additional monetary easing from the Bank of Japan, because this could lead to lower factory output, slack economic activity and less momentum needed to offset deflationary pressure caused by a collapse in oil prices.
Vietnam agreed with Japan on Tuesday to step up security cooperation, becoming the latest Southeast Asian country to seek closer ties with Tokyo as China maintains an assertive posture in disputed waters in the South China Sea. The agreement between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Vietnam’s Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong comes after a US expert said on Monday China appeared to be carrying out preparatory work for a third airstrip in contested territory in the South China Sea. China has overlapping claims with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei in the South China Sea. It is also embroiled in a row with Japan over a group of East China Sea islets. Earlier this year, Japan reached an agreement with Malaysia and the Philippines to strengthen security ties.

Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Thursday ahead of a likely policy move by the US Federal Reserve, with stocks in Malaysia outperforming and Singapore hitting a more than one-week high as a big jump in global oil prices boosted energy stocks. Oil prices jumped as much as six per cent on Wednesday after a US stock draw. Oil bulls were also encouraged by doubts on whether the Fed will decide to hike US interest rates on Thursday after tame August inflation data. Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur composite index was up 2.1 per cent on a rally in oil-related stocks. The index touched 1,691.93, a near six-week high, on resuming trade after a market holiday. Shares of oil and gas services firm Sapurakencana Petroleum Bhd was up seven per cent and Tenaga Nasional Bhd was 2.3 per cent higher, among top gainers.
While Malaysia’s premier faces tough questions over the origin of hundreds of millions of dollars transferred to his bank accounts, the country has tentatively received good grades for its anti-money laundering efforts from a team of international experts, documents reviewed by Reuters show. A draft report by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body which monitors how countries fight illicit financial flows, said Malaysia had put in place a “robust policy framework” to combat money laundering.But it said the Asian country needed to be more effective in targeting high-risk offences and needs to pay more attention to transnational crime. The draft, dated Aug 4 and marked for official use, said the FATF inspection team found the Malaysian government had a “strong political commitment and well functioning coordination structures” to fight money laundering and that “significant resources have been allocated” to investigations in this field.

RUSSIA

Launch of new Opel Astra to boost sales
General Motors (GM.N) executives said they remained committed to meeting their goal of reaching profitability in Europe by 2016, brushing aside concerns that a downturn in Russia could put their goal at risk. “We are confident about reaching our goal,” Opel Chief Executive Karl-Thomas Neumann told journalists at the Frankfurt auto show on Tuesday. In July, GM warned its European employees the Opel and Vauxhall brands were still posting significant losses, and meeting its goal of returning to profit by next year would be difficult given the crisis in Russia and the Euro Zone. But General Motors President Dan Ammann said on Tuesday the launch of a new Opel Astra would help boost sales.
Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc on Tuesday said it expected to complete its new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a soon-to-be banned Russian engine, but the date could slip if it does not receive enough US government funding. Aerojet Vice President Julie Van Kleeck declined comment on reports that Aerojet has offered USD two billion to acquire United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 rocket launch venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Analysts say the bid is a strategic move by Aerojet to shut out rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, that is developing a new engine favored by ULA for use in its new Vulcan rocket. ULA has said Blue Origin’s engine programme is about two years ahead of Aerojet’s work on the AR-1 engine, a claim Aerojet disputes.Work on the new engines gained urgency after US lawmakers passed a ban on use of Russian RD-180 engines for launches of US military or spy satellites following Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine last year.

PAKISTAN

Pakistan and Afghanistan have shelved a raft of agreements that promised to more than triple cross-border trade, officials said, as economic ties seen as key to regional stability fall victim to rivalry and suspicion. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani struck the trade deals with Pakistan soon after taking office last year as part of a broader rapprochement that included plans to share intelligence on Taliban insurgents active in both countries. That cooperation was aimed at tackling the Islamist militant movement, which has separate Afghan and Pakistani branches whose violent campaigns kill thousands of people each year and hamper much-needed development. The trade deals were supposed to be a step towards warmer relations and boosting Afghanistan-Pakistan trade from USD 1.6 billion now to USD five billion by 2017. But officials told Reuters that the agreements, which include reducing tariffs and granting each other preferential trade status, have stalled.
Pakistani farmers will receive USD 3.2 billion in grants, subsidies and loan advances from the government, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced on Tuesday, in a bid to spur sluggish growth in one of the country’s main economic sectors. The new schemes represent the government’s largest economic development programme for the agricultural sector since it was voted into office in 2013.The funds will be provided through immediate cash grants and subsidies on agricultural inputs worth USD 1.4 billion, while loan advances worth USD 1.85 billion will also be made and disbursements begin this year, he said. “The conditions of the agricultural sector do not inspire confidence,” Sharif said as he announced the new package at a farmers’ convention in Islamabad. The package includes immediate cash grants for rice and cotton farmers, cuts in fertiliser prices, and a government scheme to pay insurance premiums for farmers who cannot afford them.

THAILAND

TAC plan expansion of it 4G mobile network
Thailand’s Total Access Communication Pcl (TAC) said on Thursday it is planning a major expansion of its fourth generation (4G) mobile network, as it seeks to displace rivals Advanced Info Service Pcl and True Corp. The country’s second largest mobile operator, controlled by Norway’s Telenor, has received regulatory approval to provide 4G services on the 1800MHz frequency band, which is currently used for 2G, Chief Executive Officer Lars Norling told a news conference. TAC also plans to increase its number of base stations to 32,000 in early 2016 from 17,000 now, aiming to provide 4G network coverage nationwide.
The Asian Development Bank will lower its 2015 GDP growth forecast for Thailand from the current 2.9 to 3.0 per cent following weaker-than-expected performance in the first half, the Bangkok Post reported, citing Luxamon Attapich, the bank’s senior economist for Thailand.The new growth forecast, due to be announced on Sept 22, will be higher than 2.5 per cent, the paper reported.

USA

A women walks past the FR headquaters
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has made clear she would rather delay an interest rate hike for too long than move sooner and risk jeopardising a tepid economic recovery, a conviction that will face its sharpest test yet on Thursday. Having weighed the economy’s steady march toward full employment against the backdrop of weak inflation and wage growth and turbulence overseas, the US central bank will issue its latest rate decision at the end of a two-day policy meeting. A rate hike would be the first in the United States in nearly a decade. Fed watchers, however, see the outcome as a toss-up, with Yellen’s consistently stated desire to see workers reap more benefits from the recovery, coupled with weak price rises and a variety of global risks, looming large. “It is a game-time decision. The key is what Yellen thinks and my guess is that she will want to wait,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. “If you put yourself in her shoes, you don’t want to make a mistake by going too soon.”
Oil prices were stable on Thursday as a US stock draw tightened the market while Asia’s economies showed new signs of weakness.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading at USD 47.13 per barrel at 0430 GMT, virtually unchanged from their previous close, while Brent was up 6 cents at USD 49.81 per barrel. That followed a price jump of as much as six per cent in the previous session when data from the US Energy Information Administration showed the largest crude drawdown since February 2014 at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point. Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures said that the stock draw was “a result of higher refining activity and lower US crude production which is helping the US inventory glut to ease off”.

110,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

111,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/weak-institutions-hit-economic-growth/,"Poor spending performance by public institutions a challenge for the economy
KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

KATHMANDU
Traders are simply investing their time, thinking that if they spend a lot of time around the markets, analysing charts, reading books and studying courses, their skill level will improve. Investing time is necessary when you are starting out, as there is a lot to learn. But putting in hours will not necessarily increase your profit potential. If you always repeat the same mistakes, putting in hours will just be meaningless with those habits in place. To improve, make repeated and deliberate choices. Here are five things to start doing today to improve your trading performance.
GET HELP
Trading is tough and not a cup of tea for everyone especially when we go at it completely alone. So choose a person who could be just a friend or family member who you have told your plans to and who you keep updated on your performance. Share what you are doing, what you are struggling with and what you are having success with. Anyone can get side tracked, so be open to being told when you have gone astray. When your own discipline and self-awareness fails, you will have someone to help you get back on track.
FOLLOW YOUR PLAN
Talking about strategies with other traders or discussing your performance with your trading referee is fine, but avoid the opinions of others when it comes to specific trades. Trade your trading plan, your way. It doesn’t matter if a trader you respect says they are going to buy when your plan says to sell.
PRACTICE
A strategy may seem simple on the surface, but even a simple strategy is hard to implement in live market conditions. Every day, every trend, every pullback is slightly different; nothing looks exactly the same as it did in the textbook examples. So trade it in a demoaccount until you consistently see profit from it.
MENTAL CLARITY
Each day take one minute before you trade to make sure you are feeling clearheaded and focused. Also take a couple of seconds to reiterate that you’re here to trade, not check your social media accounts, email or watch videos online. When you trade, simply focus on trading and leave other matters. Check the economic calendar to be aware of events that may move the market, so you are not taken by surprise during the day. If you are angry, upset or unfocused, avoid trading. It only takes one day, one trade even, to lose an entire account when not in the right mind frame.
RECORD YOUR TRADE
Review every trade you make. Take screenshots of your trades with entries, stop loss levels, targets, and your technical/fundamental notes so you can easily review your trades at a later time.

KATHMANDU
Hear it verbatim from Rajesh KC on how he aspires to build a world-class Nepali brand.
“I have been drawing cartoons since 1990s. Back then they were limited to my friend’s portraits but once I got the platform, I was able to polish my skills and dedicate my time and energy to the same. It has been 25 years now and I recently expanded the skills I have to something new.”
On Phalano Luga: “Phalano Luga came to me as a pleasant surprise. A friend of mine who owned a t-shirt store asked me to design a few prints for t-shirts. While designing, I thought to myself, ‘He might give me royalty and I might make some money out of the designs but why not create a Nepali brand in itself?’ I visited stores for market evaluation and realised that even though Nepal has a lot of talent in terms of designs, the fabric was not up to the mark. Even though the t-shirts had tags that said, ‘100 per cent cotton’, something was amiss. Phalano Luga came into existence with an ambition of creating a Nepali brand for Nepalis to wear. With the fabric imported from Ludhiana, India, and the manufacturing factory located in Patan, I have been able to give the market what I had in mind. The printing machines are imported from California and are top class and that is how I had imagined my brand to be — uncompromising and pocket-friendly.”
On growth: “Initially, I had a target of selling at least one t-shirt per day. I thought that the concept of a Nepali brand might take some time to build but I am surprised with the exponential growth Phalano Luga has seen. In the past two years, my dream of selling one t-shirt per day has topped 30 t-shirts per day.”
On workers: “This is one of the bigger challenges I face. Retaining workers and getting the best ones is a big challenge. A group of Nepali workers are coming back to Nepal from Malaysia to work with me. Apart from retaining them, paying them the same amount they used to earn overseas is a challenge. The people I am working with right now are also working with the production unit of Nike, Adidas, Peter England and other such global brands, based in Nepal. The problem is not the quality of the workers, but the economy and the quality of local materials available.”
On funds: “While starting the business off, my bank was skeptical about giving me a loan. My capital investment was close to one crore and after convincing the bank, I had 30 per cent of the costs covered. Most of the funds were drawn from my own pockets.”
On new ventures: “As of now, with more than satisfactory sales, I have the confidence of expanding my business across the country and abroad. But my first priority would be maintaining the quality for a while before dreaming big. Phalano Coffeeghar which is the latest addition to my business venture is something I am looking up to for now. With Phalano Luga doing well, I partnered with an old friend, Prem Aryal and opened the cafe last week. I had the space and he had the ideas, we got together and came up with the Coffeeghar plan. Like the tees, the eatables available at the cafe will all be Nepali-centric. Long term plans for this cafe are branded water bottles and sugar sachets.”
On the future: “I aspire to make Phalano Luga as big as Nike and Adidas.”

Kathmandu
With the country in dire need of post disaster economic recovery, it is expected that governing bodies address the concerns of major contributors to the GDP. The advertising industry is one such sector with the potential to help with economic recovery; and could provide a significant push towards an economic boom, just as the country needs it the most.
Advertising helps create successful businesses, which then lead to employment opportunities. Even media, the driving force behind growing economies, benefits from stability in the industry, as advertising is the chief source of revenue for mass media like newspapers, television, radio, print magazines and websites. Research has consistently shown that countries with larger investments in the advertising industry are more developed than other countries. For instance, the advertisement industry in the United States creates 18.2 million of the 126.7 million jobs. However, back home in Nepal, the predicament of the advertising industry is such that the government is yet to give due recognition to the industry.
According to the Advertising Association of Nepal (AAN), the total annual revenue of the advertising
industry is Rs 5.5 billion. While it is an industry with vast potential; it appears to lack order with various unresolved issues brimming under the surface.
The present scenario
Although at a very slow pace, the industry was witnessing growth before disaster struck. Post earthquake, the scenario looks far from encouraging. Is there a noticeable difference in the industry before and after the earthquake? Ranjit Acharya, CEO of Prisma Advertising says, “Before the earthquake, the industry was in its growing stage. Growth was rather slow but it was growing
nonetheless. Post earthquake, advertising agencies had to cut down on budgets, as it was the need of the hour. With no help from any quarter it was a necessity to cut down costs.” According to him, most businesses had to cut down on advertising budgets, which led to stagnancy in the industry. He says, “A person must seek medical help when ill and not cut down on medicinal costs. The same is with
advertisements.”
Deependra Tandon, Director of Business Advantage says, “In the first few months after the disaster in April/May we did not have any business. We have gradually recovered now and we hope that the business will revive in the festive season.” He adds that the business is still in its infancy and there is room for improvement.
Ahimsa Yonjan, Managing Partner at TBWA\Benchmark Nepal, says, “The earthquakes led to a rather disturbing slowdown for a month or two, but considering everything that has happened, the industry looks to have weathered the storm rather well”. He adds, “However, as an industry, we do not seem to have learned much from the experience, as there is actually very little difference in communication styles or brand behaviour before or after the earthquakes.”
The mushrooming of advertising agencies
AAN has 298 advertising agencies on its member roster, but there still exist several hundred more agencies that are not registered with the association. With so many advertising agencies operating in the market, it is still generally accepted that most of the advertisements that are produced in Nepal are not satisfactory. On this, Santosh Shrestha, President of AAN says, “Because there is no entry barrier to this industry, anyone can register and have an agency up and running in no time. While this opens a lot of doors for newcomers it leads to compromise on the quality. It becomes a tough job to monitor quality.” He further says, “The world of advertising is creative and fascinating. In Nepal, the industry has an estimated growth of 10 to 15 per cent annually. If we focus on quality control, nothing can stop this industry from growing in the coming years.”
Advertising agencies and advertisement standards
On the compromised quality of advertising and agencies not being up to the mark, Shrestha says, “The quality of advertisement depends of the level of awareness of the society, resources, budget and the economy. Advertisements reflect the attitude of the society. The market is small and the economy is not
progressive. The current focus is on production of effective advertisements rather than creative ones.”
He adds that they are responsible to cater to the mass with limited budget. He says, “Suppose there are three kids who study in grade three, six and eight. Now, all of them must be explained to in a similar manner, in a language they can comprehend. The teacher explains in the easiest way so that every one can understand. The same goes with advertisement.”
Joydeb Chackravarty, Managing Director, JWT – Thompson Nepal has a different view on this subject. He says, “Nepali consumers are exposed to creative advertisements, if not from within the country, but definitely from the world outside. They are intelligent and they know exactly what they want.
Advertisers should not underestimate their level of awareness and should not doubt their intelligence.”
He says that it is high time for the industry to push the envelope in terms of standards and creativity.
Yonjan says, “While I do agree that the overall quality of advertising could be a lot better, I think it is quite unfair to generalise and say that the quality of advertising agencies is not up to the mark. There are a few agencies doing good work locally, so we must give credit where it is due.” He further says, “As with any other industry however, a combination of many factors; such as, lack of industry knowledge and processes, timelines, an unwillingness to provide proper compensation on the side of all parties involved, leads to a large proportion of work being of poor quality. It is the same with art, music and movies. Much of what is produced is quite terrible, but there are those that stand out.”
The clean feed debate
For almost eight years now, AAN has lobbied with the government to introduce a Clean Feed Policy. This policy will ensure content filtering systems that can be used to block foreign commercials aired through foreign channels from reaching the Nepali audience. The main purpose of this policy will be to eliminate the trend of dubbing and encourage multinationals to produce and develop advertisements through local agencies.
Nirmal Raj Poudel, CEO of Welcome Advertising and Marketing, says, “Multinational companies dub foreign advertisements and broadcast them in local channels.  Further, the paid channels also include commercials. This results in quality compromise.”
However, some industrialists claim that clean feed is an uphill task in Nepal. They argue that competition will be killed with the introduction of this policy. A Clean Feed Committee has meanwhile been formed by AAN that has been doing research on the topic and is under dialogue with the government for a quick implementation of this policy.
The right way of doing things
According to some, one of the biggest challenges the industry currently faces is the lack of vision and leadership within the industry. Only self- regulation and quality checks can turn the industry around. Tandon says, “The change must start with the industry itself. Introducing policies is not enough for the development of the industry.” Yonjan has similar views, he says, “We cannot introduce laws to control or fix what are inherently industry problems. What is more necessary is an independent regulatory body that can develop and enforce a code of conduct/best practice model in place for the overall advertising market.”
Although the advertising industry is currently facing an uphill battle, this is still an industry that has enormous potential. With the industry only just beginning to mature, and mediums like digital and new age media opening up, there appears to be much to look forward to for the industry. For the rest of us, it remains the industry to watch.
In parting, it is perhaps Chakravarty who sums it up best — “The next five years are going to be challenging for the advertising industry in Nepal. However, if we follow the right way of doing things and remain honest and integrated there are chances that we can recover soon.”

The monsoon struck the village mid-June, but officials of Sangachowk VDC are still struggling to distribute cash relief to villagers.
Currently, the villagers are living inside temporary shelters made from rusted zinc sheets riddled with holes and timber salvaged from their damaged houses. They kept some zinc sheets and timber to shelter their cattle and poultry after distribution of relief amount was delayed.
Shyam Khadka, 55, of Pokhre said,”The rain water trickles through the zinc sheets. The families of my three sons are housed under one small temporary shelter. Even if the government distributes relief money it will not be sufficient to procure zinc sheets to construct temporary shelters that will accommodate the families of my three sons.”
Basanta Prasad Ghimire, secretary, Sangachowk VDC said cash relief had not been distributed as the registered households claiming cash relief outnumbered the actual damaged households.
“Over 28,000 households have registered for cash relief, whereas, the District Administration Office has allocated cash relief for only 22,000 households on the basis of existing documented records before the earthquake of April 25,” he said.
The government had announced immediate cash relief of Rs 15,000 for one damaged house. The joint families who have not legally divided properties are not eligible for immediate cash relief even if they had been staying in separate houses.
“The joint families who lost more than one house registered fore cash relief under names of different members of the same family,” Ghimire said, stressing that families who had lost more than one house are not satisfied with government policy.
He warned that a monitoring team comprising ward citizens’ forum would be deployed to find such joint families who had registered more than once for the same house before issuing the ID card to claim immediate cash relief and Rs 200,000 to further build a permanent house.
The government released Rs 5.53 billion to the local authorities for immediate relief countrywide in May.
According to District Disaster Relief Committee, the death toll was 3,656 in Sindhupalchowk. About 90 per cent of houses in the district were razed to the ground.

116,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/duplication-in-tax-headings-draws-flak/,"KATHMANDU: The draft of the new constitution has overlooked the concerns related to effective levying of major taxes and duplicated some tax headings in central and state governments, as well as provincial and local governments.
Such duplications might pose a threat to the revenue system once the country adopts a federal structure due to disputes of power allocation between central and provincial government to levy taxes, according to tax experts.
The draft constitution has proposed that excise and individual income tax can be levied by both the central and provincial governments. Similarly, it has also proposed that many other tax headings be levied by the provincial and local governments, like registration tax, vehicle tax and tourist fee.
“Even as related Acts will have to be formulated, the power allocation in the central, provincial and local governments will result in disputes when the laws related to taxes are enforced in the coming days,” opined Rup Khadka, tax expert and the chair of the government-formed High Level Tax System Review Commission. The draft constitution has extended authority to levy taxes, but it is silent on power allocation regarding enforcement, like what portion of the excise duty and IIT can be levied by the province and the portion of the registration and vehicle and land tax that can be levied by the local government.
Giving an example of South Sudan, Khadka said, “The taxes proposed to be levied by the central government were also placed in the domain of provincial government, which led to a dispute. It was later sorted out by forming a task force under the chairmanship of the finance minister of the centre, comprising finance ministers of provinces.”
According to him, it would be better to extend the authority to levy a certain tax to a particular government that can effectively levy that duty. “That power can be shared among other governments.”
The HLTSRC has suggested the finance committee of the Parliament to put customs, VAT, excise, corporate and individual income tax under the domain of the central government for effective enforcement, as these taxes are of stra-tegic importance and strong institutional mechanism is required to levy them effectively. Likewise, registration tax and vehicle tax have been recommended to be levied by provincial government.
Who is to levy what
Central government: Customs, excise, value added tax, corporate income tax, individual income tax, passport fee, visa fee, penalties and royalty of natural resources Provincial government: Wage tax (which covers large portion of individual income tax), land tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, excise, entertainment tax, advertisement tax, tourist fees, agriculture income tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources
Local government: Land and rent tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, service fees, tourist fees, business tax, entertainment tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources

117,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/development-bond-yields-fall-to-all-time-low/,"KATHMANDU: Yield on development bonds, regardless of their maturity period, has fallen to an all-time low, dampening sentiment of bankers, who have to tap the government securities market to meet some of the regulatory requirements.
Return on 15-year development bonds floated today by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) dropped to 2.65 per cent, the lowest since February 1964, when the government first introduced development bonds with a maturity period of five years to raise debt from the domestic market to finance development activities.
Surprisingly, returns on these securities are falling lately even as their maturity period is increasing.
When NRB auctioned five-year development bonds on May 28, the weighted average cut-off rate stood at four per cent. Then on June 4, when it floated seven-year development bonds, the return fell to 3.44 per cent.
The yield further dropped to 3.08 per cent when NRB offered nine-year development bonds on June 11.
The freefall continued on June 25 as well, when 10-year development bonds were floated. At that time, the weighted average interest rate had dropped to 2.99 per cent.
Considering 7.1 per cent inflation of mid-May, returns on these securities are negative in real term.
“Yields on bonds are falling rapidly because of excess liquidity in the banking sector,” Nara Bahadur Thapa, chief of Public Debt Management Department at NRB told The Himalayan Times.
Banks and financial institutions (BFIs) are currently sitting on excess liquidity of over Rs 70 billion. However, a large chunk of this money cannot be extended as loans because it is being used to meet the minimum regulatory net liquid asset to total deposit ratio, or LD ratio, of 20 per cent.
So, BFIs are rushing to grab these low-yielding securities assuming it is wiser to invest funds in bonds and get some returns rather than let them sit in coffers and generate no return.
Lately, what also appears to have exerted pressure on yields is the government’s decision to repay a part of debt.
So far this fiscal, the government has repaid Rs 42.55 billion of debt, including principal, shows the latest NRB report.
On the other hand, fresh government securities worth only Rs 42.34 billion have been floated in the market. This means net borrowing of the government stood at a negative of around Rs 211 million.
“Because of this, BFIs are rushing to replenish their stock of government securities to maintain LD ratio. This is raising the demand for bonds,” Thapa said, adding, “This is another reason for fall in bond returns.”
The falling bond return is, in fact, good news for the government, as it is now able to raise domestic debt at low interest rates. This means the cost of rebuilding parts of the country ravaged by the earthquake would be a little cheaper.
But bankers say this is creating ‘distortions’ in the market.
“Many BFIs that have purchased low-yielding instruments are now carrying a lot of market risk,” said Sashin Joshi, CEO of Nabil Bank.
This is because purchase of nine-, 10- and 15-year bonds is not a short-term investment, according to Joshi.
“And if returns on bonds rise next year, the instruments bought this year will turn into nothing but loss-making tools. At that time, many BFIs will have no option but to sell those instruments at a discount. This may hit their profitability as well,” Joshi added.

KATHMANDU: There is now little doubt that Pashupati Murarka, officiating president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), will take the helm of the largest private sector umbrella body tomorrow.
Murarka taking the lead of FNCCI has become a certainty after the two other contenders — Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar and Bhawani Rana — withdrew their candidacy for the post of FNCCI president from the election slated for tomorrow.
Organising a press meet on Tuesday, Rajkarnikar had announced his willingness to withdraw his candidacy and support Murarka if Rana also did the same. After Rana formally withdrew her candidacy yesterday, Rajkarnikar also formally pulled out his application today.
So, Murarka is the sole contender for the top post of FNCCI and will be announced as the unanimous president tomorrow. It also means that the post of senior vice president, which Murarka held before he took on the role of officiating chief of FNCCI, will be vacant.
Murarka had been appointed as the officiating president after its past president Pradeep Jung Pandey was arrested in a three-decade old corruption charge on March 18.
As per the FNCCI statute, election of the senior vice president should be done within five days of the president’s election. The senior vice president is elected from the executive committee, though the rest of the posts are filled through direct election.
According to FNCCI sources, there is general consensus among FNCCI members to select Bhawani Rana for the post of senior vice president. Leaders of the largest private sector umbrella body have claimed that rifts and groupism that occurred during the past elections will be bridged after the selection of a unanimous chief at FNCCI.

Nepal is hosting the Donors’ Conference for the reconstruction of the country in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes.
“Media reports that there was clash between us and there was lack of coordination while sending invitations to neighbouring countries are baseless. The finance minister and I were supposed to go to India and China respectively. But, I cancelled my visit to China after Chinese authorities informed us that Chinese foreign minister will not be able to participate in the conference due to prior engagement,” Pandey told the meeting of
National Disaster Management and Monitoring Special Committee of the Legislature Parliament headed by Speaker Subas Chandra Nembang today.
Finance Minister Mahat said that his ministry had prepared the 300-page Post Disaster Need Assessment, with the help of more than 200 experts divided into 23 sub-panels by working round the clock in view of the conference. “This is the official document of the government detailing the damage and need assessment. This document has created the base to see support from donor countries and inter-country agencies,” Mahat said.
The government has invited 65 countries and inter-governmental agencies, said Finance Mahat, adding: “Of them, 125 delegates of 40 countries and agencies have already expressed their commitment to participate in the conference”. Seven minister-level participants have sent their confirmation to participate in the conference, according to Mahat.
“Initially, donor countries wished to delay the conference to August-September. Citing the devastating earthquake situation, they proposed to hold the conference in New Delhi of India, Tokyo of Japan and Paris of France. They were reluctant to participate in the conference expressing their doubt over the safety of the participants as the situation had not been normal. However, we persistently stood on our stance of holding the conference in Kathmandu and made all arrangements for their safe living during their stay here. Ultimately, the donors were convinced and are expressing their commitment for their participation,” Mahat said.
Mahat said that the government would focus on foreign grant collection, sharing experiences of managing post-disaster situation and solidarity of friendly nations to Nepal’s crisis.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Pandey said that the government wanted to show the international community that the country was safe for tourism and it maintained complete harmony during the national crisis despite having around 125 different communities.
Mahat, responding to a complaint that Russian ambassador in Kathmandu did not get invitation till last Wednesday due to the government’s carelessness, said, “The government, six weeks ago, had emailed all the embassies and ambassadors in Kathmandu, making preliminary request to participate in the conference. The [Russian] ambassador had replied us via email that the country’s representative would not be able to participate in the conference due to pre-scheduled engagement on the conference day. Then, we did not send invitation to him. But, after we heard about the complaint, we have sent an invitation recently.”
Lawmakers including CPN-UML’s Madhav Kumar Nepal, Nepali Congress’s Ramchandra Paudel and Unified CPN-Maoist’s Girirajmani Pokharel, had urged the ministries to clarify the controversies related to the conference and suggested them to make the conference a success.
After listening to the two ministers, panel Chair Nembang instructed the government to take the neighboring countries and donors into confidence and also consultations with all the parties and take their feedback. Nembang also instructed the government to make an arrangement for making the foreign delegates observe the major tourist areas — both damaged and not damaged — independently during their visit to give a message that Nepal is safe for foreign tourists.

The ordinance will now be sent to the President for certification.
The Authority, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister, is being set up prior to the international donors’ conference, scheduled for June 25, which aims at seeking support from the international communities to rebuild Nepal.
When the ordinance is certified, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala will nominate four ministers and three experts as members of the high-level body, according to Minister for General Administration Lalbabu Pandit.
Likewise, Vice-Chairperson of the National Planning Commission and Chief Secretary will be members of the Authority.
The post-earthquake Reconstruction Authority will have a chief executive officer also. It will oversee all reconstruction works in the earthquake-hit districts where physical infrastructures have been damaged.
Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam informed that there will be a separate committee of foreign consultants that would be constantly supporting the Authority in its job.
According to the government’s assessment, the tremors caused damage worth Rs 513.38 billion to physical infrastructure and assets, and inflicted income loss of another Rs 187.08 billion.

According to District Police Office Bajura Chief DSP Uddhav Singh Bhat, the bodies are kept at Kolti Primary Health Centre for post-mortem.
“There are five doctors here, but as neither the administration nor the police told us anything earlier, we didn’t send any doctor there to conduct autopsy,” said District Hospital Bajura Chief Dr Rupandra Bishwokarma, adding that a doctor will head to the health centre tomorrow. “As we were approached today and told that we should send a doctor to conduct the autopsy, we’re now preparing to send a doctor,” he explained.

Ex-British Gurkhas Satyagraha Joint Struggle Committee today threatened to obstruct Gurkha recruitment possess scheduled for next week in Pokhara to exert pressure on the Government of Nepal and the Government of the United Kingdom to address its long-standing demands.
A press release issued by Krishna Bahadur Rai, chief coordinator of the committee warned that they were also going to launch serious of pressure campaigns in Nepal and the UK, simultaneously. “Issues raised by ex-Gurkhas are not just related to the retired servicemen, but to Nepal and all Nepalis. They are also related with dignity of the nation. We will continue our protest until both the governments form a high-level talks team and hold dialogue to address the demands of ex-Gurkha servicemen,” he said.
It has served an ultimatum until 15 February 2020 to the Government of Nepal and the Government of the UK to form a high-level talks team. The committee said a prompt dialogue between the two governments on the Report of Technical Committee that comprised the ambassador of Nepal to UK, minister of defence (UK) and representatives of British Gurkha ex-servicemen’s associations, has to be started without further delay. The dialogue should be held in line with the report of the International Relation Committee of the Federal parliament of Nepal as guiding instrument, said the press release.
According to the committee, imposition of Indian Pay Code on British Gurkhas after 1948, which came in the name of Tripartite Agreement-1947, but with mutual understanding between India and Britain, was unfair and against the national sovereignty and independence of Nepal.
It also warned that the movement of equality and dignity spearheaded by Gurkha veterans against the British government would be advanced at national as well as international level in the form of patriotic movement and a campaign dedicated to human rights and dignity of Nepali people. The ex-Gurkhas have demanded an end to discrimination and injustice imposed on Gurkha veterans and on their families and pay compensation to the families of thousands of soldiers who had lost their lives in wars.

128,https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/envoy-hou-terms-china-india-plus-trilateral-cooperation/,"Kathmandu, January 3
Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi today said the China-India Plus (or ‘Two plus one’) concept of cooperation mooted by Beijing essentially meant trilateral cooperation.
Speaking at a press briefing this morning, Hou said the concept did not deem Nepal as a very small country but China and India would play leading roles.
“Actually that implies trilateral cooperation. The trilateral cooperation will be a win-win cooperation,” she said, adding such cooperation with Nepal would move ahead as per the demand and proposal of the Nepali side.
“There will be trilateral cooperation among the countries.”
The ambassador added that such kind of trilateral cooperation could be forged in the areas of infrastructure, telecommunications and training courses, among others.
The leaders of ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP), including Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, are against the China-India Plus concept reportedly agreed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian PM Narendra Modi during Wuhan Summit on April 27-28, 2018. It was reported China was interested in further enhancing India-China Plus concept to develop a common strategy for Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Africa.
The concept also featured in the talks when Chinese President Xi visited Nepal in October last year.
The Nepali leaders are of the view that such concept suggests that China and India will have bigger roles and Nepal will have little role under ‘Two plus one’ cooperation model. In this backdrop, Hou said China had already built partnership with India and the US in relation to Afghanistan. “That is very simple, not very complicated one,” she said.
As far as the ongoing debate on the Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact Programme is concerned, Hou said Nepal as a least-developed country needed international support and assistance, not only from China, but also from other countries.“We welcome any kind of assistance to Nepal if it is in the area of economic cooperation,” she said, adding, Nepal could decide on its own without any external intervention.
“Economic cooperation should be forged equally and should benefit the Nepali people and promote Nepal’s national interests. We believe the Nepali government can take a positive decision as per the interest of Nepal.”
On recent arrests of more than 120 Chinese nationals in Nepal, the ambassador said the Chinese authorities had communicated with their Nepali counterparts after they found the individuals’ involvement in cyber crime. Stating that the arrestees were still in custody of Nepal Police, Hou said the Chinese government would protect legal rights of its citizens abroad, but not of those involved in illegal activities.
When asked whether China had any security concerns in Nepal, the ambassador said such concerns were the matters of common interests. Stating that the Nepal-China border has remained peaceful for long, she said some western countries did not like to see a stable and secure China, and good Nepal-China relations.
“I think this is a matter of concern for both the countries,” she said, adding, “Since Nepal and China are trusted neighbours, no outside force can intervene in the close relations between the two countries. “So the common concern is to make ourselves very stable, defend our sovereignty and territory, and safeguard international justice and law and order.”

Police at Tribhuvan International Airport arrested two Indian nationals with two kilograms of undeclared gold concealed in their rectums today.
Police said Bharat Suresh Lal, 31, and Navin Gopi Chand, 39, of Maharashtra, India, had arrived at TIA from Dubai on an Air Arabia flight.
Officials said the Indian duo were held for further investigation after being spotted behaving suspiciously and walking in a peculiar way during security check at the arrival gate. During interrogation they admitted to concealing gold in their rectums. Police took help of doctors at Sinamangal-based KMC Hospital to remove the contraband from the rectal cavity through medical procedures.
Lal and Chand had three pieces of gold of cylindrical shape weighing one kg each, in their rectums. According to police, they were trying to smuggle the gold by evading customs. They have been handed over to TIA Customs Office for further action. Police had arrested two Indian nationals in possession of 1.6 kg gold from TIA yesterday. On December 31, an Indian national was held with 500 grams of undeclared gold concealed in his rectum. A Chinese national was arrested with one kg gold being smuggled to Nepal by adopting the same modus operandi on November 29.
Despite police action, racketeers continue attempts to smuggle gold through the only international airport of the country. According to Nepal Police, security and customs officials are on high alert to arrest gold smugglers. Concealing gold in rectum, mouth, battery box, laptop, baggage, air-filter of vehicle, cargo trucks and inner sole of shoes are some of the major modus operandi adopted by smugglers. Smugglers also mould gold into jewellery and wear them to outsmart the security officials. Racketeers have been using returnee Nepali migrant workers to smuggle gold in recent times. Migrant workers are paid by the racketeers from the Gulf via wire after the consignment of gold is received by the concerned person in Nepal. Police said they had seized 108 kilograms of gold in fiscal 2018-19 compared to 72 kilograms in the previous fiscal.

Child marriages are rampant in the country undermining the rights of children. Studies by national and international non-governmental organisations and government reports indicate that social evil shows no sign of abating, despite stringent legal provisions.
According to the Status of Children in Nepal-2019, released by the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens, as many as 137 cases of child marriage were reported in 2018-19 compared to 136 in the previous fiscal.
A total of 196 children (59 boys and 137 girl) were victims of child marriage in 2018-19 against 168 (32 boys and 136 girls) in previous fiscal. In 2018-19, both the brides and bridegrooms of 59 cases of child marriage involved children. In a few cases, minor girls were married off to elderly men above the age of 60.
Of 196 children, who were married, 75 were subjected to pressure from their parents, while 121 others allegedly tied the knot on their own accord, according to the government report. The report also said Nepal Police and local child clubs foiled 24 cases of child marriage in 2018-19. As per the existing law, child marriage is referred to as a marriage entered into by a male or a female before attaining the age of 20 years.
Before the age of 18, girls are neither physically nor emotionally ready to become wives or mothers. The report said child marriage not only deprived girls of education, but it often made them vulnerable to a cycle of discrimination, domestic violence and abuse. It has advised children to make their parents aware that an individual must attain at least 20 years of age to get married. Section 173 of the Criminal Code Act states that anyone found guilty of committing or assisting child marriage shall be liable to a jail term not exceeding three years and a fine of up to Rs 30,000.
The MoWCSC said it had issued a procedure for carrying out programmes at local levels to eliminate social anomalies and malpractices like child marriage. The procedure aims to incorporate anti-child marriage programmes into periodic and  annual plans and programmes of the local levels and implement the same in an effective manner; ensure the participation of male children, teenagers and men in the fight against child marriage; and mobilise children, teenagers, parents, guardians, teachers, political and religious leaders and other stakeholders.
The programmes to be conducted by the local levels include raising awareness on child rights, sexuality, sexual and reproductive health and rights, through anti-child marriage campaign; training for child clubs and communities; development of child-friendly infrastructure; formation and mobilisation of child and youth clubs exclusively against such social malpractice; conducting awareness programmes at family level in association with government and non-government organisations; and ending child marriage and gender discrimination.

Addressing a press conference organised at his chamber here today, CJ Rana, who completed his first year as the chief of the judiciary, said the SC had set a precedent in the case stating that there should be a perfect balance among citizen’s interests, government’s desire to achieve the goals of development and development projects.
In response to a journalist’s query, the CJ said that the judiciary had the obligation to protect citizens’ rights guaranteed by the constitution.
He said the proposal to recommend former judicial council member Padam Prasad Baidik for a SC justice was put on hold as the Nepal Bar Association protested the proposal to nominate him in the post. CJ Rana said he was committed to adjudicating old cases without further delay and expedite the process to prepare full texts of verdicts. He said some of the corruption cases had not been adjudicated mainly because there was Yubaraj Sharma’s case   sub-judice at the full bench of the justices and once the case was adjudicated, that could set precedent, which would apply in many disproportionate asset cases.
He said the Judicial Council had taken action against the judges found guilty of violating code of conduct. Rana also said his administration monitored courts and took actions or served warning letters to 70 court officials or middlemen within a year.  He said the SC had within a year adjudicated 1,302 cases that were pending for more than five years. Currently the SC has over 1,886 cases pending for five years.
He said he was considering to extend case hearing for more than regular work hours, in an attempt to increase the case disposal rate.
Rana said his administration was preparing to introduce court room technology so that lawyers representing a case could attend the court proceedings through audio-visual mode of communication. The SC will also introduce digital archive of cases. Rana said he had been trying to bring reforms in the judiciary as per his plan presented during his parliamentary hearing.

Kathmandu University’s School of Science and School of Engineering in Dhulikhel and all of varsity’s deans’ offices have been padlocked since yesterday.
Teachers and employees have padlocked the departments and deans’ offices demanding that the agreement signed with them by the KU management more than a year ago be implemented at the earliest. Deans’ offices at School of Law, School of Management, School of Arts, School of Education and School of Medical Sciences have been padlocked. The agitators have also padlocked Office of the Examination Controller and all administrative offices of the university.
This is the first time that the classes of the university have been hampered due to protest by its teachers and staffers. University’s teachers, including lectures, assistant professors and professors and staffers have been demanding for long that the KU management formally grant recognition to their associations Kathmandu University Professors’ Association and Kathmandu University Staff Association.
Granting recognition is one of the four demands that the KU’s executive council, on August 30 last year, had agreed to fulfil. Other three demands include allowing KUPA’s president to attend the university’s executive council meeting, ensuring transparency in administrative work of the university and developing mechanism to guarantee career growth of teachers and employees at the university.
KUPA said the university management was forced to reach an agreement with it last August, after years of peaceful protests, but even after signing written agreement to fulfil the demands, the management had not been serious in implementing it.
Yesterday, the management had mobilised police to control agitating employees outside the university’s School of Medical Sciences. KU management said they had to call police after protesters created unhealthy environment at Dhulikhel Hospital, which is also a teaching hospital of KU.
KUPA said there were above 550 teachers working at KU and more than 75 per cent teachers and staffers had joined the protest. Bed Mani Dahal, president of KUPA, said they had been requesting the management to grant recognition to their associations for the last five years, but it had always been ignoring their requests.
KU management had agreed to form KU’s Faculty Welfare Council and KU Staff Welfare Council, instead of granting recognition to the associations. Welfare Council did not function well as the management formed such councils only at the School of Management and the School of Medical Sciences. “Welfare councils were mere show-piece formed by the management for its benefit,” said a KUPA source. KUPA said they wanted the KU management to give recognition to their association for the welfare of teachers and staffers working at the university.
Hem Raj Kafle, KU’s Information officer said the demands of agitating party could be met only by KU’s senate. “The senate is chaired by the chancellor (prime minister). The senate also requires presence of education minister and vice-chancellor, which is not an easy task as the university only holds two senate meetings in a year,” added Kafle. Kafle said protests would not bring any solution to the problem and urged the agitating teachers and staffers to resolve the problem through dialogue.

142,https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/nepali-congress-calls-for-revision-of-controversial-it-bill/,"KATHMANDU: Main opposition party Nepali Congress has asked that the government revise the much controversial IT Bill which according to many looks to restrict Freedom of Expression under the garb of regulating activities on cyberspace.
The Development and Technology Committee of the House of Representatives had passed the Information Technology Bill on December 29, ignoring the opposition of Nepali Congress lawmakers in the panel.
NC on Wednesday issued a statement calling for the correction of certain provisions on the bill which could curtail citizens’ right to freedom of opinion and expression under the pretext of regulating use of the internet. The opposition party condemned the government’s step toward limiting freedom of expression, deeming it unconstitutional, while urging the concerned sides to speak in defense of people’s basic rights.
What is the IT bill all about:

The said bill proposes severe penalty for offence against state and computer hacking.
It provisions a fine not exceeding  Rs 1.5 million or a jail term not exceeding five years, or both, for posting content on social networking sites that may pose a threat to the country’s sovereignty, security, unity or harmony.
A fine of up to Rs 50,000 or six months jail term or both on those found guilty of cyberbullying.
The original bill had proposed to punish people guilty of cyber bullying with a fine not exceeding Rs 1 million or jail term not exceeding five years or both.
For those responsible for deleting or interfering with information stored in somebody’s computer, the committee proposed to increase the jail term from one year to three years.
The bill makes it mandatory for social networking sites to register with the Department of Information.

Experts are of the opinion that the bill would give an unfair advantage to the government to silence those who used social networking sites to express their dissatisfaction.

Kathmandu, January 1
The government lacks immediate plan to address health issues of tourists visiting the country in 2020. It also doesn’t seem to be concerned about diseases the tourists might bring in with them.
The Ministry of Health and Population has been discussing measures to help the tourists visiting the country. “We are holding discussion on how to make tourists’ stay in Nepal safer and healthier. We are discussing to make focal units for emergencies. Also talks have been held on establishing units at hospitals to help tourists seeking medical help,” said Dr Bikash Devkota division chief, Policy Planning and Monitoring Division at MoHP. Tourists can encounter several health problems during their stay in the country. As there is a geographical variation in the country many tourists are likely to suffer from altitude sickness.
“Tourists can even suffer from altitude sickness in places like Nagarkot. Therefore, the government needs to provide them with information of altitude sickness at the immigration counters upon their arrival,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director of Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.
Also tourists are likely to suffer from food and water borne diseases in Nepal.
“When people consume contaminated food and water they will suffer from diarrhoea and other similar diseases. There should be a provision of quality food and water for all. There is also high risk for the tourists to suffer from injuries. Proper health service should be provided for the tourists immediately, when they fall sick,” added Dr Marasini.
When a large number of tourists visits the country there are high chances that they may also bring in diseases of various kinds. There should be proper screening of the tourists at the health desks of the immigration counters,” said Dr Marasini. “Tourists may bring with them Middle East respiratory syndrome, coronavirus and Ebola.
“After February there is risk of influenza in the country.
Therefore the government should be aware of all these aspects,” added Dr Marasini. Risk of water and food borne illnesses increase with rise in temperature which usually begins in March-April.
The government should make plans to prevent communicable diseases, according to Dr Marasini. Proper screening of the tourists should be done at the immigration. “The ministry has made plans to make the health desk at the immigration well equipped and we are planning to screen suspected travellers,” said Dr Devkota.
It will take at least one more month to come up with concrete health plans for the visitors, according a source at the ministry.

Police have arrested six persons for their alleged involvement in forgery racket of printing huge cache of counterfeit government documents.
Police confiscated fake documents from New Road-based Photo Concern, one of the oldest photo studios in the country. Seized fake documents include smart driving licences, Nepali citizenship certificates, government employees’ identity cards and identity cards of Armed Police Force.
Those arrested have been identified as Deepak Blon, 27, of Lalbandi and Buddhi Bahadur Rokka aka Subhas, 48, of Hariwon in Sarlahi, Ananta Gurung, 31, of Bouddha, Ashok Karki, 31, of Simara in Bara, Mohan Yadav, 41, in Sukhipur of Siraha and Kumar Tandukar, 56, of Lazimpat. Some of them worked as photographer, sales officer, printer and cashier of the photo studio.
Police got a hint of the illegal racket as Blon produced a fake driving license to the traffic police after breaking traffic rule yesterday at Putalisadak. Suspecting that the license was duplicate, traffic police had sought the help of Nepal Police, leading to his arrest. During interrogation Blon said that a man named Buddhi Bahadur Rokka had provided him the license for Rs 30,000.
Rokka, who operates a graphic designing centre at Teku, had after designing the driving license, taken it to Photo Concern to get it printed. Senior Superintendent of Police Hridaya Thapa of Metropolitan Crime Division said Rokka provided information that Photo Concern was involved in printing illegal documents.
Police raided the photo studio and seized huge cache of fake documents.
Some of them were Aadhar cards issued by the government of India, duplicate identity cards of security agencies of Nepal government and employees of Nepal government and identity cards of dozens of private schools and colleges.
SP Thapa said although a few fake driving licenses were seized during the raid, large numbers of such documents could have been circulated in the market. “Traffic police have been warned about it. We will arrest anybody if found using duplicate cards.”
All the arrested persons have been charged with offense related to fake documents, which as per the existing rules, can put the offenders for up to seven years behind bars, with fine imposed up to Rs 70,000, each.

The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority has detained former chief district officer of Dolakha Khagendra Prasad Rijal for investigating his alleged involvement in bribery and corruption.
Joint Secretary Pradip Kumar Koirala, CIAA spokesperson said Rijal, was taken into custody yesterday. On December 10, the Ministry of Home Affairs had relieved him of all his responsibilities on the recommendation of the anti-graft body.
As per the CIAA Act-1991, in case there exists reasonable ground to believe that the public post holder, against whom an action has been initiated on charges of corruption, may conceal or destroy evidence against him/her, or hamper or obstruct inquiry and investigation, the anti-graft body may write to the concerned government agency to suspend him/her from the post.
The CIAA had investigated Rijal’s involvement in settlement of cases under the jurisdiction of his office, in which he received bribe from crime suspects and released them on bail. The CIAA has also taken into account news published or broadcast through various media as the base for its investigation.
It was revealed that Rijal had sought a bail of Rs 100,000 from Kumar Lama Moktan of Melung Rural Municipality-4, Dolakha in a public offence case last week, but issued him a receipt of only Rs 10,000, keeping the rest of the amount with himself. The financial irregularity came to light when Lama exposed the receipt to media in Rijal’s presence on December 5.
Dolakha District Police Office had arrested Lama under a public offence case, 24 days ago.
Following a trial hearing, Lama’s wife Renu Tamang had handed 100,000 rupees to the CDO to secure Lama’s release but had got a receipt of only 10,000 rupees. When she reached the CDO’s office to inquire about the remaining amount, Rijal handed Rs 90,000 to Lama’s wife, requesting her not to make the issue public.

Paudel camp has been boycotting CWC meeting for the past one month over issues related to the 14th National Convention, number of party departments, constitution of Nepal Student’s Union and extension of tenure of Tarun Dal’s working committee.
The NC CWC on December 28 prepared the calendar of events for the next national convention proposing to hold it from February 19 to 22 in 2021. The meeting had decided to extend the tenure of the current leadership by one year from 3 March 2020, when the tenure of office bearers ends. The decision was taken on the basis of majority amid Paudel camp’s boycott.
The following day, the Paudel camp organised a press conference saying it would not accept the establishment faction’s decision to extend the tenure of the party’s leadership by one year.
Flanked by party General Secretary Shashank Koirala and another leader Prakash Man Singh, Paudel said while his party opposed the Nepal Communist Party (NCP)-led government’s unilateral move of making appointments in constitutional bodies on the pretext of majority, it was now witnessing a similar practice within the party as the party President Deuba had unilaterally decided to extend his tenure and prepared the calendar of events for the next national convention.

The number of patients admitted to hospitals after suffering from severe acute respiratory infection has gone up by 67 per cent in the last four weeks compared to the number of patients admitted to hospitals during the same period in 2018.
According to data provided by Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, as many as 1,085 people were admitted to hospitals in the last four weeks. There were 650 such cases reported during the same period last year. “The number is likely to increase as the mercury is dipping further across the country,” said Bibek Kumar Lal, director of EDCD.
Also a large number of patients suffering from respiratory illness, viral infection and fever are visiting out-patient departments of hospitals.
A record maintained by Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital shows that on an average 500 patients visit Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine Unit of the hospital daily. The hospital runs the OPD service three days a week. “Around 60 per cent of the patients visiting the OPD are suffering from respiratory illness triggered by cold. Most of them are suffering from common cold, pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma,” said Dr Niraj Bam, an associate professor working at Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine Unit of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital.
Patients with low immunity such as children, pregnant women, elderly persons, people with immune compromised status like organ transplant patients and cancer patients are prone to cold related illness,” said Dr Lal.
Data provided by Bir Hospital shows that on an average 120 patients visit the respiratory Out Patient Department on a daily basis. The hospital runs OPD service three days a week. “The number of patients suffering from cold related ailment has gone up because of excessive cold.
The humidity in air decreases in winter. Also virus and bacteria in the dust particles are mixed with droplets and in the process of breathing, these bacteria and viruses get inside human body and attack respiratory system,” said Dr Bam.“When someone coughs or sneezes the droplets do not dry up easily because of cold weather. People nearby can easily come in contact with bacteria and viruses,” said Bishnu Prasad Upadhyay, consultant microbiologist at National Academy of Medical Sciences.
“A delay in treatment leads to severe infection. It could lead to viral pneumonia and bacterial co-infection, ultimately leading to death,” added Bam.
“Respiratory virus is a major cause of acute respiratory infection, of which influenza is one of the major public health burdens. Rate of respiratory infection transmission is higher in winter,” said Upadhyay.

Hariram Sunil of Maharastra was taken into custody by a joint team of customs officials and security personnel after an X-ray machine detected metal in his body during security screening at TIA. He had arrived here on Flydubai flight from Dubai.
Police suspected that something was wrong with Sunil after they spotted him behaving suspiciously and walking in a peculiar way. When interrogated he admitted to concealing gold in his rectum. Police in association with doctors at Sinamangal-based KMC Hospital removed the contraband from his rectal cavity. He had concealed five pieces of gold in the rectum. TIA has reported four such cases of modus operandi for smuggling gold earlier.
On November 29, Sa Luitui, 22, a Chinese national was held with one kilogram gold concealed in his rectum at TIA. Despite police action, racketeers continue attempts to pass gold through the only international airport of the country. Police said racketeers were changing their modus operandi of gold smuggling through TIA. Concealing gold in the rectum, battery box, laptop, baggage, air-filter of vehicle, cargo trucks and inner sole of shoes are some of the ways adopted by smugglers. Smugglers also mould gold into jewellery and wear them to outsmart security officials.
Racketeers have been using returnee Nepali migrant workers to smuggle gold. Migrant workers are paid by the racketeers from the Gulf via wire after the consignment of gold is received by the concerned person in Nepal.
According to statistics released by Nepal Police, it seized 108 kilogram gold in 2018-19 compared to 72 kilograms in previous fiscal. Officials said they had not been able to completely control gold smuggling for want of hi-tech screening devices and detectors along the borders and TIA. Most of the smuggled gold enters Nepal through TIA and Tatopani and Rasuwagadhi-Kerung points via Tibet of China.

A notice published by the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens in the Nepal Gazette yesterday said the panel was formed in accordance with Section 3 (2) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act-1969.
“If the Government of Nepal is of the opinion that it is necessary to appoint a commission for the purpose of making an inquiry into any matter of public importance, it may appoint such a commission,” reads the act.
Members of the commission include two child rights experts and two joint secretaries from the Ministry of Home Affairs and MoWCSC. The notice stated that the commission was given three months time to complete the investigation and submit report, along with recommendations to reform Bal Mandir and action against its officials, if any, found to have involved in embezzlement of the state fund and other unauthorised activities.
The MoWCSC has determined the scope of the commission to ensure that it doesn’t deviate from its track. “The commission shall study the organisational propriety of Bal Mandir and children’s home, their policy provisions, structural arrangements and need for necessary reforms,” read the notice.
It also requires the commission to investigate into various decisions taken by the Kathmandu-based central office of Bal Mandir and its district offices in the past, to ascertain whether they were consistent with the prevailing laws and policy provisions or not.
“If the officials of Bal Mandir and district-based children’s homes are found to have made any decision contrary to the laws in force, the commission shall recommend the MoWCSC to initiate legal or departmental action against them,” read the notice.
In addition, the commission has been told to conduct inquiry into the use and management of land, buildings and other physical assets of Bal Mandir and children’s homes. The commission will also investigate into the activities carried out by Bal Mandir and children’s homes in the past to evaluate how effective they were for the protection and management of needy children entitled to the government facilities.
Office of the commission is situated in the MoWCSC, which will be provided with necessary budget through the Ministry of Finance. Director of Bal Mandir Balkrishna Dangol was arrested on August 14 for his alleged involvement in child trafficking. He had assisted a British woman Dina Smith in ‘buying’ a Nepali baby girl at Rs 450,000 and for obtaining fake documents to claim the baby as her own. Kathmandu District Court had remanded him to judicial custody. This was revealed after Smith was held by immigration office at Tribhuvan International Airport while trying to leave Nepal with the infant in the first week of August.
Naxal-based Bal Mandir was established in 1964 for the protection of orphans, helpless, abandoned and unclaimed children.

Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa during a security meeting with the ministry’s secretariat and head of security agencies, directed them to keep record of people living in rented properties.

As most of the illegal activities either by a single person or a group are found to be conducted by the persons living in rented rooms, it is important to maintain their records.
“Illegal activities like theft, robbery, swindling, banking fraud, cyber crime, sexual offense, are on the rise threatening peace and good governance,” states a press release issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
As per the direction, landlords and tenants, both are required to submit valid documents to reveal tenant’s identity, type of business or organisations they are running or they are associated with. Police are also directed to collect required information from the tenants.
The ministr y’s move comes in the wake of recent arrest of 122 Chinese nationals, who were found involved in illegal cyber activities, by renting homes across the capital city.
Police had arrested the Chinese nationals from nine rented houses in Manmaiju, Bansbari and Budhanilkantha.

A press released issued by the NHRC today said it was concerned about the inaction of the government against sugar mill operators who had not cleared dues of the farmers.
Hundreds of sugarcane farmers from Sarlahi, Rautahat and Nawalparasi, have been staging protest in Kathmandu to exert pressure to the government for recovery of their outstanding dues from the sugar mill operators.
NHRC said its team had been holding discussion with the officials of concerned ministries of Province 2, sugarcane farmers and sugar mill owners for justice to the victims.
“The farmers, who are dependent on sugarcane farming, have been denied their fundamental rights to earn and enjoy benefit through investment,” the NHRC said. It reminded the government about the provisions stipulated in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights-2011, which requires the state to protect farmers from business-related human rights abuse through judicial, administrative, legislative or other appropriate measures and provide the victims access to effective remedy.
According to the guiding principles, unless the state takes appropriate steps to investigate, punish and redress business-related human rights abuses, the state’s duty to protect its citizens can be rendered weak or even meaningless.
The NHRC has urged the government, sugar mills and all concerned parties to resolve the problem facing the sugarcane farmers and protect their fundamental and human rights.

He stated that a decision to that regard will be taken by the Office on the basis of a payment plan that the company is expected to submit. If the plan is approved, Ncell will have to clear the dues by mid-July of 2020, Adhikari added.
Meanwhile, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, on December 19, had issued an interim order directing the government — including the Inland Revenue Department and LTO — not to take any steps to enforce its decision to collect the outstanding capital gains tax, including interest and penalties, from the sale of Ncell by TeliaSonera Norway to Axiata UK.
Axiata had acquired 80 per cent stake in Ncell for $1.4 billion in April 2016.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong protesters marched through shopping malls on New Year’s Eve urging people not to give up the fight for democracy in 2020, while police were out in force across the city to quell any unrest.
As evening fell, dozens of protesters dropped flowers near the Prince Edward metro station, which was the scene of some of the most violent clashes with the police this summer.
Demonstrators plan a giant human chain later on as well as late-night demonstrations dubbed “Suck the Eve” in the downtown bar and entertainment district of Lan Kwai Fong and the picturesque Victoria Harbour.
Wong, a 22-year-old freelance photographer who gave only his last name, said he did not feel like celebrating New Year.
“I can’t even celebrate my birthday. I choose to stand here because at least we can chant a little and it feels like I’m with family,” he said.
The protests began in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, and have evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.
Many streets were decorated with Christmas lights and other seasonal paraphernalia, but the mood on Tuesday was less than festive as officers in riot gear patrolled the busiest areas.
In a prime shopping mall in the Tsim Sha Tsui area popular with tourists, dozens of protesters chanted pro-democracy slogans and riot police stopped people to search their backpacks.
Authorities have cancelled the popular midnight fireworks for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns.
The fireworks usually draw thousands of locals and tourists to the harbour front and the countdown is broadcast worldwide.
They will be replaced with “Symphony of Lights”, a multimedia light show involving projections on the city’s tallest skyscrapers at the stroke of midnight.
The facade of the waterside Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre was turned into a giant countdown clock.
“Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time is my New Year wish,” said 30-year-old Calvin, who attended a central lunchtime rally.
CARRIE LAM’S RESOLUTION
In a New Year’s Eve video message, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said more than six months of unrest in the Asian financial hub had caused sadness, anxiety, disappointment and rage.
“Let’s start 2020 with a new resolution, to restore order and harmony in society. So we can begin again, together,” said Lam in the 3-minute address.
“Hong Kong people have resolved many difficulties before. With our resilience and wisdom I believe we can once again overcome our current challenges and rebuild Hong Kong.”
Police say they have arrested nearly 6,500 people since the protests began escalating in what is the worst political crisis faced by the city in decades.
On Jan. 1, tens of thousands of people are expected to join a major pro-democracy march, after it received police approval to proceed.
The previous such march by organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), in early December, drew an estimated 800,000 people.
The New Year demonstrations follow a pick-up in clashes since Christmas Eve, when riot police fired tear gas at thousands of protesters following scuffles in shopping malls and in a prime tourist district.
“On New Year’s Day, we need to show our solidarity … to resist the government. We hope Hong Kong people will come onto the streets for Hong Kong‘s future,” said CHRF leader Jimmy Sham.

HONG KONG: Hundreds of protesters marched through Hong Kong shopping malls on Thursday, disrupting business in the Asian financial hub for a third day over the festive period and prompting riot police to close off a mall in a tourist district.
The “shopping protests” have targeted malls across the Chinese-ruled city since Christmas Eve, turning violent at times with police firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators in areas filled with shoppers and visitors.
While the turnout on Thursday was smaller than on the previous two days, riot police stepped up patrols at shopping centers on the Kowloon peninsula and in the rural New Territories.
Dozens of police with batons and shields surrounded and sealed off the Langham Place shopping mall in Kowloon’s Tsim Sha Tsui district after black-clad, masked protesters occupied it.
“I think the purpose for us to come out is to… let people realize that so many front-line protesters sacrificed (things) for them. They should not forget and (simply) celebrate Christmas,” said Sandy, a young demonstrator who wore a black mask to hide her identity.
“…We have been fighting for almost seven months now, and the Hong Kong police have done so many bad things.”
The protests began more than six months ago in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
They have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement, and became more confrontational over the festive season. Earlier in December, after pro-democracy candidates overwhelmingly won district council elections, they had been largely peaceful.
Many protesters have been angered by what they see as the use of unnecessary force by the police, and demanded an independent inquiry into the force’s behaviour.
Police, who say they have used only minimum force to control the protests, on Thursday detained several people at a mall in rural Tai Po, north of the city’s financial center, public broadcaster RTHK said.
Demonstrators are also angry at what they perceive as increased meddling by Beijing in freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering, saying it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula put in place at that time, and blames foreign forces for fomenting unrest.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam condemned the protesters in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying many Hong Kongers and tourists were disappointed their Christmas Eve celebrations had been ruined, while local businesses had also been hit.
On Thursday, some restaurants and stores pulled down their shutters in the malls as protesters, some wearing balaclavas and carrying black flags, marched by.
The government on Thursday criticized “unprecedented violence” by some protesters, but said that protecting freedoms and human rights remained a top priority.

The magnitude 6.1 quake was centred in mountainous Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan, at a depth of 210 km (130 miles), the US Geological Survey said.
Officials in Kabul said they were assessing damage in areas around the sparsely populated epicentre. In Pakistan, tremors shook furniture and power cable poles. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Waseem Ahmad, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority in Islamabad, estimated the quake to be about 6.4 magnitude.
“I was with my kids at a badminton court when we felt strong jolts,” said Nusrat Jabeen in Pakistan‘s capital. “It was very scary. We felt everything was shaking. We ran out for safety.”
Tremors were also felt in India’s mountainous Kashmir state where people rushed out of their homes and offices. The Indian subcontinent has suffered some of the largest earthquakes in the world.

159,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/veteran-climbers-skeptical-that-proposed-rules-for-mount-everest-will-stop-deaths/,"
KATHMANDU: Veteran climbers of Mount Everest are skeptical that proposed new regulations by the Nepalese government to tighten the permit process for adventurers will address the root causes of this year’s heavy death toll on the world’s tallest peak.
American mountaineers Ed Viesturs and Alan Arnette said planned new laws – if they are introduced at all – are unlikely to tackle the growing trend of inexperienced climbers rushing in packs to scale the 29,035-foot (8,850-metre) Himalayan peak.
“I’ve seen this movie so many times it’s totally predictable,” Arnette told Reuters in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “Every year since 2013, something goes wrong and they (the Nepal government) announce all these new rules and never implement them.”
Eleven climbers died on Mount Everest this year – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side. Many perished when a rush to climb the mountain during a short window of suitable weather in late May led to a “traffic jam” near the summit.
“Most teams opt to go for the summit when the first weather window is predicted,” Viesturs told Reuters in one of a series of interviews by phone and email.
“Everyone is afraid of missing what might be the one and only perfect day. There are typically several good summit days, but there’s pressure to go when everyone else goes.”
Nepal has traditionally issued climbing permits to anyone prepared to pay the $11,000 fee, handing out a record 381 passes this year. With essential Sherpas and guides added, more than 800 people were trying to reach the summit during the short weather window.
TRAFFIC JAM IN THE DEATH ZONE
The overcrowding – which caught worldwide attention when a photograph of a queue of climbers stepping over bodies to reach the summit went viral – caused fatal delays in the thin air in what is known as the “death zone” above 8,000 metres. That raised concerns that inexperienced mountaineers were being encouraged to attempt the climb by unscrupulous guide companies.
Among the changes proposed by the Nepalese government is a requirement for climbers to submit a medical report by a certified doctor disclosing their history and state of health. Another suggested requirement was the climbers submit proof they had scaled another 6,500-metre peak in Nepal.
Arnette said the first change was unlikely to be enough, given the potential to forge medical documents, while the second made little sense as many climbers have scaled higher peaks elsewhere.
The recommendations have been submitted to the cabinet for approval, Mira Acharya, who oversees climbing activities for the Nepal government’s Department of Tourism, told Reuters last week. The government has not given a time frame for the introduction of new laws.
Viesturs, who has an extensive history on Everest, said the proposed changes did not do enough to tackle the “group think” pack mentality that led to the traffic jam in late May, a problem he said also needed to be addressed by climb leaders at base camp.
“I know several climbers who waited until later and had the mountain almost to themselves,” Viesturs said of this year’s climbing season. “We really need to answer why so many people are on the summit ridge on the same day? How can you control it?”

160,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/charity-sues-kenya-over-treatment-of-trafficked-indian-nepali-women/,"NAIROBI: A charity said on Monday it is suing the Kenyan government over a failure to provide five women trafficked from India and Nepal for sexual exploitation with appropriate care after they were rescued.
HAART Kenya said a decision to make the three Nepali and two Indian women rescued from a Nairobi bar in August stay and testify against their alleged traffickers had caused them psychological harm.
“After four months, the victims just want to go home. They have become deeply traumatised and suicidal … some have been hospitalised,” said Sophie Otiende, programme consultant for HAART Kenya, which has rented a safe house for the victims.
“So we have filed a complaint against the government so that all victims of trafficking are not compelled to testify, and the government pays for their speedy and safe repatriation.”
The government has said it hopes to repatriate the five women, aged in their early to mid-twenties, in the coming days.
The petition, due to be heard on Tuesday, states that Kenya’s attorney general, inspector general of police and director of public prosecutions violated an anti-trafficking law that says victims have a right to privacy and safe repatriation.
It also calls on authorities to pay expenses of more than 1.3 million Kenyan shillings ($12,830) incurred by the charity for the care of the victims, which the law says is the state’s responsibility.
Kenyan government officials denied a lack of care and said no request for funds had been received.
“We have received requests from other charities which are being considered. If HAART approached us, we would of course consider providing funds for these victims,” said Elizabeth Mbuka, Head of the Counter Trafficking in Persons Secretariat.
Mbuka said a court order for the repatriation of the five women had now been given.
BOLLYWOOD BARS
A rising number of women and girls are leaving South Asian nations such as Nepal, India and Pakistan to work in Bollywood-style dance bars in Kenya’s adult entertainment industry – many illegally – according to anti-trafficking activists and police.
There is no official data, but the results of police raids combined with figures on repatriation of rescued women suggest scores of women and underage girls are victims of organised human trafficking from South Asia to Kenya.
Common in India, so-called mujra dance bars – where young women dance to Bollywood music for money from male patrons – have mushroomed in cities including Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, where large numbers of Kenyans of South Asian descent live.
Police and anti-trafficking groups have repeatedly voiced concerns that some of these private clubs are used as a front to ensnare women and girls, some in sex slavery, with women forced to pay off loans by erotic dancing or having sex with clients.
An official from the Indian High Commission in Nairobi said there had been “a few” cases involving the trafficking of Indian women to Kenyan dance bars.
“Whenever there is a case, we request consular access and provide whatever support we can to the victims,” said the official, who did not want to be named.
“We try to ensure that all Indian nationals go back as soon as possible, but we can only do this when the court orders this in the host country.”

TIRANA/THUMANE: At least 13 people were killed when the most powerful earthquake to hit Albania in decades shook the capital Tirana and the country’s west and north on Tuesday, tearing down buildings and burying residents under rubble.
Residents, some carrying babies, fled apartment buildings in Tirana and the western port of Durres after the 6.4 magnitude quake struck shortly before 4 a.m. (0300 GMT).
In the northern town of Thumane, Marjana Gjoka, 48, was sleeping in her apartment on the fourth floor of a five-storey building when the quake shattered the top floors.
“The roof collapsed on our head and I don’t know how we escaped. God helped us,” said Gjoka, whose three-year-old niece was among four people in the apartment when the quake struck.
The quake was centred 30 km (19 miles) west of Tirana, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said, and was also felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia.
Hours later a magnitude 5.4 earthquake hit Bosnia, with an epicentre 75 km (45 miles) south of Sarajevo, monitors said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
Five people were found dead in the rubble of apartment buildings in the northern Albanian town of Thumane and a man died in the town of Kurbin after jumping out of a building, a Defence Ministry spokeswoman said.
Seven bodies were pulled from collapsed buildings in Durres, the main port and tourism destination, the Defence Ministry said, adding 39 had been pulled out alive from under the ruins.
Defence Minister Olta Xhacka said 135 people were injured.
Firefighters, police and civilians were removing the debris from collapsed buildings in Thumane. Most of the buildings that collapsed were built of bricks, a Reuters reporter said.
Rescuers in Thumane used a mechanical digger to claw at collapsed masonry and remove a tangle of metal and cables. Others groped with bare hands to clear rubble.
Two people were pulled from rubble in Thumane four hours after the quake, a Reuters reporter said. Doctors said they were in a bad condition.
“Everything at home kept falling down,” Refik, a Tirana resident, said of the impact on his sixth-floor apartment.
“We were awake because of the previous quakes, but the last one shook us around,” he told Reuters, referring to smaller tremors recorded in the hour before the main quake.
Rescuers told local media one of the dead was an elderly woman who saved her grandson by cradling him with her body.
TRAPPED
Xhacka said the quake’s epicentre was in Durres. It was followed by 100 aftershocks.
“Durres and Thumane are the areas worst hit. Rescue-and-save work continues in the collapsed buildings there,” she said as troops pulled a victim from a hotel in Durres.
At least 135 people were injured, with 72 hospitalized, Xhacka said. Two planes from fellow NATO-member Romania were expected to land with specialized search and rescue equipment and help was coming from Italy and Turkey, Xhacka said.
Greece had sent emergency services for search and rescue operations, its premier’s office said.
“Firefighters and army staff are helping residents under the rubble”, in Durres and Thumane, the Defence Ministry said.
An unidentified man, with a wound dressing on his right cheek, told News24 TV his daughter and niece were among those trapped in a collapsed apartment building in Durres.
“I talked with my daughter and niece on the phone. They said they are well and are waiting for the rescue. Could not talk to my wife. There are other families, but I could not talk to them,” the man said.
Located along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, between Greece and Macedonia, Albania experiences regular seismic activity.
An earthquake of 5.6 magnitude shook the country on Sept. 21, damaging around 500 houses and destroying some. The Defence Ministry had said it was the most powerful quake in Albania in the last 30 years.
The images of collapsed buildings in urban areas suggested Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than one in 1979 which razed a neighbourhood of a northern town. Neither of those two earlier earthquakes caused fatalities.
The Balkan nation is the poorest country in Europe, with an average income of less than a third of the European Union average, according to Eurostat data.

SYDNEY: Firefighters battled hundreds of bushfires across Australia on Thursday as scores of blazes sprang up in new locations, triggering warnings that it was too late for some residents to evacuate.
As Thick smoke blanketed the most populous city of Sydney for a third day, residents were urged to keep children indoors, stepping up pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to tackle climate change.
By early afternoon, dozens of fires were burning across the southeastern state of Victoria and temperatures of 40.9 Celsius (105.6 F) in Melbourne, its capital, matched the hottest day on record in 1894, Australia‘s weather bureau said.
Authorities warned residents of towns about 50 km (31 miles) north of Ballarat, the state’s third largest city, that it was too late for them to evacuate safely.
“You are in danger, act now to protect yourself,” fire authorities said in an alert. “It is too late to leave. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately.”
Blazes across several states have endangered thousands of people, killing at least four people this month, burning about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroying more than 400 homes.
The early arrival and severity of the fires in the southern hemisphere spring follows three years of drought that experts have linked to climate change and which have left bushland tinder-dry.
With 10 days remaining to the official start of summer, extreme temperatures and high winds have sparked wildfires in new areas, even as firefighters tracked the crisis across the mainland, the Northern Territory and the island of Tasmania.
In Victoria, power to more than 100,000 homes was knocked out amid lightning strikes and strong, gusty winds of more than 110 kph (68 mph) that knocked tree branches into power lines, ahead of a cool change expected to bring relief in the evening.
The extensive damage was likely to leave some customers without power through the night as utilities worked to restore networks and fix downed powerlines, a spokeswoman for power provider Ausnet said.
State authorities issued its first Code Red alert in a decade, signifying the worst possible bushfire conditions, warning that should a fire start it would be fast moving, unpredictable and probably uncontrollable.
In the state of New South Wales, strong winds blew smoke from 60 fires still burning over much of Sydney, shrouding the harbour city and its famous landmarks in thick smog.
The state imposed tough new water curbs in Sydney from Dec. 10, when a key dam is expected to be down to 45% capacity. Residents face fines if they use hoses to water their gardens and wash their cars.
CLIMATE POLITICS
The unrelenting conditions have sharpened attention on the climate change policies of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who rejected any link.
“Climate change is a global phenomenon, and we’re doing our bit as part of the response to climate change,” Morrison told ABC radio.
“To suggest that, with just 1.3% of global emissions, that Australia doing something differently – more or less – would have changed the fire outcome this season, I don’t think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all.”
Morrison’s conservative government has committed to the Paris Agreement for a cut in emissions from 26% to 28% by 2030, versus 2005 levels. Critics say current projections suggest it will miss that target and have urged remedial steps.

163,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/singapore-court-to-hear-legal-challenges-on-gay-sex-ban/,"KUALA LUMPUR: As a Singapore court prepares to hear a series of legal challenges to a law that bans gay sex, LGBT+ activists on Tuesday called for the “right” verdict to be delivered so similar reforms can be triggered across other parts of Asia.
Like many other former British colonies, Singapore has retained an old law that criminalises gay sex, which was scrapped by India in a landmark court ruling last year to give a boost to LGBT+ rights.
Empowered by the Indian ruling, three Singaporean activists have launched separate bids in a renewed push to decriminalise gay sex in the city-state, where a high court is due to begin hearing their cases on Wednesday.
“I think public opinion is pretty clear across religious and age segments that homosexuality should not be a criminal offence,” Johnson Ong Ming, who was among the trio, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Ong, a DJ also known as DJ Big Kid, was the first to launch the case in September last year. The former head of a LGBT+ rights charity and a retired doctor also filed similar lawsuits later.
“I have full confidence in our judicial system and I am hopeful that the court will come to the right decision … and overturn Section 377A,” Ong said by email.
The court has set aside six days in November for the legal challenges to be heard but it is unclear when the proceedings will wrap up.
Under Section 377A of Singapore’s Penal Code, a man found to have committed an act of “gross indecency” with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare. The law does not apply to homosexual acts between women.
Singapore has emerged as a modern nation since independence six decades ago but socially it remains conservative, partly due to sensitivities stemming from multi-religious groups among its 5.6 million population.
Previous legal challenges to overturn the ban have failed, although recent opinion polls indicated there has been growing support for gay rights.
Opposition to gay marriage had fallen to 60%, down from 74% in 2013, according to a poll of more than 4,000 people published in May by the Institute of Policy Studies, a Singapore think-tank.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong however has previously said that Singapore society “is not that liberal on these matters”.
The Singapore court cases are being closely watched by LGBT+ groups in some other parts of Asia that have maintained the colonial-era law, including in Myanmar and Malaysia.
“If the decision in Singapore goes our way, then it will boost our morale here in Malaysia,” said Numan Afifi, president of the LGBT+ advocacy Pelangi Campaign in Malaysia.
Aung Myo Min, executive director from the Yangon-based Equality Myanmar LGBT+ campaign group said both Singapore and Myanmar “should follow the example of India” and repeal the archaic law.
Gay sex is a crime in both countries, with those convicted facing sentences of up to 10 years in jail in Myanmar and 20 years in Malaysia.

164,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/at-least-40-killed-as-fresh-protests-engulf-iraq-3/,"BAGHDAD: At least 40 protesters were killed in Iraq on Friday when security forces used tear gas and an Iranian-backed militia opened fire to try to quell renewed demonstrations against corruption and economic hardship, security sources said.

A government intelligence officer and a member of the powerful Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia were killed in a clash with protesters in the southern city of Amara, police sources said.
More than 2,000 people were injured nationwide, according to medical sources and the Iraqi High Commission on Human Rights (IHCHR), as demonstrators vented frustration at political elites they say have failed to improve their lives after years of conflict.
“All we want are four things: jobs, water, electricity, and safety. That’s all we want,” said 16-year-old Ali Mohammed who had covered his face with a T-shirt to avoid inhaling tear gas, as chaotic scenes overwhelmed Baghdad‘s central Tahrir Square.
Sirens wailed and tear gas canisters landed amid groups of young protesters draped in Iraqi flags and chanting “with life and blood we defend you Iraq.”
The bloodshed is the second major bout of violence this month. A series of clashes two weeks ago between protesters and security forces left 157 people dead and over 6,000 wounded.
The unrest has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which lived through foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State (IS) insurgency between 2003 and 2017. It is the biggest challenge to security since IS was declared beaten.
On Friday, eight protesters were killed in Baghdad, the IHCHR said. At least five of them were protesters struck by tear gas canisters, security sources said.
In the south, at least nine protesters were killed when members of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) militia opened fire on protesters who tried to set fire to the group’s office in the city of Nasiriya, according to security sources.
Eight people were killed in Amara city, including six protesters, one AAH member and one intelligence officer, police sources said. Three protesters were killed in oil-rich Basra, one in Hilla, and one in Samawa, security sources said.
In Diwaniya city, twelve protesters died after being trapped in a burning building, morgue officials and police sources said.
The building, which housed the local offices of the Iran-backed Badr Organisation, was apparently torched by protesters unaware that others were already inside.
Interior Ministry spokesman Khalid al-Muhanna said at least 68 members of the security forces were injured.
The sometimes violent demonstrations erupted in Baghdad on October 1 and spread to southern cities.
They pose the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi since he took office just a year ago. Despite promising reforms and ordering a broad cabinet reshuffle, he has so far struggled to address the protesters’ discontent.
POVERTY, DESPITE OIL WEALTH
Despite the OPEC member country’s vast oil wealth, many Iraqis live in poverty, have limited access to clean water, electricity, basic healthcare or decent education as the country tries to recover from years of conflict and economic hardship.
Many Iraqis view the elite as subservient to one or other of Iraq’s two main allies, the United States and Iran. Many suspect these powers use Iraq to pursue their struggle for regional influence via proxies unconcerned with ordinary people’s needs.
“They hit us last night and again this morning. We don’t have any demands anymore, we want the government toppled,” said demonstrator Salah Mohammad.
“We want Iran to take its parties and leave, America to take its parties and leave, and let the Iraqi people decide.”
In Basra, Reuters footage showed protesters clashing with security forces who launched tear gas canisters and stun grenades and were met by rocks thrown at their vehicles. Young men carried the injured away, as protesters set police cars on fire.
An 8 pm curfew was imposed until further notice in the southern provinces of Basra, Muthanna, Wasit, Babel and Dhi Qar, after protesters torched offices of lawmakers, Shi’ite political parties and militia headquarters.
How the government and security forces handled Friday’s planned protests had been seen as a litmus test for the stability of the country with political leaders already on edge.
RAGE AGAINST THE ELITE
In a Thursday night address, Abdul Mahdi stressed that violence would not be tolerated and warned that any collapse of the government would drag Iraq into further turmoil.
Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who in recent weeks criticised the government’s handling of the protests, urged calm on all sides during his sermon on Friday.
In Baghdad, many demonstrators initially believed authorities would refrain from violence after security forces killed dozens of protesters earlier this month.
Hundreds tried throughout the day to march into the city’s fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies, when they were stopped by security forces.
By afternoon, the mood had shifted with thousands of angry protesters wrapped in Iraqi flags under pouring rain, chanting that they were peaceful and calling political leaders corrupt.
As clashes broke out, tuk-tuks carried the injured to hospitals. Medical sources told Reuters hundreds of people had been treated for injuries, most related to tear gas exposure.

AYODHYA: In the Indian town of Ayodhya, minority Muslims are feeling under siege as they await a Supreme Court ruling on a centuries-old religious dispute that has cast a shadow over their relations with the majority Hindu community.
After a tangle of legal cases, the Supreme Court in August decided to hear arguments every day in an effort to resolve the dispute over what should be built on the ruins of the 16th-century Babri Masjid, destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992.
The uproar over the mosque triggered some of India‘s deadliest riots, in which nearly 2,000 people, most of them Muslim, were killed.
The bloody controversy raised lingering questions about the role of religion in the officially secular country, and the place of Muslims in it.
Last month, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi finished the hearings and is expected to pronounce his verdict in the next couple of weeks.
Whichever way it goes, the decision is likely to have a significant impact on the fraught relationship between India‘s Hindus and Muslims, who constitute 14% of its 1.3 billion people.
While most Muslim religious leaders want the mosque to be rebuilt, Hindus say there is evidence there was a temple on the site before the mosque was built in 1528 by a commander of Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty.
Construction of a “grand temple” in Ayodhya has long been an election promise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won a second term with a landslide this year.
Fearing tension after the court decision, Mohammed Shahid, 48, the grandson of the mosque’s last Imam, or prayer leader, has decided to move his family away.
He has reason to be afraid.
Shahid’s father, Mohammed Shabir, was killed by a mob of Hindus who rampaged through Ayodhya before tearing down the mosque on Dec. 6, 1992.
“In 1992, we decided to stay put – a decision that we live to regret,” Shahid said, sitting in the courtyard of his run-down, two-storied house.
“Other than killing my father, they set ablaze our house and a sawmill, our only source of income.”
‘BAD ELEMENTS’
Shahid said he was glad that his grandfather, who had died in 1990, did not see the destruction of the mosque.
Unlike Shahid, Haji Mahboob Ahmad, a 66-year-old Muslim community leader who lives near the site, doesn’t plan to leave.
But he shares Shahid’s anxiety.
“We’re conscious of the fact that some bad elements can try to foment trouble by taking advantage of the situation and that’s why I’ve requested authorities to ensure the safety of Ayodhya’s Muslims,” Ahmad said.
Ahmad said India‘s founding fathers established it as a secular democracy, and it must remain that.
The day Shahid’s father was killed, Hindu Hajari Lal, 57, escaped death.
Lal was among the hundreds of Hindus who destroyed the mosque with shovels, hammers and their bare hands, bringing down its domes before the whole structure collapsed.
Unfortunately for Lal, part of the building fell on him, trapping him in the rubble with broken bones.
“Since that fateful day of 1992, the only objective of my life is to see a permanent temple on the site. I can die in peace if I get to see the temple,” Lal said.
‘ENDLESSLY WAITING’
For Hindus, Lal said, the site in Ayodhya was as sacred as Mecca is in Islam.
That’s because Lal and millions of other Hindus believe the mosque was built at the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities.
Lal helps to guide a steady stream of pilgrims who come to see a model of what they hope will become a new temple.
Visitors can also look at an open field of masonry, in pink sandstone, including piles of ornately carved columns. Concrete pillars and blocks for foundations are also ready.
“Once the court green-lights construction of the temple, we can quickly move these concrete blocks from the workshop to the temple site,” said Sharad Sharma, spokesman for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council.
Top politicians, including some cabinet ministers, regularly visit Ayodhya to pay their respect to Nritya Gopal Das, an influential monk and chairman of a trust committed to building the temple.
“I’m sure Modi ji is aware of the sentiments of millions of Hindus who have been endlessly waiting to see the Ram temple,” said Das, using an honorific for Modi.

Canada named top country for social entrepreneurs
United States suffers biggest fall amid political uncertainty
More youth interest in working for businesses that do good



LONDON: Canada was named the best country for business leaders seeking to tackle social problems in a global poll on Tuesday while the United States fell from top slot due to political uncertainty.
Australia came second in the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s second global survey on the best countries for social entrepreneurs, seeing the biggest gain of 24 places from the inaugural poll in 2016, while France came third.
Mexico came last, down 15 places from 2016, but the United States was the biggest loser, plunging to 32nd place from No. 1, with the poll of about 900 social enterprise experts pointing to difficulties with government policy and access to investment.
Francois Bonnici, head of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, said over the past three years there had been “some amazing gains and some ongoing challenges” for social entrepreneurs addressing issues from climate change to refugees.
“Governments are recognising that to meet their own agendas this is a group of citizens and entrepreneurs that actually want to improve society and the environment,” said Bonnici.
“But it has a slightly different flavour in each country and that government role is important (as it) can legitimise the sector in their country by creating these policies.”
Business entrepreneurs globally are increasingly setting their sights on social problems with ventures that can be a commercial success while addressing problems like unemployment, homelessness, mental health, knife crime and even loneliness.
For example in South Africa social enterprise Harambee has created a ‘dating service’ to match unemployed youth with employers, while in India Project Patradya is tackling the waste problem by employing Afghan refugee women to make edible bowls.
But with little data on which nations were encouraging the sector, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in partnership with Deutsche Bank, began a poll in 2016 which was repeated in 2019. Social entrepreneurs, academics, investors and support agencies in the world’s 45 biggest economies, as ranked by the World Bank, were asked their views. Iran and Saudi Arabia were dropped in 2019 as it was impossible to get the right sample.
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
The 2019 poll found most experts, 82%, said social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum in their countries – although this was down three percentage points from 2016.
Canada, Indonesia and South Africa were named as the top countries where social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum, while Mexico, the United States and China saw the biggest falls.
Despite this, more than half of respondents – 54% – said the public still did not understand what they did which was not helped by the lack of a global definition of social enterprise. Italians were most aware of their work and Poles the least.
“People are becoming aware that the whole notion of social entrepreneurship is not just kumbaya,” said former Bangladeshi-U.S. investment banker Durreen Shahnaz, founder of the first social stock exchange, Impact Investment Exchange (IIX).
“It really is about doing serious work and making sure that work is scalable … There are signs the industry is maturing.”
The rising interest of young people – under the age of 25 – was a new finding, with three in four experts saying more young people were interested in working in social enterprises.
Indonesian social entrepreneur Denica Flesch wanted a career where she had a direct impact in the fight against poverty so in 2016, aged 26, she founded SukkhaCitta, an online marketplace selling clothes made by female artisans in Indonesian villages. “Young people are really challenging the notion of work, and combining purpose and career in one place,” said Flesch.
“They’re more idealistic and want to do something that’s beyond just looking for money.”
Canada was named as the top country where young people were playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs, followed by Germany and France, as well as the top place for women leaders.
WOMEN TAKING A LEAD
“Culturally we are about diversity and inclusion at a national level. That’s our brand, so that is helpful for the environment for social enterprise,” said Marcia Nozick, founder and chief executive of Vancouver-based social enterprise EMBERS.
She said policies that encouraged governments to buy the services of social impact ventures had been vital in helping the growth of EMBERS, which finds flexible jobs for people in a deprived part of Vancouver.
Nozick said there were many female leaders because it was “about caring and relationships and that has always been at the forefront of what women have brought to the business sector”.
Women were also seen as playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs in Australia, Belgium, Sweden and Malaysia.
The United States was named the worst place for female social entrepreneurs – the same as in 2016 – while Argentina and China slumped the most in questions regarding women in the poll conducted online and by telephone between May 7 and July 30.
The biggest falls for the United States overall related to access to investment, selling to businesses and supportive government policy.
Attracting investment continued to be a challenge, according to 56% of experts, down two percentage points from 2016.
Bonnie Chiu, founder and chief executive of Lensational, a social enterprise that trains marginalised women as photographers, said there was more capital available to social entrepreneurs but they had to jump through hoops to get it.
“So much time is spent chasing these opportunities,” said Chiu, whose business is based in Britain and Hong Kong.
“Traditional businesses just need to prove that they are financially sound, traditional charities just need to prove that they are generating social impact – but social enterprises need to do both.”
But regardless of the problems getting political support, financing or selling to businesses, experts said there would always be a need for social entrepreneurs to address the world’s largest problems where markets or public policy had failed.
“The more our political leaders might struggle to solve the world’s most pressing problems, the more opportunity for social entrepreneurs to come up with solutions,” said Jude O’Reilly, a senior director at U.S. nonprofit the Skoll Foundation.

OTTAWA: Canadians began voting on Monday to determine whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept into office four years ago as a charismatic figure promising “sunny ways,” will remain in power after two major scandals.
Polls opened in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland, with voting set to end in the Pacific Coast province of British Columbia at 7 p.m. (0200 GMT on Tuesday).
Trudeau, 47, the Liberal Party leader, was endorsed by former Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama in the final stretch of the campaign and is viewed as one of the last remaining progressive leaders among the world’s major democracies.
But he was shaken during the campaign by a blackface scandal and has been dogged by criticism of his handling of a corruption case involving a major Canadian construction company. Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has also had to overcome a sense of fatigue with his government.
Trudeau, accompanied by his wife and three children, voted in Montreal on Monday after a marathon sprint campaigning across the country in the past four days.
His Liberals and the main opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer are in a neck-and-neck race, according to opinion polls.
“The truth is it’s a coin toss right now,” said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker.
A year ago, no one would have predicted that Trudeau risked being the first prime minister since the 1930s to secure a parliamentary majority and then fail to win a second term.
The latest opinion polls suggest he may narrowly avert that result and could return to office with a minority in the 338-seat House of Commons. That would still leave Trudeau in a weakened position and needing the support of left-leaning opposition parties to push through key pieces of legislation.
The Canadian dollar was trading at a new three-month high on Monday, where “domestic attention is squarely on the 43rd federal election today,” said Shaun Osborne, chief market strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
“After some noise around the vote, we think FX players will refocus attention on the Bank of Canada policy outlook, the Fed and international backdrop pretty quickly,” he said.
Despite Scheer’s dimpled smile, Trudeau’s main rival has proven to be a determined opponent.
“He can’t even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he’s always wearing a mask,” Scheer said during a debate. “Mr. Trudeau, you are a phony and you are a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country.”
In his bid to unseat Trudeau, Scheer is also promising to balance the federal budget and eliminate a “carbon tax” on fossil fuels. Scheer, 40, is running his first campaign as party leader after winning a bitter Conservative leadership fight in 2017.
BUMPY CAMPAIGN RIDE
The six-week official campaign period has been a rough and meandering ride with dirty tactics on both sides.
The liberal image of Trudeau, who has championed diversity as prime minister and whose father opened up the country to mass immigration, took a severe blow when pictures emerged early in the campaign of him wearing blackface in the early 1990s and in 2001.
Trudeau had already been wrestling with the fallout from accusations he pressured his justice minister to help shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc from corruption charges. In August, a top watchdog said Trudeau breached ethics rules.
Given the fact that neither of the front-runners could come away with a parliamentary majority, it is the smaller left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) or the separatist Bloc Quebecois that could end up holding the balance of power.
“I am a lifelong Liberal voter and I am stumped on this one, mostly because I am really concerned about a Conservative win and just trying to figure out how to vote strategically,” said Kristin Street, 33, a strategy manager at a computer games company, in Port Moody, British Columbia.
EKOS Research pollster Frank Graves said Liberals needed turnout to be similar to four years ago or otherwise the Conservatives may have an edge.
“We may well be waiting until the final vote tallies in British Columbia to see who will win on Monday,” Graves said.

JAKARTA: Indonesian authorities said on Thursday more than 11,500 people have been evacuated from the town of Wamena in the easternmost province of Papua since dozens died during clashes last month in the area.
Located on the western half of the island of New Guinea and long racked by a simmering separatist insurgency, Papua encompasses Indonesia’s two easternmost provinces and has a distinct ethnic Melanesian population.
There has been a spike in protests and unrest since late August after Papuan students in Surabaya, Indonesia’s second city on the island of Java, were taunted and attacked by a mob chanting racial epithets over accusations they had desecrated a national flag.
In some of the worst bloodshed in decades in Papua, 33 people died and scores were hurt during clashes in Wamena on Sept. 23.
Government offices and homes were burned down, and 250 cars and motorcycles destroyed, as indigenous Papuans and security forces clashed.
The government and some Papuan independence activists say 25 of the 33 who died there were migrants from elsewhere in the country.
Erizal, 42, a former resident of Wamena who had left, said his child and wife died during the unrest and he now felt too traumatised to consider returning to the town.
“I am in my village in Padang now, maybe I will not return back to Wamena,” he said by telephone from the Padang area on Sumatra island where he was originally from.
He said his shop had also been burnt down in the unrest.
Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 2 Indonesia‘s air force had flown 7,467 people out of Wamena on Hercules planes, while 4,179 people had left on commercial flights, said Harry Hikmat, an official at Indonesia‘s social ministry.
Ahmad Musthofa Kamal, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said the situation in Wamane was now stable and that shops and markets were open again.
A former Dutch colony, Papua was formally incorporated into Indonesia in 1969, after a disputed vote of about 1,025 hand-picked tribal leaders. The result of the plebiscite was overseen and endorsed by the United Nations.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has opened the door to holding talks with separatists in Papua, a departure from the stance of previous governments and some of his cabinet ministers.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong police fired water cannon, rubber bullets and round after round of tear gas at petrol-bomb and brick-throwing protesters on Sunday in some of the most widespread violence in more than three months of anti-government unrest.
Running battles in the Causeway Bay shopping district, Wan Chai bar area and the Admiralty district of central government offices followed a night of showdowns with police in the Chinese-ruled city after a peaceful pro-democracy rally turned ugly on the streets outside.
More protests are planned in the run-up to China’s Oct. 1 National Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.
Police also fired tear gas from the roof of the Legislative Council building, which activists trashed and daubed with graffiti weeks ago.
Protesters, many of them wearing their trademark black with face masks, took cover from the tear gas behind umbrellas and held their ground on Sunday, some throwing tear gas canisters back at police as a helicopter flew overhead.
They built barricades with trolleys and trash cans and other debris. One threw a petrol bomb at police in the Wan Chai metro station.
At least one petrol bomb landed in the grounds of central government offices where several windows were smashed.
Police, who traditionally raise placards warning of retaliation before firing tear gas or firing water cannon, made several arrests, grappling people to the tarmac. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.
The water cannon fired blue dye, which elsewhere in the world is used to make identification of offenders easier.
The government said that the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, will be out of town for China’s National Day, despite her having sent out invitations for celebrations at home.
Some shops closed ahead of expected demonstrations, while the MTR metro service shut stations, a move that has made it a target of violence in the past.
Protesters shouted anti-China slogans and called for their “five demands, not one less” of the government, including universal suffrage and the dropping of all charges against their arrested colleagues.
About 200 China supporters dressed in red T-shirts gathered on top of Victoria Peak, overlooking the harbour, at around midday. They sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted “I love China”.
Angela, a housewife in her 40s, a Chinese flag sticker plastered on her cheek, said the pro-democracy protesters were “thugs”.
“If the government takes violent action I don’t object,” she said. “We have tolerated enough. I think I have emotional problems because of the riots. Because it’s not safe to go out.”
CHANGE OF HEART
Lam, the focus of weeks of anti-government unrest, will leave for Beijing on Monday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic the following day.
Lam, who was trapped in an indoor stadium by street protests for hours this week after an “open dialogue” with the people, will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night overland, minimising the chances of a clash at the airport, a popular target of anti-government protests.
She had sent out invitations “requesting the pleasure of your company” at a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Tuesday.
It was not immediately clear why she had the change of heart but the government said Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung would stand in for her.
Arthur, 40, wearing glasses and a mask covering the lower half of his face, said Lam’s trip was expected.
“In these three months, Carrie Lam has not really cared about the protesters. She only cares about the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) or what we might call ‘her boss’,” he said. “I think Hong Kong is somehow at this moment the frontline between Western democracy and the dictatorship in China…. Hong Kong looks more and more like a police state.”
Police fired tear gas and water cannon on Saturday night to disperse protesters who threw petrol bombs and rocks, broke government office windows and blocked a key road near the local headquarters of China’s People’s Liberation Army.
Anti-government protesters have attacked the legislature, Beijing’s main Liaison Office, occupied the airport, thrown petrol bombs at police, vandalised metro stations and set street fires in the former British colony.
Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.
The protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.
China dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.
Protests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement. Rallies in support of the anti-government protesters were held in Australia’s largest cities, with the biggest in Sydney.
Many wore face masks to hide their identity and crowds yelled “stand with Hong Kong” and “fight for freedom”, while placards depicted Chinese President Xi Jinping with a cross marked across his face.

NEW YORK: Earth is in more hot water than ever before, and so are we, an expert United Nations climate panel warned in a grim new report Wednesday.
Sea levels are rising at an ever-faster rate as ice and snow shrink, and oceans are getting more acidic and losing oxygen, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report issued as world leaders met at the United Nations.
The agency warned that if steps aren’t taken to reduce emissions and slow global warming, seas will rise 3 feet by the end of the century, with many fewer fish, less snow and ice, stronger and wetter hurricanes and other, nastier weather systems.
“The oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble, and that means we’re all in big trouble, too,” said one of the report’s lead authors, Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “The changes are accelerating.”
The dire effects will be felt on both land and sea, harming people, plants, animals, food, societies, infrastructure and the global economy. In fact, the international team of scientists projected for the first time that some island nations will probably become uninhabitable.
The oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat from carbon pollution in the air, as well as much of the carbon dioxide itself. Earth’s snow and ice, called the cryosphere, are also being eroded.
“The world’s oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe,” said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a deputy assistant administrator for research at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The report found:
Seas are now rising at one-seventh of an inch (3.66 millimeters) a year, which is 2.5 times faster than the rate from 1900 to 1990.
The world’s oceans have already lost 1% to 3% of the oxygen in their upper levels since 1970 and will lose more as warming continues.
From 2006 to 2015, the ice melting from Greenland, Antarctica and the world’s mountain glaciers has accelerated. They are now losing 720 billion tons (653 billion metric tons) of ice a year.
Arctic June snow cover has shrunk more than half since 1967, down nearly 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).
Arctic sea ice in September, the annual low point, is down almost 13% per decade since 1979. This year’s low, reported Monday, tied for the second-lowest on record.
Marine animals are likely to decrease 15%, and catches by fisheries in general are expected to decline 21% to 24%, by the end of century because of climate change.
“Climate change is already irreversible,” French climate scientist Valérie Masson-Delmotte, a report lead author, said at a news conference in Monaco, where the document was released. “Due to the heat uptake in the ocean, we can’t go back.”
But many of the worst-case projections in the report can still be avoided, depending on how the world handles the emissions of heat-trapping gases, the report’s authors said.
The IPCC increased its projected end-of-century sea level rise in the worst-case scenario by nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) from its 2013 projections because of the increased recent melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.
The new report projects that, under the business-as-usual scenario for carbon emissions, seas by the end of the century will rise between 2 feet (61 centimeters) and 43 inches (110 centimeters), with a most likely rise of 33 inches (84 centimeters). This is slightly less than the traditional 1 meter (39 inches) that scientists often use.
And sea level will rise two to three times as much over the centuries to come if warming continues, so the world is looking at a “future that certainly looks completely different than what we currently have,” said report co-author Hans-Otto Portner, a German climate scientist.
The Nobel Prize-winning IPCC requires that its reports be unanimously approved. Because of that, its reports tend to show less sea level rise and smaller harm than other scientific studies, outside experts said.
“Like many of the past reports, this one is conservative in the projections, especially in how much ice can be lost in Greenland and Antarctica,” said NASA oceanographer Josh Willis, who studies Greenland ice melt and wasn’t part of the report.
Willis said people should be prepared for a rise in sea levels to be twice these IPCC projections.
The world’s warm water coral reefs will go extinct in some places and be dramatically different in others, the report said.
“We are already seeing the demise of the warm water coral reefs,” Portner said. “That is one of the strongest warning signals that we have available.”
Outside scientists praised the work but were disturbed by it.
“It is alarming to read such a thorough cataloging of all of the serious changes in the planet that we’re driving,” said Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler. “What’s particularly disturbing as a scientist is that virtually all of these changes were predicted years or decades ago.”
The report’s authors emphasized that it doesn’t doom Earth to this gloomy future.
“We indicate we have a choice. Whether we go into a grim future depends on the decisions that are being made,” Portner said.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump welcomed Australia’s prime minister on Friday for only the second state visit of his administration, signaling the close bond between the two allies as Washington takes on Beijing and Tehran.
Trump and Scott Morrison are expected to discuss security and trade, as China’s increasing assertiveness, especially in the energy-rich South China Sea, has raised concerns within the region and the United States.
The leaders are also set to release a plan on Friday aimed at securing the supply of rare earth minerals, as concerns grow that China, the world’s largest processor and producer of the minerals, could cut off shipments of the prized commodities.
Days before the visit, a sign draped across the Australian Embassy in Washington proclaimed “100 years of mateship” between the two countries. On Friday, Trump feted Morrison’s arrival at the White House’s South Lawn with a 19-gun salute and US Marine Band performances of each nation’s national anthems.
“It’s highly symbolic of where the relationship sits at the moment,” said Patrick Buchan, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting that Morrison’s state visit was second only to French President Emmanuel Macron’s last year.
“Australia played a very smart game with Trump,” he added, noting the country had avoiding directly criticizing him, unlike some European counterparts.
Trump got off to a smooth start with Morrison in May, congratulating him on his surprise election victory in a tweet noting there were “no greater friends” than the United States and Australia.
The two also met on the sidelines of the G20 in June, cementing warm ties that Trump did not enjoy with Morrison’s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. Trump berated Turnbull in February 2017 over a bilateral refugee agreement before abruptly ending their telephone conversation.
Australia also agreed last month to join a coalition to protect oil tankers and cargo ships from threats posed by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz after a series of attacks there that Washington has blamed on Tehran.
Australia has also banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , the world’s top provider of telecoms equipment, from its 5G network, something the Trump administration has struggled to persuade other allies to do. The United States says Huawei’s ties to Beijing make the network equipment it sells to telecoms firms a security risk.
Australian intelligence concluded China was responsible for a cyberattack on Australia’s parliament and its three largest political parties, Reuters reported on Monday.
Following an arrival ceremony, bilateral meetings, and a joint news conference, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will host a luncheon for Morrison to be followed by a state dinner at the White House.
SECURITY AND TRADE
During a visit to Sydney last month by Pompeo and US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the United States and Australia pledged to strengthen opposition to Chinese activities in the Pacific.
China has unnerved the region and angered the United States by installing military equipment and other facilities on artificial islands it has made in the disputed South China Sea.
The United States and its Western allies also worry that China is using foreign aid to secure greater influence over small Pacific countries that control vast swath of resource-rich ocean.
Australia, traditionally the major power in the South Pacific, has promised up to A$3 billion ($2 billion) in grants and loans to counter what Washington describes as China’s “payday loan diplomacy.”
But Morrison has pressed Trump to end his trade war with China, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.

BEIJING: China expressed anger on Tuesday after German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas met prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, saying that no foreign country had a right to interfere in China’s internal affairs.
Wong met Maas on Monday in Berlin at an event hosted by the German newspaper BILD.
After being held for around 24 hours at the Hong Kong airport on Sunday for allegedly breaching the terms of his bail, Wong arrived in Berlin late on Monday evening, where he said he would “continue his battle for free elections”.
The timing is especially awkward as German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Beijing last week. Hong Kong has been gripped by weeks of protests, initially against a now-shelved extradition bill and now focused more on securing greater freedoms for Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China was “extremely dissatisfied and resolutely opposed” to German allowing Wong to visit and to allow him to meet the German foreign minister.
“China has already lodged stern representations with the German side,” Hua told a daily news briefing.
Hong Kong is an internal affair and no foreign government, organisation or individual has a right to interfere, she added.
“Any plots to rely on foreigners to build oneself up or acts or words to split the country are doomed to failure.”
Hua said that during her trip last week, Merkel clearly said that she opposes violence and supports “one country, two systems”.
Hong Kong returned to Beijing from British rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
“We can’t help but ask, what is the purpose of the German side in allowing Joshua Wong to come to Germany at this time and to meet with minister Maas?”
China urges Germany to abide by its promises and avoid sending wrong messages to separatist Hong Kong forces, and urges Maas to abide by the basics of international law and act for the benefit of relations and not be a “damager” of the relationship, Hua added.
Interference by foreign parliaments in Hong Kong‘s matters is deeply regrettable, the leader of the Chinese-ruled city said earlier on Tuesday, adding that an escalation of violence cannot solve social issues in the city.
Carrie Lam was speaking after another weekend of sometimes violent clashes in the former British colony, with police firing tear gas to disperse protesters in cat-and-mouse skirmishes, at times smashing windows and starting street fires.
Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding the autonomy they had been promised. China denies accusations of meddling in the city.

SRINAGAR: India on Sunday imposed curfews in several parts of the contested Kashmir region, after clashes between security forces and Shi’ite Muslims taking part in a procession, officials and eyewitnesses said.
At least 12 locals and six troops were injured on Saturday evening, officials told Reuters, as the worshippers on the traditional mourning procession of Muharram clashed with troops trying to stop it.
Troops used tear gas and pellet guns on the crowd, which insisted on carrying on with the procession, one in a series held at this time of the year, and pelted stones at security forces, an Indian official who declined to named told Reuters.
“The clashes continued till late night during which the troops fired tear gas and pellets,” he added.
A spokeswoman for India‘s interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
“Reasonable restrictions are necessary for peace and protection of life,” India‘s national security adviser had said on Saturday, accusing Islamabad of trying to stoke violence in the region.
Kashmir, a mountainous Muslim-majority region claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been the site of frequent altercations between security forces and locals protesting against New Delhi’s decision to revoke special rights for the portion of the territory that it controls on Aug. 5.
The most recent clashes occurred in Rainawari and Badgam, two Shi’ite majority areas of Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir’s main city.
The five km (3 mile) procession route that passes through the city centre has been barricaded by armed troops wearing helmets and bullet proof vests.
On Sunday, police vans fitted with loud speakers announced curfew-like restrictions in Srinagar’s city center Lal Chowk and adjacent areas, according to two Reuters witnesses.
“People are advised to stay indoors and not venture out of their home,” the police announced.
Suhail Ahmed, a Rainawari resident, said that there have been frequent clashes in the area for last three to four days as troops have been trying to block the procession.
“We hear deafening sounds of tear gas being fired for last few evenings. We mostly stay indoors but the gas comes into our homes making it difficult to sleep,” Ahmed said.
Muharram is the first month of the year according to the Muslim lunar calendar, and traditionally processions are held for the first 10 days of the month to observe the death of Prophet Muhammad’s nephew Imam Hussein, killed in battle in 680.
Shi’ite Muslims typically intensify their expression of suffering on the Ashura day, that this year falls on Tuesday.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests so the Chinese-ruled city can move forward from a “highly vulnerable and dangerous” place and find solutions.
Her televised announcement came after Reuters reports on Friday and Monday revealing that Beijing had thwarted an earlier proposal from Lam to withdraw the bill and that she had said privately that she would resign if she could, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters.
“Lingering violence is damaging the very foundations of our society, especially the rule of law,” a sombre Lam said as she sat wearing a navy blue jacket and pink shirt with her hands folded on a desk in front of her.
The withdrawal, a key demand of protesters but just one of five, came after unrest that drove the former British colony to the edge of anarchy as the government repeatedly refused to back down – igniting pitched battles across the city of seven million, the arrests of more than 1,000 protesters, and leaving a society deeply divided.
Many are furious about perceived police brutality and the number of arrests – 1,183 at the latest count – and want an independent inquiry.
“The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,” Lam said.
“I pledge that the government will seriously follow up the recommendations of the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Council) report. From this month, I and my principal officials will reach out to the community to start a direct dialogue … we must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions.”
The protests began in March but snowballed in June and have since evolved into a push for greater democracy for the city which returned to China in 1997.
The bill would have allowed extraditions to mainland China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
It was not immediately clear if killing the bill would help end the unrest. The immediate reaction appeared sceptical and the real test will be how many people take to the streets.
Some lawmakers said the move should have come earlier.
“The damage has been done. The scars and wounds are still bleeding,” said pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo. “She thinks she can use a garden hose to put out a hill fire. That’s not going to be acceptable.”
WINNING OVER MODERATES?
In the voice recording obtained by Reuters, Lam said at a meeting last week that her room to find a political solution to the crisis was “very limited”, as authorities in Beijing now viewed the situation as a matter of national security.
Beijing’s apparent endorsement of the withdrawal of the bill comes after the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rule since he took power in 2012.
Others said the move was not enough.
“This won’t appease the protesters,” said Boris Chen, 37, who works in financial services. “In any kind of time, people will find something they can get angry about.”
Pro-Beijing lawmaker Cheung Kwok-kwan said Lam’s announcement was not a compromise to appease those promoting violence, but a bid to win over moderates in the protest camp.
“It was likely speaking to the so-called peaceful, rational, non-violent people who were unsatisfied with the government’s response before,” he said.
One woman, Pearl, 69, said the protests were no longer about the bill.
“Some of those guys may change their minds, maybe, but just a minority,” she said of the protesters. “Some of them just want to create trouble and they will continue to do so.”
“Too little, too late,” said Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014 pro-democracy protests which were the precursor to the current unrest, on his Facebook page.
Leung Yiu-ting, president of the Hong Kong Education University student union, said the timing was wrong.
“Until the five demands are met, I don’t think the protests and the social movement will stop,” he said.
The protesters’ other four demands are: the retraction of the word “riot” to describe rallies, the release of all arrested demonstrators, an independent inquiry into the police perceived brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to democratically choose their own leaders.
The chief executive’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill’s withdrawal.
Hong Kong‘s benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped after the report of the bill’s imminent withdrawal, trading up about 4%. The property index also jumped.
Lam had said before that the bill was “dead”, but she did not withdraw it.
CHINA’S WARNINGS
Hong Kong returned to China under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system, hence the anger at the extradition bill and perceived creeping influence by Beijing.
China denies it is meddling in Hong Kong‘s affairs but warned again on Tuesday that it would not sit idly by if the unrest threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.
China has regularly denounced the protests and warned about the impact on Hong Kong‘s economy.
Cathay Pacific Airways has been one of the biggest corporate casualties.
China’s aviation regulator demanded it suspend staff from flying over its airspace if they were involved in, or supported, the demonstrations. The airline has laid off at least 20 including pilots and cabin crew.
The airline on Wednesday announced the resignation of chairman John Slosar, following the departure of CEO Rupert Hogg last month.
The unrest has shown no sign of easing.
Riot police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray – both anti-riot weapons – to clear demonstrators from outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station, with one man taken out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, television footage showed.
The police, who have repeatedly denied using excessive force, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HONG KONG: Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw global attention to their fight for greater democracy for the Chinese-ruled city which is facing its biggest political crisis in decades.
Planes were taking off and landing, with delays, but trains were suspended and approach roads to the airport impassable as protesters erected barricades and overturned trolleys at the airport and in the nearby new town of Tung Chung.
Some passengers were forced to walk the last bit of their journey to the airport by foot, dragging their luggage behind them.
The MTR subway station in Tung Chung was closed and demonstrators smashed CCTV cameras and lamps with metal poles and dismantled station turnstiles. Police appeared to be running in all directions and made several arrests.
Chek Lap Kok, built around a tiny outlying island in the dying days of British colonial rule, is one of the world’s busiest and most efficient airports, reached by a series of bridges which were packed with traffic.
“If we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong,” said one 20-year-old protester, asking not to be named.
Black-clad demonstrators targeted the airport three weeks ago, jamming the terminal in sometimes violent clashes with police and prompting some flights to be cancelled or delayed.
Police said protesters hurled iron poles, bricks and rocks on to the railway track near the airport station and trespassed on the track. By early evening protesters in the immediate vicinity of the airport had left, but protesters in Tung Chung remained.
“We have no idea how to leave. We’re stuck,” a masked protester said, as others looked for buses and ferries to get back home.
Sunday’s demonstration comes after police and protesters clashed overnight in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to the territory when it was handed back to China in 1997.
China denies the charge of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.
Tourist numbers have plummeted in recent weeks and international trade fairs cancelled as the territory faces its first recession in a decade.
China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.
Several hundred demonstrators also gathered outside the British consulate in central Hong Kong, waving Union Jack flags and chanting “God save the Queen”.
SUBWAY VIOLENCE
Parts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway on Saturday, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas. Police said they arrested 63 people aged between 13 and 36.
Amnesty International said the metro violence should be investigated.
“Violence directed at police on Saturday is no excuse for officers to go on the rampage elsewhere,” it said.
The latest protests came on the fifth anniversary of China’s decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong.
The unrest began in mid-June, fuelled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.
But the turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy.
The unrest poses the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.
Protesters have called for a general strike on Monday, but it was not immediately clear who would take part.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of efforts to restore calm and that talks with non-violent protesters would provide “a way out” for the Chinese-ruled city.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied peacefully in torrential rain on Sunday in the eleventh week of what have been often violent demonstrations.
“I sincerely hope that this was the beginning of society returning to peace and staying away from violence,” Lam said.
“We will immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue. This dialogue, I hope, will be based on a mutual understanding and respect and find a way out for today’s Hong Kong.”
Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China for trial.
The unrest has been fuelled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place after Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.
Three people were wounded, one critically, in a knife attack by an unknown assailant near a “Lennon Wall” of colourful pro-protest messages in the city’s Tseung Kwan O district in the New Territories overnight, police said. One man was arrested.
The protests have prompted sharp reactions from Beijing, which has accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest in the territory. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighbouring Shenzhen.
Britain’s Foreign Office said it was extremely concerned about reports that a Hong Kong staff member had been detained in mainland China, but there was no immediate suggestion that there was any link to the protests.
Staff member Simon Cheng did not return to work on Aug. 9 after visiting the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen the previous day, Hong Kong news website HK01 reported. China’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment. Hong Kong police did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc also said on Monday they had dismantled a state-backed social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on the Twitter and Facebook actions, but defended the right of Chinese people to make their voices heard.
Further demonstrations are planned in the next few days, including by MTR subway workers on Wednesday, secondary school students on Thursday and accountants on Friday.
The protests are exacting a toll on the city’s economy and tourism, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.
Singapore universities have cancelled exchange programmes to Hong Kong after Singapore warned its citizens to defer travel there, news website Today reported.
Singapore’s foreign ministry said in an advisory last week large protests in Hong Kong had become unpredictable and could turn violent with little or no notice.
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS
Sunday’s protest turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and protesters could be seen on Sunday night urging others to go home peacefully.
Aside from seeking Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
“The bill is dead,” Lam told Tuesday’s news briefing. “There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns.”
Police have been criticised for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
Lam said the police watchdog had set up a task force to investigate complaints.
She said she hoped Hong Kong had “unique advantages in attracting overseas companies”, stressing the rule of law, but warned of the risk of pressure on the economy which shrank 0.4% in April-June from the previous quarter.
“The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half. Actually, I think the data in the first half has not fully reflected the seriousness of the problem,” she said.
China has put strong pressure on big companies in Hong Kong over the protests, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s departure was announced by Chinese state television and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in protests.
China’s State Council called on Monday for greater development of the southern city of Shenzhen and integration of its culture and economy with neighbouring Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong is gearing up for further protests this week after hundreds of thousands of anti-government demonstrators braved heavy rain to rally peacefully on Sunday, marking a change to what have often been violent clashes.
Sunday’s massive turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the Chinese-ruled city’s airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and on Sunday night protesters could be seen urging others to go home peacefully.
Police said on Monday that while Sunday’s demonstration was mostly peaceful, there were breaches of the peace in the evening when some protesters defaced public buildings and aimed laser beams at officers.
It was a far cry from the violent clashes between protesters and riot police throughout the summer, with activists storming the legislature and targeting China’s main Liaison Office in the city. The weekend was also noteworthy for a lack of tear gas use by police.
The protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. They have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China, including an independent judiciary, but many in the city believe Beijing has been eroding those freedoms.
Aside from Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
One protester, speaking at a “citizen’s press conference” on Monday, was asked what path the protests would take now, peaceful or violent.
“We have started our rallies very peacefully but after two and a half months it seems that the Hong Kong government has not responded to our five demands so one thing leads to another and it may cause escalation,” the speaker, named Wang, said.
“If you ask me, I personally hope there will be a quick resolution to this from the government so we don’t have to protest any more.”
On Sunday, protesters spilling out from Victoria Park, the designated rally area on Hong Kong island, streamed onto major thoroughfares towards the city’s financial centre, chanting for Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam to step down.
Police estimated the size of the crowd in Victoria Park at 128,000 at its peak, although that excludes the masses of umbrella-carrying demonstrators who packed the streets.
CHINESE FORCES ACROSS THE BORDER
The Hong Kong government said in a statement on Sunday night it was important to restore social order as soon as possible and that it would begin talks with the public and “rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down”.
The Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, attributed the change in the character of Sunday’s protest to the presence of Chinese paramilitary forces, which have been conducting exercises in Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong.
“This was widely seen as a stern warning to the violent elements in Hong Kong,” it said, adding that a backlash from Hong Kong residents over last week’s airport occupations was another factor.
The Chinese Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper warned again in an editorial on Monday that hostile foreign influences were inciting the protest movement. Beijing has accused some countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest.
US President Donald Trump hinted on Sunday that the White House would like to see Beijing resolve the protests before the world’s two largest economies could reach a trade deal.
“I would like to see Hong Kong worked out in a very humanitarian fashion,” Trump said. “I think it would be very good for the trade deal.”
Further demonstrations are planned in coming weeks, including protests planned by Christians and even an accountants’ group.
Police have come under criticism for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations, but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
The central government has sought to deepen integration between the mainland and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and nearby Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave which returned to China in 1999. The State Council called on Monday for greater development of the so-called Greater Bay Area and to enrich the “one country, two systems” policy.
China has also put strong pressure on big companies, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s sudden departure was announced by Chinese state television on Friday and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in the protests.
Shares in Cathay rose more than 2% early on Monday before paring gains to be down 0.6%. Jeffries analysts wrote in a note on Monday that it maintained its “buy” rating on Cathay and that it expected the company to remain profitable.

KATHMANDU: Nepal must make training and experience in high altitude climbing mandatory for all climbers on Mount Everest and other high peaks, a government panel said on Wednesday, following the deadliest climbing season in four years.
Eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the 8,850 metre (29,035 feet) mountain in May – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side.
The Nepali panel – made up of government officials, climbing experts and agencies representing the climbing community – was set up after climbers and guides criticised officials after the deaths for allowing anyone who paid $11,000 to climb Everest.
Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Everest, and mountain climbing is a key source of employment and income for the cash strapped nation.
But the numbers attempting the climb in May led to crowding in the so-called death zone, where there are very low oxygen levels. That put lives at risk as oxygen cylinders ran out while up to 100 people waited in the queue.
Nepal issued 381 permits for Everest for this year’s climbing season, which tends to culimate in May, when the daylight and weather is the most forgiving.
“Climbers to Sagarmatha and other 8,000 metre mountains must undergo basic and high altitude climbing training,” the panel said in a report submitted to the government, referring to the Nepali name of Mount Everest.
The report said those hoping to climb Everest must climb at least one Nepali peak above 6,500 metres before getting a permit. Climbers must also submit a certificate of good health and physical fitness, and be accompanied by a trained Nepali guide, it said.
Ghanshyam Upadhyaya, a senior Tourism Ministry official, said the recommendations would be implemented.
“The government will now make the required changes in laws and regulations guiding mountain climbing,” he told Reuters.
Mira Acharya, a member of the panel said “climbers died due to altitude sickness, heart attack, exhaustion or weaknesses and not due to traffic jams”.
She said the compulsory provision of guides for each climber was to discourage solo attempts which put lives at risk.
A reliable weather forecasting system should be in place and rope fixing should be done in time, giving enough space for the climbers to use a window of good weather to reach the summit, the report said.

HONG KONG: Flights leaving Hong Kong were disrupted for a second day on Tuesday, plunging the former British colony deeper into turmoil as its stockmarket fell to a seven-month low, and its leader said it had been pushed into a state of “panic and chaos”.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also urged Hong Kong to exercise restraint and investigate evidence of its forces firing tear gas at protesters in ways banned under international law.
Ten weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and protesters have roiled the Asian financial hub as thousands of residents chafe at a perceived erosion of freedoms and autonomy under Chinese rule.
China this week condemned some protesters for using dangerous tools to attack police, calling the clashes “sprouts of terrorism”. They present President Xi Jinping with one of his biggest challenges since he came to power in 2012.
Hong Kong legal experts say Beijing might be paving the way to use anti-terror laws to try to quell the demonstrations.
Check-in operations were suspended at 4.30 pm on Tuesday, a day after an unprecedented airport shutdown, as thousands of black-clad protesters jammed the terminal, chanting, singing and waving banners.
“Take a minute to look at our city, our home,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said, her voice cracking, at a news conference in the government headquarters complex, which is fortified behind 6-foot (1.8-m) -high water-filled barricades.
“Can we bear to push it into the abyss and see it smashed to pieces?”
The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed suspects’ extradition to mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy.
At the airport, thousands of protesters gathered in the arrivals hall, as well as some parts of departures, using luggage trolleys to blockade the doors to customs checkpoints.
Floors and walls were covered with missives penned by activists and other artwork. The scene was peaceful as knots of protesters spoke to travellers, explaining their aims.
“Sorry for the inconvenience, we are fighting for the future of our home,” read one protest banner at the airport.
“I think paralysing the airport will be effective in forcing Carrie Lam to respond to us … it can further pressure Hong Kong’s economy,” said Dorothy Cheng, 17.
Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997.
They want Lam to resign. She says she will stay.
“My responsibility goes beyond this particular range of protest,” she said, adding that violence had pushed the territory into a state of “panic and chaos”.
As she spoke, the benchmark Hang Seng index hit a seven-month low. It shed more than 2%, dragging down markets across Asia.
Lam did not respond to questions at a press briefing to clarify if she had the power to withdraw the extradition bill and satisfy a key demand made by the protesters, or if she needed Beijing’s approval.
AIRPORT DISRUPTED
Airport authorities had earlier suspended check-in operations as the fifth day of a sit-in by protesters grew increasingly heated. Crowds continued to swell in the evening.
“Terminal operations at Hong Kong International Airport have been seriously disrupted as a result of the public assembly,” the airport authority said.
Some passengers challenged protesters over the delays as tempers began to fray, while the demonstrators, using a Chinese term of encouragement, chanted, “Hong Kong people – add oil!”
Flag carrier Cathay Pacific warned: “There is potential for further flight disruptions at short notice.”
The airline, whose British heritage makes it a symbol of Hong Kong’s colonial past, is also in a political bind.
China’s civil aviation regulator demanded that the airline suspend staff who joined or backed the protests from flights in its airspace, pushing the carrier’s shares past Monday’s 10-year low.
Other Chinese airlines have offered passengers wanting to avoid Hong Kong a free switch to nearby destinations, such as Guangzhou, Macau, Shenzhen or Zhuhai, with the disruption sending shares in Shenzhen Airport Co Ltd surging.
On Monday China said the protests had reached a critical juncture, after a weekend of street clashes in which both police and protesters appeared to toughen their resolve.
Police fired tear gas at the blackshirted crowds in districts on Hong Kong island, Kowloon and the New Territories.

HONG KONG/BEIJING: China’s aviation regulator on Friday demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend personnel who have engaged in illegal protests in the city from staffing flights into its airspace from August 10.
Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Last week, a Cathay pilot was among over 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.
On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said that Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website.
The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights.
Crew members that have not gained the authority’s approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations.
The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.
In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: “We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly.”
“The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific. There is zero tolerance for any inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour that may affect aviation safety. We deal with these incidents very seriously.”
Cathay said on Thursday it respects “everyone’s right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner,” while insisting it “recognises that Hong Kong SAR is a part of China”.
“We do not condone any activities that jeopardise the stability of Hong Kong,” it said.
On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights.
Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respects its staff’s opinions.
“We certainly wouldn’t dream of telling them what they have to think about something. They’re all adults, they’re all service professionals. We respect them greatly,” he said.
Global Times, published by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, ran news stories this week highlighting Cathay employees’ participation in the ongoing protests.
Embattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam on Friday urged an end to the violence, claiming that the protests are dragging on the city’s economy.
Hong Kong-listed Cathay is 45% owned by Swire Pacific and 22.7% held by Air China , according to Refinitiv Eikon.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Wednesday it would expel India’s ambassador and suspend bilateral trade with its arch-rival after New Delhi stripped its portion of the contested Kashmir region of special status.
Neighbours China and Pakistan, which both claim parts of the region, have voiced fierce opposition to India’s move dropping a constitutional provision that had allowed the country’s only Muslim-majority state to make its own laws.
Moin-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s newly-appointed ambassador to India, had yet to take up his post but will now not move to New Delhi, while Indian Ambassador Ajay Bisaria will be expelled, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a telephone interview with Pakistani TV channel ARY News.
“It is very obvious that our ambassador wouldn’t be in Delhi, and obviously the man who is here will also leave,” Qureshi said.
Earlier Pakistan’s National Security Committee, a panel of top government and military officials chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, said it would implement a range of measures over what it called India’s “illegal” decision to revoke Kashmir’s special status.
That includes “downgrading of diplomatic relations with India” and a further review of bilateral arrangements between the two countries, a committee statement said, without elaborating further.
Qureshi told Pakistan’s parliament on Wednesday the country was consulting with China regarding Kashmir and that he might fly to Beijing for discussions with officials there.
A spokesman for India’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ISLAMABAD/MUZAFFARABAD: Pakistan said on Tuesday it was considering further diplomatic and military pressure on India after the Hindu-majority nation stripped its portion of contested Kashmir of special status.
India on Monday dropped a constitutional provision for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which has long been a flashpoint in ties with neighbouring Pakistan, to make its own laws.
Nuclear arch-rivals India and Pakistan both claim Muslim-majority Kashmir in full but rule it in part. They have fought two wars over the territory and came close to a third this year after a car bomb set off by a Pakistan-based militant group killed dozens of Indian paramilitary police.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday India’s removal of special status for Kashmir, which included prohibiting outsiders from owning property, was an attempt to alter the demographics of the region and was illegal under international law.
“We will fight it at every forum. We’re thinking how we can take it to International Court (of Justice)… to the United Nations Security Council,” Khan said in an address to Pakistan’s parliament.
Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, accusing India of violating Security Council resolutions on Kashmir.
Qureshi is returning early from the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as a result of the crisis, the foreign ministry said.
India maintains its actions in Kashmir are legal both under domestic and international law.
Earlier on Tuesday, Pakistan’s army chief said the country’s military will “go to any extent” to support people in the region.
“Pakistan Army firmly stands by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end,” said General Qamar Javed Bajwa after meeting with top commanders in Rawalpindi.
“We are prepared and shall go to any extent to fulfil our obligations in this regard,” he added, without elaborating further.
BUSINESS SHUTDOWN
In Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir around 45km (28 miles) from the contested border between the neighbours, protests continued for a second day with hundreds of people including children shouting anti-India slogans.
In the Neelum Valley, which sits on the border and has seen heavy shelling between the two countries in recent weeks, there was a shutdown of shops and businesses in protest at India’s decision.
Many people in Kashmir have relatives on both sides of the border, but people on the Pakistani side say they have been unable to contact those in India for several days after New Delhi restricted internet and phone access.
Tanveer-ul-Islam migrated from India to Muzaffarabad in 1990. His family, including his elderly mother and siblings, live in the Badgam district of Indian Kashmir, but he said he has been unable to contact them for two days.
“My day does not begin until I speak to my mother, but I have not been able to talk to her (since) Aug 4. You can’t even imagine my pain,” he said. “We do not know about the well being of anyone across the divide”.
His wife Haleema Akhtar, whose family is in Magam in Indian-administered Kashmir, said she was also unable to contact them.
“I called my daughter and son-in-law in the US to try to contact them, but they too expressed helplessness in the face of the clampdown on communication,” she said.

HONG KONG: Police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong on Sunday after violent clashes a day earlier, and Beijing said it would not let the situation persist.
The Chinese-controlled city has been rocked by months of protests against a proposed bill to allow people to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China and they have now grown into calls for greater democracy.
A general strike aimed at bringing the city, an Asian financial hub, to a halt is planned for Monday.
After the peaceful demonstrations finished, hundreds of masked protesters blocked roads in the town of Tseung Kwan O in the New Territories, set up barricades and hurled hard objects, including bricks at a police station.
Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters after a separate rally in the island’s Western district where thousands of people gathered to urge authorities to listen to public demands.
Protesters had began a march towards China’s Liaison Office which has been a flashpoint at previous protests.
Police said the protesters were “participating in an unathorised assembly”, similar to Saturday when they fired multiple tear gas rounds in confrontations with black-clad activists in the Kowloon area.
Police said they had arrested more than 20 people for offences overnight including unlawful assembly and assault. The protests have become the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule 22 years ago after being governed by Britain since 1842. China’s official news agency Xinhua said on Sunday: “Central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue. We firmly believe that Hong Kong will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges ahead.”
During the day protesters had marched brandishing coloured leaflets, called for a mass strike across Hong Kong on Monday and shouted “Restore Hong Kong” and “Revolution of our time.”
“We’re trying to tell the government to (withdraw) the extradition bill and to police to stop the investigations and the violence,” said Gabriel Lee, a 21-year-old technology student.
Lee said what made him most angry was that the government was not responding to any of the protesters’ demands or examining the police violence.
What started as an angry response to the now suspended extradition bill, has expanded to demands for greater democracy and the resignation of leader Carrie Lam.
“Even if Carrie Lam resigns, its still not resolved. It’s all about the Communist Party, the Chinese government,” said Angie, a 24-year-old working for a non-government organisation.
Protesters on Saturday set fires in the streets, outside a police station and in rubbish bins, and blocked the entrance to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon peninsula.
Shops in the tourist and commercial area Nathan Road, normally packed on a Saturday, were shuttered including 7-11 convenience stores, jewellery chain Chow Tai Fook and watch brands Rolex and Tudor.
Thousands of civil servants joined in the anti-government protests on Friday for the first time since they started in June, defying a warning from authorities to remain politically neutral.
PROTEST TACTICS
The protests have adapted rapidly since the start of June with the movement spreading from the Admiralty area, where the legislative council is located, across to the whole city for the first time.
Previous protests have also targeted mainland visitors to try and make them understand the situation in what is officially termed a Special Administrative Region of China.
Young people have mostly been at the forefront of the protests, infuriated with broader problems including sky-high living costs and what they see as an unfair housing policy skewed towards the rich.
However, the demonstrations have seen people of all ages, including families and the elderly take part.
The protests mark the biggest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took office in 2012.
Hong Kong has been allowed to retain extensive freedoms, such as an independent judiciary but many residents see the extradition bill as the latest step in a relentless march toward mainland control.
Months of demonstrations are taking a growing toll on the city’s economy, as local shoppers and tourists avoid parts of one of the world’s most famous shopping destinations.
Matthew Wang, a 22-year-old marketing executive for a multinational corporation, said that the government was “encouraging people to become more radical to affect decision making because they are not addressing any of the demands.”

184,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/us-believes-osama-bin-ladens-son-hamza-is-dead-official/,"NEW YORK: The United States believes that Hamza bin Laden, a son of slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and himself a notable figure in the militant group, is dead, a US official said on Wednesday.
The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, provided no further details, including when Hamza died or where.
President Donald Trump earlier on Wednesday declined to comment after NBC News first reported the US assessment. Asked if he had intelligence that bin Laden’s son had been killed, Trump told reporters: “I don’t want to comment on it.”
Separately, the White House declined comment on whether any announcement was imminent.
Hamza, believed to be about 30 years old, was at his father’s side in Afghanistan before the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and spent time with him in Pakistan after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan pushed much of al Qaeda’s senior leadership there, according to the Brookings Institution.
Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces who raided his compound in Pakistan in 2011. Hamza was thought to be under house arrest in Iran at the time, and documents recovered from the compound indicated that aides had been trying to reunite him with his father.
The New York Times reported that the United States had a role in the operation that led to Hamza’s death, which it said took place in the past two years. Reuters could not immediately verify those details.
Still, the US government’s conclusion appears to be a recent one. In February, the State Department said it was offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading “to the identification or location in any country” of Hamza, calling him a key al Qaeda leader.
Introduced by al Qaeda’s chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio message in 2015, Hamza provided a younger voice for the group whose ageing leaders have struggled to inspire militants around the world galvanized by Islamic State, according to analysts.
Hamza has called for acts of terrorism in Western capitals and threatened to take revenge against the United States for his father’s killing, the US State Department said in 2017 when it designated him as a global terrorist.
He also threatened to target Americans abroad and urged tribal groups in Saudi Arabia to unite with Yemen’s al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to fight against Saudi Arabia, it said.
In March, Saudi Arabia announced it had stripped Hamza bin Laden of his citizenship, saying the decision was made by a royal order in November 2018.

KUALA LUMPUR: An undocumented domestic worker has the right to pursue her claim for unpaid wages in Malaysia, a court has ruled, setting a legal precedent migrant rights groups said would help protect human trafficking survivors.
In a landmark ruling this week, a high court in Malaysia said an Indonesian domestic worker who was not paid for nearly five years can pursue her case after it was dismissed earlier by labour authorities because she did not have a work permit.
“This is a precedent for all undocumented workers,” Glorene Das, executive director at the Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Tuesday.
“With this precedent, there is hope for undocumented workers to seek redress in court. They are workers who have been exploited in trafficked and forced labour situations,” she said by phone.
Malaysia relies heavily on foreign workers in areas such as manufacturing, domestic work and on plantations, hosting millions of migrant labourers from countries such as Indonesia, Nepal and Bangladesh.
But many of them are victims of human trafficking who were duped by brokers with promises of lucrative pay, often arriving without a valid work permit, and then suffer abuses later.
The Indonesian woman, who is in her 20s and whose name was withheld by Tenaganita for privacy reasons, fled to the group’s shelter in 2017. Tenaganita helped her file the legal case over unpaid wages.
She sought about 30,000 Malaysian ringgit ($7,300) in unpaid wages at the government’s labour department and then a labour court, but both rejected her case.
She lodged an appeal with a high court last year, which ruled on Monday that it was “premature” for the claim to be thrown out based on the work permit status, according to Tenaganita and the Malaysiakini news website.
The court also ordered the case to be fully heard.
“All I want is my wages that I have worked for, so that I can go home to my family,” the Indonesian woman said in a statement provided by Tenaganita.
The high court and the labour department could not be reached on Tuesday due to a public holiday.
Indonesia and Cambodia, key sources of migrant workers to Malaysia, have in the past temporarily banned their citizens from going to work in Malaysia as maids after cases of abuse.
Malaysia has said this year that it was ready to “declare war” on human trafficking and forced labour, with a review of labour laws was underway.
The U.S. State Department’s 2019 Trafficking in Persons report put Malaysia in its Tier 2 Watch List – the second-lowest ranking – for not meeting the minimum standards in efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

186,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/bushfires-rage-out-of-control-across-southeast-australia/,"SYDNEY/MELBOURNE: Bushfires burned dangerously out of control on Australia‘s east coast on Saturday, fanned by high temperatures and strong winds that had firefighters battling to save lives and property, as a change in wind conditions merged several large fire fronts.
By late evening, Victoria had 14 fires rated at emergency or evacuate warning levels, and New South Wales had 11 rated emergency, with more than 150 others burning across the states. New fires had started, and others had broken containment lines.
“There are a number of fires that are coming together – very strong, very large, intense fires that are creating some of these fire-generated thunderstorms,” New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said at an evening briefing.
“And unfortunately we’ve still got many hours to go off these elevated and dangerous conditions.”
The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said conditions were deteriorating rapidly as a gusty southerly wind change pushed up the coast and smoke plumes from the fires triggered storms.
Authorities are worried the fires could turn out to be worse than New Year’s Eve, when they burnt massive tracts of bushland and forced thousands of residents and summer holidaymakers to seek refuge on beaches.
In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews said while conditions were difficult, the job of firefighters had been made easier by tens of thousands of people following advice to evacuate.
It may be Sunday or later before damage assessments can be made. Prime Minister Scott Morrison put the national death toll from the current fire season, which began in September, at 23. Twelve of those are from this week’s fires alone.
In updates, the NSW RFS repeatedly delivered the same blunt advice to those who had not evacuated at-risk areas: “It is too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches.”
Residents used social media to post photos of the sky turning black and red from the smoke and glare of the fires, including in the Victorian town of Mallacoota, where around 1,000 people were evacuated by sea on Friday.
The first of those evacuees arrived near Melbourne on Saturday morning after a 20-hour journey by boat and a second ship with about 1,000 people landed in the afternoon.
The federal government announced an unprecedented call up of army reservists to support firefighters as well other resources including a third navy ship equipped for disaster and humanitarian relief.
Andy Gillham, the incident controller in the Victorian town of Bairnsdale, said the area had avoided the worst of the fires on Saturday but stressed this was an exceptional fire season.
“In a normal year, we would start to see the fire season kick off in a big way around early January and we’re already up towards a million hectares of burnt country. This is a marathon event and we expect to be busy managing these fires for at least the next eight weeks,” he said.
Following are highlights of what is happening across Australia:

Temperatures topped 45C (113F) in much of the Sydney metropolitan area, with Penrith recording a high of 48.9C (120F) according to the BOM. Canberra, the national capital, recorded a temperature of 44C just after 4 pm, which the chief minister said was a record for the territory.
As the fires have flared, many towns have been isolated as major and minor roads are closed. Some fires are generating their own storm systems, which create the risk of lightning strikes generating new fires.
A late southerly wind change on Saturday dramatically lowered temperatures but also brought wind gusts of 70-80 km per hour (43-50 miles per hour) that caused some major fires near the border of Victoria and New South Wales states to merge and strengthen.
In South Australia, two people died on Kangaroo Island, a popular holiday spot not far off the coast. South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said more than 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) have burned there, about one-quarter of the total area.
Six people remain unaccounted for in Victoria, Premier Andrews said on Saturday, down from 28 reported on Friday.
The focus on Saturday is preventing more loss of life, authorities said. National parks have been closed and people urged earlier this week to evacuate large parts of NSW’s south coast and Victoria’s northeastern regions, magnets for holidaymakers at the peak of Australia‘s summer school holidays.
Morrison confirmed that his visit to India and Japan scheduled for mid-January had been postponed due to the fires.
More than 5.25 million hectares (13 million acres) of land has been burnt this fire season.

187,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/after-indonesias-deadly-floods-few-hear-climate-wake-up-call/,"
JAKARTA: Floods that killed more than 50 people in Indonesia’s capital after the biggest rainfall since records began should be a wake-up call to climate change in one of the world’s biggest carbon emitters, environmental groups said.
But, despite the catastrophe in Southeast Asia’s biggest city, authorities see no greater impetus for more cuts to planned carbon dioxide emission reductions or other measures to address climate change.

The floods “should serve as a strong reminder to the government that things can’t be business as usual,” said Yuyun Harmono, a campaign manager at the Indonesian Forum for the Environment, the country’s biggest green group.
With one of the world’s longest coastlines Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, is extremely vulnerable to climate change. The metropolitan region of the capital Jakarta is home to 30 million people and parts of the city near the coast are sinking just as sea levels are rising.
However, the country is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of the greenhouse gases that are blamed for causing the climate crisis. It is also the world’s top exporter of both thermal coal and palm oil, whose cultivation has reduced the amount of carbon dioxide absorbing forests.
At least 53 people were killed after the rains on New Year’s Day, Indonesian authorities said on Saturday. Nearly 175,000 people remain evacuated from their homes.
Indonesia’s meteorological department said it was the heaviest one-day rainfall since Dutch colonists began keeping records in 1866 and squarely blamed rising global temperatures.
“The impact of a one degree increase can be severe,” Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of the agency, told a news conference on Friday. “Among that is these floods.”
The floods were “a big wake up call,” said Hidayah Hamzah, a research analyst at the World Resources environmental group in Jakarta.
“WE DON’T CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT”
Social media users criticised the government for not doing enough on climate change after the flooding. Twitter user @wolfiecoconut said: “Indonesia is a country that is prone to disaster but we don’t care about the environment.”
But the green lobby has little sway in Indonesia.
Only 18% of Indonesians believe there is a link between human activity and climate change, according to a 2019 survey, the smallest percentage among the world’s 23 biggest countries.
When asked if the government would do more on climate issues after the floods, the Ministry of the Environment and Forest’s Climate Adaptation Director Sri Tantri Arundhati said on Friday there are no plans to change policy or shift the targets for cutting carbon dioxide output it agreed under the Paris Accord.
Rida Mulyana, director general for electricity at the energy ministry, said the government would stick to a plan for moving to renewables that means more than half of power generation will still rely on coal for the next decade.
Part of the government’s solution for Jakarta’s regular floods, which are not usually as bad as the recent ones, is to move the capital to the island of Borneo by 2023, a plan environmentalists fear will exacerbate deforestation.
Plans to improve Jakarta’s flood defences include building two dams and works on the city’s biggest river.
“There aren’t a lot of people who realize the impact of climate change,” said Nirwono Joga, a researcher at the Urban Studies Center in Jakarta.
“When the flood recedes and people get back to their homes and resume normal activities, flood management or concrete actions to combat climate change will be forgotten too.”

188,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/food/golden-globes-will-serve-plant-based-meal-at-awards-ceremony/,"LOS ANGELES: The Golden Globes, known as the “party of the year,” is going with a meatless menu for its 77th annual awards show.
Guests will be served a 100% plant-based meal just ahead of showtime Sunday. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association said Thursday that it wants the initiative to raise environmental awareness about food consumption and waste.

“If there’s a way we can, not change the world, but save the planet, maybe we can get the Golden Globes to send a signal and draw attention to the issue about climate change,” HFPA president Lorenzo Soria said. “The food we eat, the way we grow the food we eat, the way we dispose of the food is one of the large contributors to the climate crisis.”
The annual awards ceremony will air on NBC from The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California.
Soria said there was some initial push back about changing the menu just about two weeks before the show, but the hotel eventually agreed on the new menu.
“People were basically saying it’s too late, we’re ready with all the orders, the holidays and all that,” he said. “But after we began discussions, meeting for one or two days, (the hotel) accepted the change completely. They started to experiment with how to do plant-based meals that was not just their symbolic steps, but also something that guests will enjoy.”
Matthew Morgan, executive chef at The Beverly Hilton, called the menu change initially surprising. But he ultimately understood it would send a positive message.
“It was a little shocking when first mentioned, because of being very close to the actual Globes and having already decided on a menu,” he said. “But once we thought about it and the message that it sent, we were really excited about it. That’s something I stand behind myself.”
Items on the main entree include king oyster mushrooms scallops and wild mushroom risotto, along with roasted baby purple and green Brussels sprouts and carrots. A chilled golden beet soup will be served as an appetizer.
HFPA partnered with Icelandic Glacial, a naturally alkaline and sustainably-sourced natural spring water. The water will be served in glass bottles to eliminate plastic waste in the ballroom and red carpet, which is reused at other events throughout the year.
Soria called the food “excellent” after a recent taste-testing.
Morgan said making the change wasn’t too difficult. He said the first course was already vegan and the main course was a vegan alternate in which they enhanced the dish to add some “pop and color to the plate.”

After more than 60 years spent sealed up in a library storage facility, about 1,000 letters written by poet T.S. Eliot to confidante Emily Hale will be unveiled this week, and scholars hope they will reveal the extent of a relationship that’s been speculated about for decades.
Many consider Hale to not only be his close friend, but also his muse, and they hope their correspondence will offer insight into the more intimate details about Eliot’s life and work. Students, researchers and scholars can read the letters at Princeton University Library starting Thursday.
In this Oct. 14, 2019, photo, letters between poet T.S. Eliot and longtime confidante Emily Hale are displayed in Princeton, N.J. Thursday, Jan. 2, 2020 marks the first day that students, researchers and scholars can go to the Ivy League school in New Jersey to see these letters that many are saying may reveal more intimate details about Eliot’s life and work.

“I think it’s perhaps the literary event of the decade,” says Anthony Cuda, an Eliot scholar and director of the T.S. Eliot International Summer School. “I don’t know of anything more awaited or significant. It’s momentous to have these letters coming out.”
Lifelong friends, Hale and Eliot exchanged letters for about 25 years beginning in 1930. The two met in 1912 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but did not rekindle their friendship until 1927. Eliot was already living in England and Hale taught drama at U.S. universities, including Scripps College in California.
In 1956, Hale donated the letters under an agreement they wouldn’t be opened until 50 years after either her or Eliot’s death, whichever came second. Eliot died in 1965. Hale died four years later.
Biographers say Eliot ordered Hale’s letters to him to be burned.
Their relationship “must have been incredibly important and their correspondence must have been remarkably intimate for him to be so concerned about the publication,” Cuda says.
T.S. Eliot was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1888 and gained notoriety as a poet early in life. He was only 26 when “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” became his first professionally published poem.
Eliot’s 1939 book of whimsical poetry, “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats,” was adapted into “Cats,” the award-winning musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The play opened in London first in 1981 and then on Broadway the next year. It was then turned into a feature film starring an ensemble cast that includes Judi Dench and James Corden just released in December.
His best known works include “The Waste Land,” “The Hollow Men” and “Four Quartets.”
The first poem in the “Quartets” series, called “Burnt Norton,” piques the interest of enthusiasts of the poet, says Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, because of lines that suggest missed opportunities and what might have been with his muse. The poem is named after a home in England that Eliot visited with Hale in 1934.
“His relationship with her seems to be deep and meaningful and it’s a door he chose not to open,” she said.
The letters could also reveal details about Eliot’s conversion to Anglicanism, something he deeply cherished, Dickey says.
Dickey, who served as one of the editors on “The Complete Prose of T.S. Eliot”, said the poet was deeply ashamed of his marriage to his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, whom he was with for more than 15 years. Dickey said the letters could reveal just how close he and Hale were and if the two ever considered marriage.
“Was this an epistolary romance they would carry across the Atlantic?” Dickey said. “What role did she play in his emotional life?”
Eliot’s letters to Hale began after that first marriage ended. Whatever else she was, Hale was a link to the life Eliot had left behind in the United States as a young man, Dickey said.
“He was really thinking more about the United States and his childhood during the period where he was in correspondence with Hale,” says Dickey. “I have a feeling that having a relationship with an American woman helped him to uncover his past in a way.”
The unsealed boxes, which also contain photographs, clippings and other ephemera, were actually opened at the library’s special collections area called Firestone Library in October for cataloging and digitizing. Daniel Linke, interim head of special collections at the library, was part of the team working on the 14 boxes. He said there was very minimal, if any, reading.
He said that scholars from around the world will be traveling to Princeton in the first days they are available since they are copyrighted and won’t be made available online.
“It will be the special collections equivalent of a stampede at a rock concert,” Linke said.

190,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/physical-activity-linked-to-sperm-quality/,"





Healthy young men who exercise regularly may have better quality semen than their sedentary peers, a study of sperm donors suggests.
Even though being overweight and sedentary has long been tied to low sex drive and an increased risk of infertility, less is known about how physical activity levels might impact semen quality among men without fertility issues, the study team notes in Human Reproduction.










For the current analysis, researchers analyzed thousands of sperm samples from hundreds of men who qualified to donate sperm based on their health history and semen quality. Donors needed healthy levels of three things that can make conception more likely: sperm concentration, or the amount of sperm released when men ejaculate; sperm morphology, meaning the ideal size and shape with an oval head and a long tail; and motility, or the ability of sperm to move through the female reproductive tract to reach an egg.
Men who got the most total exercise and logged the most time doing intense workouts had better sperm motility than men who got the least amounts of exercise, the study found.
“Regular exercise may improve semen quality parameters among healthy, non-infertile men,” said study co-author Dr. Yi-Xin Wang of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in Boston.
“But it’s hard to tell how much exercise, and how often and what type of workouts should men do for optimal fertility,” Wang said by email.
All of the 746 study participants volunteered as potential sperm donors at the Hubei Province Human Sperm Bank in China. They were 28 years old, on average, and had a healthy weight, at least a high school education, no sexually transmitted diseases and no history of radiation exposure.
Researchers asked participants how often they exercised, and how intensely, as well as what other activities they did. Then, the study team scored participants’ exercise levels and intensity based on a measure known as metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week.
Light activities like walking or housework earn fewer points toward the total MET minutes per week than intense workouts like running or cycling.
Overall, half of the men in the study got at least 2,245.5 MET minutes a week. The least active men got only around 526.5 MET minutes, while the most active men got about 7,082.3 MET minutes.
While higher MET levels were associated with increased sperm motility, the men’s sperm concentration and morphology didn’t appear to vary based on how much exercise they got.
The amount of time men spent in sedentary pursuits like working at a computer or watching television also didn’t appear to impact any parameters of semen quality.
One drawback of the study is that it only measured activity levels at a single point in time. Another limitation is that researchers only focused on healthy men who were eligible to donate sperm.
Some previous research also suggests that excessive exercise is associated with infertility, said Dr. Muhammad Imran Omar, a researcher at the University of Aberdeen in the UK who wasn’t involved in the study.
“Therefore, it is important that the exercise should be done in moderation,” Omar said by email.
Even though the study didn’t find sedentary time associated with lower quality sperm, sitting too much is associated with other health problems like diabetes, obesity and heart disease that can in turn make it harder for couples to conceive, said Dr. Joan Khoo of Changi General Hospital in Singapore.
People who want to conceive should still try to limit sedentary time, Khoo, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.
“If your job is mostly sedentary, take every opportunity to get out of the chair or vehicle; stand, walk or climb stairs whenever you can,” Khoo advised. “Park the car some distance away or get down one bus stop earlier, and exercise as much as possible when not at work.”

191,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/as-lights-dance-sensorio-artist-sees-nature-people-interact/,"PASO ROBLES, CALIFORNIA: It’s an art installation, sure. But the internationally acclaimed artist who created the interactive work “Field of Light at Sensorio” in California sees it as much more than that.
It is, says Bruce Munro, a conduit of sorts allowing its viewer to better commune with nature when taking in “Sensorio’s” 58,000 shimmering, flower-like lights that have been painstakingly installed over 15 acres (6 hectares) of pristine pasture in the heart of central California wine country.

“I don’t want to sound like some kind of ancient hippie because I’m not,” the 60-year-old British artist says with a laugh as he discusses his latest — and largest — light exhibition.
When the sun sets behind the rolling hills on the edge of the small picturesque town of Paso Robles, and the lights come on, Munro says he senses a kind of tranquil peace settling over the hundreds of people who come each night to walk the hills and valleys bathed in his creation’s gentle but colorful illumination.
“It almost is a lens to see the landscape that you’re in,” he said. “The landscape — nature — really does help us find a balance in our lives
“We all are leading incredibly busy lives,” he continues. “Busier than ever and with more screen time. And this is really an opportunity to get off screen, to get back into the real world. You know, to smell the cut grass, the fresh air. … Or whatever. And be a part of it.”
Munro has been putting up light-centric installations around the world for 15 years and is sometimes compared to the environmental artist Christo, whose most famous work is likely “Running Fence,” the 25 miles (40 kilometers) of colorful fabric he and his late wife and fellow artist, Jeanne-Claude, stretched from central California to the Pacific Ocean in the 1970s.
Munro’s “Field of Light” works vary in appearance from sculptures to garden rooms to everyday objects that reflect light. His most famous, at least until now, is likely “Field of Light at Uluru,” located in the red rock desert of Australia, a region considered sacred to the aboriginal people.
Fourteen years in the planning, it opened in 2016 for a brief run that has since been extended indefinitely.
It is similar to “Sensorio” but smaller, made up of 50,000 colorful, solar-powered twinkling orbs. The artist insists that had nothing to do with his trying to outdo himself by putting his largest work to date in California.
“Size is relevant to the landscape it inhabits,” he said. “I don’t put lights in to make bigger and bigger installations.”
At “Sensorio,” viewers see lights from numerous perspectives, including above and below, as they stroll the dirt paths bathed in softly lit colors. The result is a feeling of immersion in a world of quiet yet beautiful tranquility.
The exhibition, initially scheduled to close in January, has been extended through June, as its sponsors say more than 110,000 people from 41 countries have flocked to see it. Evening viewings often sell out ahead of time.
When it does close, Munro says, future visitors will hardly know it was there.
“Part of the reason we wanted to do solar is because there is no infrastructure that needs to be dug in,” he said. “Ëverything is on the surface. When its time does go to disappear, and the landscape comes back, the existing landscape or something else that goes there, its footprint will be very minimal.”
Meantime, the artist will move on to his next project. He’s been busy sketching out something called “C-Scales,” in which he hopes to create an image of the ocean “shedding its scales” into the air through the reflection of light upon thousands of old CDs and DVDs. He says the idea was inspired by gazing at Australia’s Sydney Harbor.
Noting he recently turned 60, Munro reasons if he stays in good health he’ll have the time to bring that and perhaps several other creations to the public.
“The trouble is it all comes too late, doesn’t it?” he says, chuckling as he discusses the ideas he constantly fills his sketchbook with.
“You spend half your life not realizing all these ideas are spinning around in your head, and then suddenly the penny drops.
“Fortunately at least it’s beginning to happen,” he concludes. “Ï’m beginning to understand what it is to be alive, which is a joy.”

192,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/fitness/in-a-24-7-food-culture-periodic-fasting-gains-followers/,"NEW YORK: On low-carb diets, meat and cheese are OK.
On low-fat diets, fruit and oatmeal are fine.
With the latest diet trend, no foods at all are allowed for long stretches of time.
A diet that forbids eating for hours on end might seem doomed in a culture where food is constantly available, but apps and Facebook groups are popping up for people practicing “intermittent fasting.”
Bri Wyatt, a 32-year-old Tennessee resident, tried it this summer.
“At first I was like, there’s no way,” she said.
But after reading more about it, she thought it might not be that hard. She started by skipping breakfast and night-time snacks, and later moved on to a 60-day challenge of fasting every other day.
Melissa Breaux Bankston, a Crossfit instructor in New Orleans, Louisiana, also tried intermittent fasting as a way to curb her snacking. “I wanted to limit the amount of time that I was eating,” she said.

Studies on the potential health benefits of intermittent fasting are still limited, including for its effectiveness with weight loss. But heading into the new year, you may be wondering whether it could help you get in better shape.
WHEN, NOT WHAT
Like other diets, intermittent fasting helps you lose weight by setting boundaries around food. But instead of limiting what you eat, it restricts when you eat.
“It’s really another way of fooling your body into eating less calories,” said Krista Varady, who studies intermittent fasting at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Proponents say intermittent fasting helps with weight loss in other ways. For instance, they say it forces your body to start burning its own fat for fuel after depleting the energy it normally gets from food. But any effects would depend on the specific approach you take, and Varady said there isn’t strong evidence yet that intermittent fasting has any unique effects compared with other diets.
Regardless, people should consult their doctor before trying it. It’s not advised for children, people on certain medications and people with a history of eating disorders.
FASTING MENU
One of the more popular approaches to intermittent fasting is to limit eating to an 8-hour window and to fast during the day’s other 16 hours. This is called time-restricted feeding and isn’t as difficult as some other approaches, since the fasting period can include the time you’re asleep.
Many people tailor the eating window to be shorter or longer. Some eat just one meal a day, while others fast entire days a couple times a week. On fasting days, people may allow themselves around 600 calories if needed. But Dr. Jason Fung, who has written books on intermittent fasting, says skipping food altogether might actually be easier, since eating small amounts could stimulate appetite.
Whatever the method, people aren’t supposed to gorge when they stop fasting. Fung says it’s a myth that fasting leaves you famished.
Sumaya Kazi, who posts about her intermittent fasting online and offers coaching services on the diet, says it seems more difficult than it is partly because overeating has become the norm. “Intermittent fasting is more of a mental challenge than a physical challenge,” she says.
But people react differently to diets, and fasting may be a lot harder for some than for others, says Dr. Fatima Stanford, a Harvard Medical School obesity specialist.
“There’s no one size fits all,” she said.
FASTING ON TRIAL
Obesity experts have become interested in intermittent fasting, but studies on the diet are still emerging. For now, limited research suggests it may not be any better for weight loss than conventional calorie-cutting over the long term.
“Unfortunately, intermittent fasting gets a little hyped,” said Courtney Peterson, who studies the diet at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
Still, some fasting approaches may be more effective than others. And Peterson notes the difficulty of designing studies that definitively capture a diet’s effects. That’s in part because so many other variables could be at play.
For instance, researchers are looking at whether any benefits of intermittent fasting might be tied to when the eating period falls and fluctuations in how well our bodies process food throughout the day.
Some health experts say intermittent fasting might be too difficult for many people. They point to a study of 100 people where those placed in the alternate-day fasting group lost around the same amount of weight as those on conventional calorie-restriction diets over time. But the fasting group had a dropout rate of 38%, compared with 29% for the conventional diet group.
But intermittent fasting may be easier than other diets for people who already skip meals when they’re too busy, said Varady of the University of Illinois at Chicago.
To make weight loss stick, she said people should pick diets that resemble how they already eat.
“Different diets do work for different people,” she said.

193,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/china-has-pain-pill-addicts-too-but-no-ones-counting-them/,"SHANGHAI: Wu Yi was supposed to die. At age 26, his cancer was spreading.
His doctor gave him five years to live and a prescription for OxyContin.
Six years later, he was still alive. And still taking OxyContin. Wu said his doctor told him that OxyContin is not addictive, but when Wu tried to stop, he couldn’t.
“This drug is addictive,” Wu said. “One hundred percent addictive.”
A thousand miles (1,600 km) away, in the ancient trading city of Xi’an, Yin Hao shoved eight pills of Tylox, a combination painkiller that contains the opioid oxycodone, in his mouth. Yin had started taking Tylox after getting injured in a fight six years earlier.
“Do you know how f—— much I don’t want to take drugs?” he said. “My mouth says don’t take it, but my body is more honest and figures out a way to get it.”
Both Wu and Yin fell into opioid abuse the same way many Americans did, through a doctor’s prescription. But officially, in China, they don’t exist.
Addicts like Wu and Yin struggle in the shadows of a system that offers few treatment options and fails to count them in official statistics on drug abuse, the Associated Press found, making it difficult to assess abuse risks as China’s consumption of opioid painkillers rises. In a society where shame about drug addiction is strong, many believe that strict controls on painkiller use will protect China from a US-style addiction outbreak.
______
EDITOR’S NOTE: The Associated Press, supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, is investigating the global spread of opioids and its consequences.
______
As the backlash against opioid painkillers drove down US consumption, pharmaceutical companies began chasing profits in places like China, Australia and Europe using the same controversial sales tactics they did in North America. In 2017, more than half the doses of five major opioid painkillers went to countries other than the US and Canada, the first time that has happened since at least 2000, data from the International Narcotics Control Board shows.
Chinese officials have blamed out-of-control demand and poor oversight for the US opioid epidemic, discounting the role of Chinese supply. Meanwhile, painkiller addicts in China remain largely invisible and, despite strict regulations, can turn to online black markets for opioids and other prescription drugs. The AP found previously unreported trafficking of OxyContin and Tylox on e-commerce and social media platforms run by China’s largest technology companies.
Only 11,132 cases of medical drug abuse were reported in China in 2016, according to the most recent publicly available national drug abuse surveillance report. But reporting is voluntary and drawn from a small sample of institutions including law enforcement agencies, drug rehabilitation centers and some hospitals.
The China Food and Drug Administration said in the 2016 report that it was trying to do better but for the time being “the nature of medical drug abuse in the population cannot be confirmed.”
Hao Wei, president of the Chinese Association of Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment, said he believes abuse of prescription opioids is limited in China, but added that official data largely overlooks prescription drug abuse.
“What is recorded is the tip of the iceberg,” he said.
China’s National Medical Products Administration and the National Narcotics Control Commission did not respond to requests for comment.
A VISIT FROM THE GOD OF DEATH
Wu was diagnosed with lymphoma in October 2013.
Cancer transformed Wu from a baby-faced boy to a sallow wraith immobilised on a gurney. Doctors cut chemotherapy short after he developed an infection, he said, and his existence narrowed to a single, searing reality: Pain.
For six months, Wu lay in bed. Strange bulges, filled with pink fluid, appeared on his legs. It felt like his bones were swelling until they were ready to burst.
“At that time, I wanted to commit suicide because it was too painful,” he said. “But I wasn’t able to, because my leg joints and shoulder joints didn’t work.”
Wu said a doctor at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou gave him his first prescription for OxyContin in 2014, telling him he could take as much as he wanted.
As a late-stage cancer patient, Wu was exactly the kind of person OxyContin was meant to help. And the pills brought him relief. But even as the US death toll from opioid overdoses approached 400,000, no one in China warned Wu about addiction risks, he said, not his doctor or the nurses or the drug company sales representative who visited him at his bedside.
The sales rep told AP she worked for Mundipharma, a Chinese company that is owned by the Sackler family, which also owns Purdue Pharma, the American company whose sales of OxyContin allegedly helped drive the US opioid crisis. She told AP she has left Mundipharma but confirmed she used to visit some patients in the hospital. She refused to discuss further details. Three other former Mundipharma employees also told AP they regularly visited patients in the hospital, sometimes disguising themselves as doctors.
A doctor from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center told AP that sales reps are not allowed to visit patients. He said he warns patients about OxyContin’s abuse risks but acknowledged not all doctors do. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk with foreign media.
In a statement to AP, Mundipharma denied that sales staff visit patients and said it has checks and balances in place to “ensure strict compliance with medical protocols, laws and regulations.”
Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center did not respond to requests for comment.
THE PICKAXE
Yin Hao, who also goes by Yin Qiang, struggled to remember life before pain pills. He thought back to when was 21 years old, strong and wiry, working at a nightclub. He had knock-off Burberry sheets, a mortgage in his name, and a girl he planned to marry.
Then one night in 2013, he and his friends got into a fight with some older, richer guys, and someone drove a pickaxe into his waist.
The hospital sent him home with four boxes of Tylox, a combination of acetaminophen and oxycodone, the active ingredient in OxyContin. Tylox is manufactured by SpecGx, a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt, which has faced lawsuits in the US accusing it of helping stoke the opioid abuse crisis.
Mallickrodt has denied the allegations.
Yin said his doctor didn’t tell him the medicine could be addictive. Within six months, he was taking 30 pills a day.
Yin needed more and more pills to function. He opened dozens of accounts with online pharmacies to buy Tylox. Many didn’t require a prescription. Once he wrote a three-character Chinese profanity on a piece of paper and uploaded a photo of that instead of a prescription. The pills came anyway, he said. He figured pharmacies wanted the sale almost as much as he wanted the drugs. His excessive consumption didn’t trigger any alarms.
Yin lost 60 pounds. He wondered if his kidneys would fail and was convinced Tylox had changed the color of his eyes. “My nerves are a mess, my bones are misplaced and I have become lazy, irritable, extreme,” he said. “Experts say that if you take this medicine because of pain, it’s not addictive. This is rubbish.”
JUST CHEW IT
In early 2016, a doctor told Wu the cancer had come back. He signed an organ donation form, and posted it on social media with a message: “Although I don’t know when the journey of life will end, when that moment comes, I will leave behind a bunch of flowers, roses that blossom from my body.”
The proximity of death clarified Wu’s ambition. He had dropped out of school at fifteen and hustled to start a catering business, which collapsed when he got sick.
Now, Wu dreamed of leaving his parents’ home in Yangjiang, a coastal city in southern Guangdong province, and moving to Shenzhen, China’s dazzling southern boom town, to make music.
“If people don’t let me make music, I will die with everlasting regret, he said.”
Wu taught himself composition and piano from videos posted onliantipsychoticne at Bilibili, a video-sharing platform.
By 2018, Wu’s cancer was in remission and he could walk with a crutch. The pain was under control, but he kept taking OxyContin. “Once you take that drug, I’ve said it, it’s just like going home,” he said. “There’s a sense of belonging and safety.”
But the longer Wu took the pills, the less effective they were, he said. Wu started taking OxyContin with a half bottle of strong Chinese liquor, which he had delivered secretly to his house.
He also noticed the package insert for OxyContin says not to chew it, which releases the active ingredient, oxycodone, all at once rather than over time. Chewing the pills made them hit with more intensity. “As long as you try chewing it once, there’s no way for you not to chew it the next time,” he said.
MORE TERRIBLE THAN GHOSTS
Yin had vowed dozens of times to quit Tylox. He tried ice baths, saunas, and Russian vodka. He took a fistful of an antipsychotic that made him feel like his heart had stopped. He went to hypnosis and consulted cheap doctors online.
Yin said he’d gone to hospitals for help, but doctors around Panjin, the town in northeastern China where he lived with his grandparents, didn’t seem to know what withdrawal was. Some told him to go to a psychiatric hospital; others prescribed more Tylox, he said.
He moved to South Korea for a fresh start, but said he got deported after fighting with a policeman.
Once he rented a hotel room in the northeastern city of Dalian, shackled his leg to the radiator and threw the key out the window, he said. He binged on horror movies and cigarettes to distract himself and spent a few sweaty, aching hours alone, writhing in a bed that felt like it was made of fire. Then he broke the lock on his shackles, ran to a pharmacy and bought more Tylox.
On March 6, Yin woke up at 6 a.m. determined to go cold turkey. It hurt to chew. He soaked biscuits in water and gummed them; a little while later, they were diarrhea.
“If I fail and go back to taking the medicine, I will fall apart,” he said on his sixth day of sobriety.
Yin said he hoped his story would be a warning to others. If he could make a single vulnerable person understand the consequences of taking this drug, it would be one thing in his life he didn’t regret.
“I used to be afraid of ghosts, but now I think this is more terrible than ghosts,” he said.
BLACK MARKETS
Wu’s family had poured out all their meager fortune to pay his medical bills. He said health insurance had covered roughly 30 to 60 percent of the cost, depending on where he got treatment. To pay the rest, the family sold their house in August 2014. His parents, who planted orange trees before he got sick, picked up short-term jobs, like cleaning restaurants.
As 2018 rolled into 2019, Wu was still spending 1,500 yuan ($215) a month on OxyContin. His parents told him he was poisoning himself and started locking up his pills.
In April, he again swore to his family he would stop. Instead, he secretly spent his last 2,000 yuan on OxyContin.
When he went to the hospital to pick up his pills, he signed consent form that instructed him not to give the medicine to anyone else, but did not warn about the risk addiction or abuse, a copy of the signed form shows.
Wu trolled internet forums for cheaper, second-hand OxyContin. He joined an online community of opioid dealers and abusers, and grieving family members eager to get rid of left-over pain medicine.
Wu left his contact information in a thread about OxyContin on Tianya, an internet forum. He said someone offered him OxyContin left over after a family member died, but he decided to stay focused on surviving on four pills a day, down from six.
In the US, online sales fueled the spread of opioid abuse. Major tech platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, have struggled to purge themselves of illicit listings.
China has some of the strictest regulation of opioids in the world, which many believe will prevent a US style addiction outbreak. But AP found illicit trafficking of opioids on the open internet in China as well.
In a brief survey, AP identified thirteen active vendors selling OxyContin and Tylox on Tencent’s popular WeChat and QQ platforms, Alibaba’s second-hand marketplace Xianyu, Baidu’s Tieba forum, as well as Sina Corp.’s Weibo microblogging site and Zhuan Zhuan, another second-hand marketplace. Vendors often used one platform to find customers and another to execute sales. In addition, Tianya had dozens of posts from people selling or seeking OxyContin over the past few years.
The AP did not make any purchases and could not confirm the authenticity of the pills.
“Mundipharma China has no knowledge of the diversion of its products on ecommerce and social media platforms,” the company said in a statement to AP.
Mallinckrodt’s specialty generics subsidiary SpecGx sells its pain pills to a Chinese importer. In a statement, the company said it “has no manufacturing, distribution, sales force or in-country presence in China.”
Alibaba’s Xianyu, known as Idle Fish in English, said it removed listings that violated marketplace policies after AP pointed out illicit opioid sales. The company said it prohibits “illegal behavior by third-party sellers on the platform.” Sina Corp., which runs Weibo, said that after finding violations, it ran a campaign in March to clean-up illicit content about medicines and medical equipment. Xianyu, Tencent, Baidu and Sina Corp. all said they actively monitor their platforms and encourage users to proactively report illicit activity.
Tianya and 58.com, which runs Zhuan Zhuan, didn’t respond to requests for comment.
IT’S GOOD I DIDN’T DIE
On April 28, Wu ran out of money and stopped taking OxyContin. The fact that he was alive the year after he was supposed to be dead gave him hope. “I’m still young,” Wu said. “I have a lot of things to do.”
Four days later, he told a doctor at Yangchun People’s Hospital he couldn’t stop taking OxyContin and hadn’t slept in days. He left with a prescription for benzodiazepine sleeping pills and a warning not to take more than three at a time. He took 15.
The next day, he went back for more, but the doctor didn’t want to give him more than day’s supply. Wu lay on the hospital floor and refused to budge.
“I am suffering so much,” he called out. “Why do you treat me like this?’”
Wu said he managed to get more sleeping pills that week by visiting different doctors. He’d take 20 or more at a time. The pills stunned him, he said, but didn’t put him to sleep. At night, he’d just fall down, unconscious.
“It’s good I didn’t die,” he said.
Doctors at Yangchun People’s Hospital eventually cut him off and told him to go to a mental hospital, he said.
Yangchun People’s Hospital did not respond to requests for comment.
On May 29, Wu got his brain scanned at the Yangchun Minfu Psychiatric Hospital, medical records show. Doctors there first told Wu he was suffering from schizophrenia, then changed their diagnosis to depression, he said.
Wu didn’t believe he was mentally ill. He said he told doctors he was going through opioid withdrawal. He said he was given an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic.
A man who picked up the phone at Yangchun Minfu Psychiatric Hospital said the facility has no addiction treatment program and had never dealt with prescription pill abuse. He refused to give his name and hung up the phone.
Wu’s body began to swell. Terrified his cancer was back, he checked into the oncology ward of Yangchun People’s Hospital on June 15. A blood test came back clean, he said. His cancer was still in remission.
By the end of June, the worst of the withdrawal symptoms were gone.
THE WORLD WITHOUT HIM IS AN ABYSS
Despite the officially low numbers of pill addicts, the Chinese government was concerned enough about painkiller abuse that in September it pulled combination opioid painkillers, including Tylox, from most pharmacies.
On September 18, Yin Hao posted an elegy to Tylox on WeChat. The world without Tylox, he wrote, “is an abyss.”
He said he was taking more than 100 Tylox pills a day, which added up to over 500 mg of oxycodone and 32,500 mg of acetaminophen. The US Centers for Disease Control says a dose of just 33 mg of oxycodone a day doubles the risk of overdose. Taking more than 4,000 mg of acetaminophen daily can result in severe liver damage and death.
Before the new regulations took effect, it was easy to get Tylox from pharmacies in certain cities and online without a prescription. Earlier this year, AP identified five pharmacies selling Tylox without a prescription. In addition, three of six online pharmacies that said they had Tylox in stock sold it without a prescription, AP found.
A month after the new rules took effect, Yin had just two pills left. He thought about committing a crime or using harder drugs so the police would force him into a mandatory detox center.
By November Yin’s pill box was full again. He claimed he was able to buy Tylox illegally from some online pharmacies. He said he lied to doctors at hospitals to get more pills, though not everyone fell for it.
Yin said he got Tylox sales agents to sell him bulk pills directly and bribed a courier not to examine his packages. He declined to share their names with AP, and it was impossible to verify his claim.
Sometimes Yin worried police were following him. He didn’t want to go to prison, he said. He wanted to go to rehab.
If he could unspool his life and wind it up again, Yin said the second time round he would take pain instead of Tylox.
WU’S DREAM
At 9:40 a.m. on September 23, Wu took a bus to Shenzhen and found a cheap third-floor room for rent.
“My dream is making music,” Wu said in an interview earlier this month. “But in the two months since I came to Shenzhen, I have found the reality and dream are pretty different. Reality is crueler.”
Wu’s face and hands seemed too big for his narrow hips. He was trying to get his body in better shape to prepare for hip replacement surgery, which he hopes to have next year. He flashed a smile and said he’d earn enough from singing to pay for the operation, but so far he’s barely making rent.
Around 1 a.m. early one Friday, Wu strapped a bottle of water onto the wheeled cart he uses to haul his amplifier around, grabbed his crutch and thumped down the stairs. He yanked his gear into the dark December chill and headed over to a strip of restaurants to see if he could sell any songs.
At 1:15 a.m. it started to rain. Bad luck. There was hardly anyone around. A friendly restaurant manager let him sit under a bright blue awning until the rain stopped.
Wu picked up his crutch and hauled his amplifier down a block and up a block and down a block again, peering into each small restaurant for stragglers who might pay him 30 yuan ($4) to sing.
At 2:45 a.m., people at a table laden with empty beers took Wu’s menu of songs, mostly Cantonese hits from the Eighties and Nineties, and after long deliberation, picked one. Wu sat in the cold near a hunk of glistening meat on display and waited for the people at the table to go to the bathroom and buy more cigarettes.
Finally, Wu began to sing, a song called, “My Good Brothers.”
“Thank you,” he said when he was done.
No one clapped.

194,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/chinese-court-sentences-gene-editing-scientist-to-three-years-in-prison/,"
BEIJING: A Chinese court sentenced the scientist who created the world’s first “gene-edited” babies to three years in prison on Monday, according to the official Xinhua news agency, on charges of illegally practicing medicine.
He Jiankui, then an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, said in November 2018 that he had used gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to change the genes of twin girls to protect them from getting infected with the AIDS virus in the future.

The backlash in China and globally about the ethics of his research and work was fast and widespread.
He and his collaborators forged ethical review materials and recruited men with AIDS who were part of a couple to carry out the gene-editing. His experiments ultimately resulted in two women giving birth to three gene-edited babies, according to Xinhua.
The court also handed lesser sentences to Zhang Renli and Qin Jinzhou, who worked at two unnamed medical institutions, for having conspired with He in his work.
“The three accused did not have the proper certification to practice medicine, and in seeking fame and wealth, deliberately violated national regulations in scientific research and medical treatment,” the court said, according to Xinhua.
“They’ve crossed the bottom line of ethics in scientific research and medical ethics.”

195,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/samoa-ends-measles-state-of-emergency-as-infection-rate-slows/,"
MELBOURNE: The South Pacific island nation of Samoa has lifted a six week-state of emergency after the infection rate from a measles outbreak that has swept the country started to come under control.
Samoa’s island population of just 200,000 has been gripped by the highly infectious disease that has killed 81 people, most of them babies and young children, and infected more than 5,600 people.
The government said in a statement late on Saturday that the emergency orders, which included aggressive measures to contain the virus such as closing schools and restricting travel, put in place last month had ended.

Measles cases are on the rise globally, including in wealthy nations such as the United States and Germany, where some parents shun life-saving vaccines due to false theories suggesting links between childhood immunizations and autism.
Death and infection rates in Samoa started to slow in mid-December after a vaccine drive pushed immunisation rates towards 95%, the level aid agencies say is effective in creating “herd immunity” that can contain the disease.
Earlier in the year, an outbreak of measles hit the New Zealand city of Auckland, a hub for travel to and from small Pacific islands.

Comic has gone viral, translated into 10 languages
Artist says the issue needs to be better known
China says no mistreatment of Uighurs

TOKYO: A Japanese artist whose manga comics about a Uighur woman went viral wants to use the simple power of her work to raise awareness of the “daily suffering” endured by the Chinese mostly Muslim minority, she told Reuters.
With “What Has Happened to Me”, a manga comic that has been translated into 10 languages – including Mandarin, Uighur and English – and viewed more than 330,000 times online, artist Tomomi Shimizu has seized on an issue that many Western countries see as evidence of Beijing’s abuse of human rights.

In panels of spare, black-and-white drawings, Shimizu tells the story of Mihrigul Tursun, a real Uighur woman who now lives in the United States and says she was beaten and detained in China for being a Uighur.
“The Uighur issue has been well known among people who are into politics. But little is known among the general public. The gap is staggering,” Shimizu, 50, told Reuters in an interview.
“I decided to use manga for this purpose because I believe manga has power to convey things to people in an easy-to-understand way.”
Shimizu, who has penned another comic about Uighurs, appears to be no stranger to politics, having voiced support on her Twitter account for issues generally backed by Japan’s right wing.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, most of them ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions in the Xinjiang region of northwest China, as part of what Beijing calls an antiterrorism campaign.
China has said Xinjiang faces a threat from Islamist militants and separatists.
Beijing rejects accusations of mistreatment and denies mass internment, saying it is simply seeking to end extremism and violence in Xinjiang through education, and that it is offering Uighurs better employment prospects with vocational training.
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Chinese government has accused Tursun of spreading lies about her time in Xinjiang and strongly denied her accusations of mistreatment.
COMFORT WOMEN, ‘HARDSHIP’
Shimizu has at times voiced opposition to China but says she is not trying to use the Uighur issue to smear China.
She has tweeted that China wants to see Japan’s southern island of Okinawa become independent.
In 2015, she raised doubts about the grounds for criticism that China and South Korea level at Japan, describing former “comfort women” – a Japanese euphemism for the women, many of them Korean, who were forced to work in Japan’s wartime military brothels – as “lying”.
Shimizu told Reuters that while she felt truly sorry for those women who had been taken against their will, she found dubious some of the accounts told by former comfort women.
Shimizu based her manga story on what she learned from watching video-recorded testimony from Tursun.
In the comic, Tursun is detained by Chinese authorities despite having committed no crime. She is separated from her 45-day-old triplets and is tortured with electric rods.
She is paroled only to find out that one of her triplets died in government custody. Later, she is incarcerated again, in a room so crowded that detainees have to take turns to lie down.
After a third detention, she asks why she has to face so much hardship. An official says: “It is because you are Uighur”.
“There are people who need help now, people who are going through hardship every day,” Shimizu said.
She uploaded “What Has Happened to Me” on her Twitter account on Aug 31. Soon, messages started pouring in “like a waterfall”, and it was retweeted 8,000 times in a few hours.
“It is without doubt that Ms Shimizu’s manga has played an invaluable role in letting the world know the Uighur issue,” Japan Uyghur Association Chairman Ilham Mahmut said.
Lee Da-Ren, a Taiwanese living in Japan, volunteered to translate Shimizu’s work into Mandarin.
“By taking the form of manga, the story is so easy to read, and yet so penetrating,” Lee said.

Warragamba Dam services 80% of Sydney‘s 5 million residents
Temperatures in NSW set to spike next week
Govt minister says looking into support for volunteers
Fires travel immense distances in Australia

SYDNEY: Australian authorities said on Friday they are focused on protecting water plants, pumping stations, pipes and other infrastructure from intense bushfires surrounding Sydney, the country’s largest city.
Firefighters battling the blazes for weeks received a reprieve of slightly cooler, damper conditions over Christmas, but the respite is not expected to last long.
Temperatures in New South Wales (NSW) state are forecast to head back towards 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) early next week, fuelling fires near Warragamba Dam, which provides water to about 80% of Sydney‘s 5 million residents.
“In recent days up to the cool change, the fires had been a potential threat to supply and assets, particularly in Warragamba and in the Blue Mountains,” a spokesman for the state’s water authority, WaterNSW, told Reuters.
“With the coming very hot conditions the fire situation may escalate in both those fronts and possibly elsewhere.”
Warragamba Dam is located 65km (40 miles) west of Sydney, catching water flowing from the mountains.
It is at 44.8% capacity, down from almost being full less than three years ago, as a prolonged drought ravages the continent’s east.
Despite the widespread destruction, the state’s water infrastructure network has not been damaged, the spokesman said.
There have been eight deaths, including two volunteer firefighters, linked to the blazes since they flared in spring.
With more than 40 dams across the state, WaterNSW supplies two-thirds of untreated water to the state’s water utilities, which then treat and clean the resource to provide drinking water to cities and regional towns.
Large quantities of ash and burnt material could pose a threat to the quality of water in the dams if the fires are followed by heavy rain.
However, there is no significant rain forecast for NSW in the short-term and WaterNSW has put containment barriers to catch potential debris run-off, the water authority said.
VOLUNTEER FORCE
Australia’s reliance on a large volunteer firefighting force has been tested during this fire season that still potentially has months to run through the southern hemisphere summer.
While conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison previously said compensation for volunteers was not a priority, he said on Tuesday that government workers could receive additional paid leave for volunteering.
A senior government minister said on Friday the government was now looking into providing wider relief.
“The prime minister is looking at this issue further on how we can provide targeted support in these extreme circumstances so that our volunteers get the support they need to keep volunteering,” Defence Minister Linda Reynolds told media in Perth.
While there are different rules across Australia’s states, volunteers tend to negotiate time off directly with their employer.
Morrison has been under intense political pressure after it was revealed he was holidaying in Hawaii shortly before Christmas while the country grappled with an emergency and two volunteers near the fire frontlines had been killed.
Fires are travelling immense distances through bushland before hitting towns and containment lines where volunteer firefighters concentrate their resources.
The bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares (9.9 million acres) across the country, dwarfing the terrain burnt by fierce fires in California during 2019.

198,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/california-jails-use-kinder-approach-to-solitary-confinement/,"SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA: An inmate in solitary confinement at a California jail was refusing to leave his cell. The jailers’ usual response: Send an “extraction team” of corrections officers to burst into the cell and drag him out.
But not in Contra Costa County, one of three in the state using a kinder, gentler approach in response to inmate lawsuits, a policy change that experts say could be a national model for reducing the use of isolation cells.
So the inmate was asked: “What if we gave you a couple extra cookies and another sandwich? Would you move?” recalled Don Specter, the nonprofit Prison Law Office director who negotiated the new policies. “He said yes. … They were like, ‘Wow.'”
More than a quarter of US states and numerous smaller jurisdictions are looking for ways to reduce the use of solitary confinement, according to the Vera Institute of Justice, which encourages alternatives to a practice behavioral experts say is dehumanizing and can worsen mental illness.
The new policies in California came after Specter’s firm sued seven of California’s 58 counties, alleging that conditions had grown inhumane as jails absorbed inmates who previously would have served their sentences in state prisons. The state in 2011 began sending less serious offenders to local jails for years at a time to ease crowding in state penitentiaries.
Some jurisdictions nationwide are banning isolation for young offenders, pregnant women or those with mental health diagnoses. The California counties’ approach of generally limiting it to those who engage in continued violent behavior has dramatically reduced the number of inmates in isolation and the length of time they stay there.
Contra Costa started 2019 with about 100 people in solitary, most for more than a year. It had just three in isolation cells by December, after officials began using the new approach.
Sacramento County also is following the policy pioneered by Santa Clara County, while Fresno County is considering it. Among other things, it encourages the use of low-cost incentives to reward good behavior, like the opportunity to listen to the radio, watch a movie or get an extra snack.
Sacramento County has cut its isolated population roughly in half, to about 60 inmates, said Lt Alex McCamy: “It’s a limited time frame and a limited group, but the initial impression is positive.”
Rick Raemisch, who restricted the use of solitary confinement when he headed Colorado’s prison system, said the violent, tense, dirty conditions in Santa Clara County’s jail improved markedly with the new policy.
“Think of yourself being in a cell the size of a parking space for 23 hours a day,” said Raemisch, who consulted with county officials. “At a minimum you’re going to get angry, and when you get angry you’re going to fight back.”
Inmates nationwide are most often segregated for nonviolent “nuisance infractions” like smoking, cursing, disobeying orders or having unauthorized items from the commissary, said the Vera Institute’s Sara Sullivan.
Santa Clara County once locked a woman in solitary confinement for 2 1/2 years for talking back to correctional officers or yelling and banging on her cell door with other detainees, according to Specter’s lawsuit.
The California counties’ new policy of restricting its use to continued violent behavior could be seen as a national pilot program, Sullivan said.
New Jersey’s Middlesex County Adult Correction Center has lowered the number of isolated inmates and the time they spend there, she said, but with a different approach that lets inmates out of their cells more frequently.
The Hampden County Correctional Center in Massachusetts increased its use of alternative sanctions and positive reinforcement. And Cook County, Illinois, no longer keeps troublesome inmates in isolation, allowing them to regularly spend time with about a half-dozen other inmates.
“There’s been a decades-long effort to reform solitary, especially in prisons. But what we haven’t seen is a paired reform effort for jails,” said Amy Fettig, director of the American Civil Liberty Union’s Stop Solitary campaign. “In Santa Clara what we’re seeing is an attempt to reform the whole process.”
Long-term isolation can be so debilitating, Fettig said, that she’s had clients cut themselves “just to feel something because they’ve become numb.”
Santa Clara County, home to San Jose and Silicon Valley, once had 400 inmates in solitary confinement. Specter’s client in Santa Clara County had been in solitary confinement for nearly five years.
By last fall there were about 40 inmates confined to isolation cells for an average of about two months, and just 26 by December.
Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said she and many deputies were initially skeptical.
“It has surprised me, and I think it’s very, very good for our inmates,” she said. “I think what we’re doing is correct, and I think it’s working.”
Smith said she remains concerned that assaults on staff are up. She said the increase is logical, however, since inmates locked in their cells virtually around the clock have little opportunity to assault anyone.
Sgt. Todd Kendrick, president of the county’s correctional officers association, attributed the increase to other less restrictive jail policies as well as the easing of solitary confinement. He and Smith both called for increased staffing.
Smith said the county fell into a pattern of protectively isolating inmates to separate purported gang members and those charged with murder and to safeguard jailhouse informants or sex offenders for fear they would be harmed. Officials sought to improve after several major incidents, including deaths in custody.
Like most jails, three-quarters or more of inmates had not been convicted of a crime and yet spent months and sometimes years awaiting trial in isolation. Under the new policy, “it’s really our philosophy to use that when it’s absolutely necessary, when there’s extraordinary risk,” Smith said.
Jail employees work to get inmates out of segregation as quickly as possible, often using a system in which inmates agree, in writing, not to assault each other.
One inmate refused for 1½ years to leave solitary because he had testified against other gang members, recalled Capt. Thomas Duran, who coordinates the program.
But he saw other longtime inmates leaving segregation and eventually agreed to try it. Rather than put him immediately in with other inmates, deputies paired him with a single inmate — then two other inmates, then four and so on.
He spent more and more time out of his solitary cell until he was fully back into the general jail population.
“We’re trying to set the inmates up not to fail,” Duran said.

199,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/rhino-poaching-at-record-levels-in-botswana/,"GABORONE: Rhino poaching in Botswana’s Okavango Delta has risen at an unprecedented rate with 23 white rhinoceros and eight black rhinoceros killed since October 2018, the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism said.
“Between April and October 2019, nine rhinos were killed. The unfortunate incidents have increased with 13 more rhinos having been poached from October to date,” the ministry said in a statement seen by Reuters late on Monday.
Despite heavy rhino poaching in neighbouring South Africa, which has one of the world’s largest rhino populations, only six rhinos were killed for their horns in Botswana between 2007 and 2017 conversation organisation Save the Rhino said on its website.
The actual size of the Botswana rhino population is kept a secret by government officials but the Department of Wildlife and National Parks Rhino Coordinator, Dr Mmadi Reuben said in October that if the poaching ‘continued at this rate there will be no rhinos in Botswana in a year or two, especially the black rhino, a critically endangered species’.
Botswana is believed to have benefited in 2015 when South Africa moved around 100 rhinos to neighbouring countries as part of efforts to stem the illicit slaughter of the animals for their horns.
Widely regarded as a safe haven for wildlife, Botswana has a strict anti-poaching policy and says it has committed immense resources to combat poaching but poachers have taken advantage of the large size of the Okavango Delta and its difficult wetland terrain.
Botswana said it has stepped up efforts to address poaching with interventions leading to the recovery of some horns and hunting weapons.
A rhino horn is estimated by conservationists to be worth more than $65,000 a kg with demand rising, particularly in Asia, where a newly affluent class regards it as a status symbol and is used as medicine.

Merck & Co said on Friday it expects to make licensed doses of its recently approved Ebola vaccine available in the third quarter of 2020 and price the single-dose injection at the lowest possible access price for poor and middle-income countries.
The vaccine, Ervebo, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, a month after Europe gave its nod to the vaccine, a move that has been hailed by the World Health Organization.

“We have made a commitment to making the vaccine available to GAVI-eligible countries at the lowest possible access price,” Merck spokesman Skip Irvine said. “We have made that commitment but we have not yet established the price for the vaccine.”
Stockpile of 500,00 doses of Ebola vaccine is being established for emergency use in outbreaks of the deadly fever by the GAVI global vaccine alliance, Reuters reported earlier this month. The stockpiling will start with Merck’s Ervebo vaccine.
GAVI, a public-private partnership backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the WHO, the World Bank and UNICEF, arranges bulk buys to reduce vaccine costs for poor countries.
“We are partnering with both GAVI and WHO to put that stockpile in place as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement, adding that the stockpile of vaccines will be governed and executed by the owner of the stockpile and not by Merck.
The Ebola virus causes haemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids. It kills around half of those it infects.
There have been more than 3,000 cases of Ebola, including 2,199 deaths, in the outbreak that was declared in August 2018. The WHO declared it an international emergency in July 2019.
The company said it was working closely with the U.S. government, WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI to prepare against the disease.
Johnson and Johnson’s two-dose vaccine is currently being reviewed by the European regulator. The company is in discussion with the FDA for US approval.
Merck shares rose as much as up 2.8% to record high of $92.55 on Friday.

Six people have now died in bushfires which have destroyed more than 3.7 million hectares (9.1 million acres) across five states.
Potter Steve Harrison, 67, only survived a major blaze southwest of Sydney by crawling beneath a makeshift kiln as the flames passed over.
Harrison stayed to defend his property in the town of Balmoral on Sunday but by the time he changed his mind it was too late to leave.
“I ran to my ute (truck) but my garden was already on fire, the driveway was on fire, the road was on fire so I couldn’t evacuate,” Harrison told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
“The day before I had actually built myself a small kiln down the back — a coffin-sized kiln — just big enough for me to crawl inside,” he said.
“I could have (died) if I hadn’t thought about plan B. In that little kiln enclosure I made, I had a fire extinguisher, a bucket of water, a drinking water bottle and a fire blanket.”
The town of Balmoral, population 400 and 150 houses, was virtually destroyed, the New South Wales (NSW) State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
Australia has been fighting wildfires for months as hot, dry conditions brought about an early start to the fire season.
Australia posted record temperatures over 41 degrees Celsius (105 Celsius) last week as an extreme heatwave swept across the country and a long-running drought in the country’s east has created tinder-dry conditions.
Nearly 100 fires are burning across New South Wales state.
“Conditions have begun to ease,” the New South Wales (state) Rural Fire Service said on Monday.
“Crews will continue their work today to identify and strengthen (fire) containment lines, with favourable conditions over coming days.”
Temperatures are forecast to spike again in many states by the weekend, with the South Australian capital city of Adelaide forecast to reach 39 Celsius (102.2 Fahrenheit), according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Similar temperatures are expected in the Victorian city of Melbourne.
In South Australia one person was confirmed dead in weekend fires and fire fighters were facing another tough day on Monday.
In the Adelaide Hills, a wine growing region where state authorities said 86 homes were destroyed, up to one third of the region’s vineyards were in the “burnout zone,” equivalent to 1,100 hectares of vines, said Jared Stringer, vice president of Adelaide Hills wine region.

Greater Sydney and two other areas rated “catastrophic”
Six fires in NSW burning at emergency level
Person dies in SA fires, 23 firefighters injured
Late wind change expected to lower temperatures this evening

SYDNEY: Catastrophic conditions fueled massive bushfires across Australia’s New South Wales state on Saturday, with two blazes around Sydney burning at emergency level, while in South Australia one person was found dead in a fire zone.
Some major roads heading to the south and west from Sydney were closed for part of the day and authorities asked people to delay travel at the start of the Christmas holiday period, warning of the unpredictability of the fires due to high winds and temperatures above 40C (104F).
A cooling but powerful wind with gusts of up to 90 kmh (56 mph) from the south swept through the state late on Saturday, lowering temperatures significantly but also creating risks that the winds could spread the flames and embers.
“Today has been an awful day,” NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said of the conditions which were rated “catastrophic”, the highest level of danger.
Fitzsimmons said conditions in Sydney may not have reached forecast catastrophic levels, although they did elsewhere. He said the haze from the fires that has choked the city in recent weeks might have helped cap temperatures on Saturday by acting as insulation.
By early evening, six fires in the state were rated at emergency level, including two around Sydney.
“We have seen property impacted and lost. We have 3,000 firefighters and emergency services personnel out there dealing with the fires,” Fitzsimmons told a media conference.
Media reported one person was unaccounted for near Lithgow, a town about 140 km (85 miles) west of Sydney where a number of properties were burned.
Close to 100 fires were burning across NSW, and the RFS said some fires were generating their own thunderstorms. Conditions were expected to improve in coming days, before another burst of hot weather in about a week.
“We will not get on top of these fires until we get some decent rain – we have said that for weeks and months,” Fitzsimmons said.
No significant rainfall was expected in the next couple of months, the Bureau of Meteorology said.
The Gospers Mountain mega fire has already burned almost 460,000 hectares (1.14 million acres) to the northwest of Sydney, and there was a risk it could join up with the Grose Valley fire in the Blue Mountains to the west of Sydney.
The death of the two firefighters on Thursday night, when a tree fell on their truck as they drove through a firefront, brought the death toll from the NSW wildfires to eight since early October.
Shortly after the two deaths were announced, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was rushing back from a family holiday in Hawaii, a trip that had drawn sharp criticism as the crisis deepened. He was expected to arrive later on Saturday.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA FIRES
In South Australia, authorities said one person had been found dead, another was critically injured and 15 homes had been destroyed by a fire in the Adelaide Hills, just 40 kilometres (25 miles) east of the state capital of Adelaide.
The death followed another fatality in South Australia on Friday, the result of a car crash which sparked a fire.
Authorities said fires had burnt through some 40,000 hectares in the state and 23 firefighters suffered injuries on Friday.
In Victoria, authorities said 142 fires had started in the state since Friday, with one burning at an emergency level late on Saturday afternoon.
Australia has been fighting wildfires for weeks, with blazes destroying more than 700 homes and nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland.

204,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/scientists-claim-to-find-ancient-seawall-off-israeli-coast/,"HAHOTRIM BEACH, ISRAEL: An international team of researchers says it has discovered a 7,000-year-old-seawall along Israel’s Mediterranean coast, providing evidence that coastal communities protected themselves against rising waters even in ancient times.
The scientists believe the more than 100-metre-long (110-yard-long) structure acted as a fortification against surging waters and storms. The study, published Wednesday in the Public Library of Science One journal, said the Neolithic era village, called Tel Hreiz, was abandoned and eventually swallowed by the sea.

“Here we have an example, a practical example of a process that is still going on. We can see a whole community which are now under the sea,” said Ehud Galili, lead researcher and archaeologist from Israel’s Haifa University.
The researchers believe the structure was built by villagers out of riverbed boulders found several kilometres (miles) away. The site lies just south of the northern Israeli port city of Haifa.
While seas were rising at a faster rate during the Neolithic period than they are today, the causes were much different, according to co-author Jonathan Benjamin from Flinders University in Australia.
“There’s a big difference between climate change and prehistory which was naturally occurring, and climate change now, which is due to this huge human intervention,” Benjamin said.
Still, similar to contemporary coastal communities, Benjamin said the villagers of Tel Hreiz had to make “the very human decision” to stay or go as the coastline receded.
The ancient settlement was first exposed in the mid-1960s and re-covered by thick sands. After winter storms along the coast in 2012 and 2015 moved these sediments, the structure was uncovered.
Archaeologists have also dug up pottery, animal and human remains that, based on carbon dating, are believed to be from the same settlement.
The community, Galili said, was an “early Mediterranean fishing village” which relied on farming, animal husbandry and exploitation of the land and sea. During the excavations, they also found early examples of olive oil extraction.
At first, researchers considered the possibility that the wall was built for other reasons like agriculture or protection from attackers. But Galili said that during this period, enemies would have come from land and not the sea. He also said there was no sign that the wall extended around the village to defend against land invasions. He concluded the wall “has no other function possible” except to protect against the elements.
Researchers say the seawall itself — found about 120 metres (130 yards) off the coast — is the only structure of its kind found in Israel’s coastal region, making it a “unique example” of the human response to the threat of shrinking coastlines in the Neolithic period.
Roland Gehrels, a physical geographer at Britain’s University of York who specializes in sea-level studies and was not involved in this study, called the discovery a “fascinating find.” He said, however, that the structure was more likely meant to protect against storms than gradually rising sea levels.
“I doubt that humans would have been able to notice this sea-level rise in their lifetime, but they were of course well aware of winter storms and the damage those caused,” he said.
Matteo Vacchi, an expert in coastal changes in the Mediterranean at the University of Pisa who also did not participate in the study, agreed the exact purpose of the seawall is hard to determine. “But what is interesting is that there was this kind of approach of coastal protection even in the Neolithic,” he said.

205,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/murakami-holds-rare-public-reading-to-mark-debut-anniversary/,"TOKYO: A monkey that confesses he steals women’s identity cards, causing them to temporarily forget who they are, starred Tuesday as author Haruki Murakami marked 40 years since his debut as a novelist with his first public reading in Japan in nearly a quarter-century.
Now 70 and one of the world’s most popular and acclaimed novelists, Murakami debuted with “Hear the Wind Sing” in 1979, four years after he began writing while running a jazz bar in Tokyo. His 1987 romantic novel “Norwegian Wood” was his first best-seller, establishing him as a young literary star. His latest novel, “Killing Commendatore,” hit US bookstores last year.

Media-shy Murakami’s last public readings were in Kobe and Ashiya in western Japan, where he grew up, following a deadly 1995 earthquake there. On Tuesday, he was joined by award-winning young female novelist Mieko Kawakami, a longtime Murakami fan who was in the audience at both events 24 years ago before she became a novelist.
After the two authors took turns reading passages from their works, Murakami said, “Actually, I have a brand new novel that I wrote a few weeks ago, and I haven’t even published it.” He said it is called “Confessions of a Shinagawa Monkey” and is a sequel to “A Shinagawa Monkey,” a story of a woman named Mizuki who forgets her name because a monkey had stolen it, published as part of a 2002 compilation, “Five Strange Tales from Tokyo.”
The new story takes place at a small Japanese hot spring hotel where a monkey appears as the protagonist takes a bath. The monkey, apparently speaking in Japanese, offers to wash his back, and explains he was raised by a professor and grew up listening to classical music such as Joseph Bruckner and Richard Strauss. The monkey faced discrimination in the conformist monkey community and ended up at the hot springs hotel where he is hired as a helper and given an attic to live in.
After the protagonist invites the monkey to his room for a chat over beer, the monkey says he is called Shinagawa Monkey and reveals he has a bad habit of stealing part of the names of women he falls in love with by taking their driver’s licenses and other identification cards, causing them to forget their names.
Murakami said ” Confessions of a Shinagawa Monkey” takes about 50 minutes to read, so he read a 30-minute abridged version for the event. Murakami comically acted out conversation between the monkey and the protagonist, setting off laughter from the floor. He said the story may be published in the near future.
Without any video cameras present, Murakami appeared relaxed as he and Kawakami took turns reading their works. Kawakami won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize in 2008 for “Breasts and Eggs” and has penned other award-winning novels including “Dreams of Love, etc,” “Yearning” and “Heaven.”
The two authors have published a new book, “A Horned Owl Takes Off at Dawn: A long long interview by Kawakami Mieko,” a collection of her interviews of Murakami.

206,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/new-autism-guidelines-focus-in-early-diagnosis-treatment/,"
CHICAGO: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) on Monday issued its first new autism treatment guidelines in 12 years aimed at helping doctors identify at-risk children and getting them the care they need as early as possible.
Since developmental delays are often present in very young children with autism, the report, published in the journal Pediatrics, urges doctors to check for issues during all well-baby visits and refer children for treatment at the first sign of an issue, rather than wait for a formal autism evaluation.
More than five million Americans are living with autism, a spectrum of disorders marked by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive behaviours of widely varying severity.
“The benefit of identifying children as early as possible is they can then be referred for treatment,” Dr Susan Levy, a developmental and behavioural paediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and co-author of the report, said in a phone interview.
Early treatment and particularly behavioural interventions do make a difference, Levy said.
Since 2007, when AAP published its last two guidance documents, the number of children in the United States diagnosed with autism has risen sharply. Autism now affects 1 in 59 children in the United States, up from 1 in 155 in 2007.
In that time, scientists have developed a better understanding of the potential risk factors and genes that contribute to autism, the related medical and behavioural conditions that commonly occur in children with the condition, and have detailed evidence on which interventions work best.
“This report is really focused on educating paediatricians and other healthcare providers about all the options and issues, and working to empower them since they’re in the front lines to make the early referrals,” Levy said.
The report urges doctors to steer families toward interventions backed by research and away from those with flimsy evidence. It specifically calls out many nutritional interventions that “do not have evidence to support their use.”
It also focuses on the need to screen for and treat other conditions that commonly occur in children with autism.
Some 40% of individuals with autism have intellectual disability, the report said, and about 40% to 60% of school-aged children and adults with autism have anxiety disorders. Others include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), language disorders, sleep and feeding disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms and seizures.
The report encourages doctors to share decision making with families and help them plan for when a child transitions to adolescence and adulthood.

207,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australia-firefighters-accidentally-spread-blaze-ahead-of-heatwave/,"SYDNEY: A backburning operation intended to contain a massive wildfire in eastern Australia sparked out of control, damaging buildings and cutting off major roads, authorities said, as the country heads into another heatwave that may topple temperature records.
The accident occurred about 250 km (155 miles) northwest of Sydney, where firefighters were trying to stop a blaze of some 378,000 hectares (934,000 acres) reaching communities by employing pre-emptive controlled burning.
“We saw a dramatic shift in conditions, a flare-up of fire, some extraordinary behaviour of that fire, and that fire has spread,” New South Wales state Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Monday.
Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the area, Fitzsimmons added, although he did not give an exact figure. There were no new reports of casualties on Monday.
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned nearly 3 million acres of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Bushfires are common in Australia‘s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
Spot fires that would normally be contained on their own have been fanned by wind, coming together into what authorities have called megafires to Sydney’s north, west and south, prompting evacuations and sporadically shrouding the country’s biggest city in smoke.
The Bureau of Meteorology warned of severe to extreme heatwave conditions in the inland parts of the country’s south-east, with temperatures expected to approach or exceed a national average record of 40.3 degrees Celsius (105.4 degrees Fahrenheit).
“We saw significant heat build over Western Australia over the course of last week, and that heat is now pushing east over the continent, which is going to lead to several days of exceptional heat,” bureau climatologist Blair Trewin said in a statement.
“We’re closely monitoring the development and progression of this heat but based on current forecasts we could see that record broken this week.”
The Rural Fire Service’s Fitzsimmons said the heat would exacerbate fire danger, and “despite the very best efforts of everyone, we’re not going to able to contain these fires that we’re expecting later in the week.”

208,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/samoa-extends-measles-state-of-emergency-nz-to-fund-pacific-vaccination-campaign/,"MELBOURNE: The South Pacific island nation of Samoa on Saturday extended a state of emergency due to a measles outbreak which has killed 72 people, mostly infants, as New Zealand announced NZ$1 million ($640,700) to help combat measles in the Pacific.
Samoa said a state of emergency will be extended to December 29 with 5,154 cases of measles now reported since the outbreak started in October. Samoa has a population of only 200,000.
Measles started appearing en masse earlier this year in the New Zealand city of Auckland, a hub for travel to and from small South Pacific islands.
The majority of those who have died in Samoa due to the highly infectious disease have been aged four and under. The island nation had a far lower vaccination rate than its regional neighbours.
Following a mandatory immunization campaign, the Samoan government said approximately 93% of all eligible people in Samoa have now been vaccinated against measles.
“Prevention through vaccination is the most effective way of avoiding illness and a costly health emergency,” New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in a statement announcing the funding.
Under the plan, children under five and new mothers and their families will be targeted for vaccination. The funding would be directed to the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
WHO has described the fact children die from a vaccine-preventable disease as a “collective failure” to protect the world’s most vulnerable children.
The organization said measles infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children.
The picture for 2019 is even worse, it said, with provisional data up to November showing a three-fold increase in case of numbers compared with the same period in 2018.
Measles epidemics have occurred this year in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine.

209,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/edcd-prepares-national-guidelines-for-snakebite-management/,"Kathmandu, December 11
Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under the Department of Health Services has come up with national guideline for snakebite management in Nepal.
According to EDCD an estimated 20,000 people get  bitten by snakes and 10 per cent of them succumb to snakebites, across the country, every year.
Earlier, there was a protocol on snakebite management published by Ministry of Health in 2003.

The national guideline has explained about kinds of snakes found in Nepal, clinical manifestation of common venomous snakes, diagnosis of snakebite, clinical syndrome of snakebite, first aid treatment for patient of snakebite, referral of snakebite patients to health facilities and their role for snakebite management. The guideline explains about condition of referral, management of snakebite when no anti-venom is available and prevention of snakebite.
“The guideline will provide information on venomous snakes found in Nepal and will help in diagnosis of snakebite and its management. The guideline is intended to ensure standardised, timely and effective management of snake bite in the country. This guideline, I hope will be helpful for all health practitioners, army and police personnel, who have been working in preventing and treating snakebite patients, across the country,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.
The government is committed to achieving the national target, which is aligned with World Health Organisation’s target of 50 per cent reduction in deaths and disabilities due to snakebite by 2030.
“The guideline will help health workers to ensure early intervention and efficient use of anti-venom to save lives,” added Dr Lal. The national guideline is expected to avoid misuse of anti-venom, help early recognition of clinical features of snakebite, reaction to anti-venom, and provide appropriate management including artificial ventilation for patients if required.
Snakebite is life threatening medical emergency and survival of snakebite patients depends largely on appropriate first aid measures and immediate transportation to the nearest health centre where facility to administer anti-snake venom and supportive care is available.
The division has planned to train master trainers to help prevent snakebite in all provinces across the country.
“There will be at least three master trainers in all provinces across the country within this fiscal. These trainers will train other health workers in their respected provinces to help save lives from snakebite,” said Dr Lal.

210,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/thunberg-a-bit-surprised-to-be-time-person-of-the-year/,"MADRID: Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg said she was surprised and honoured on Wednesday to be named Time’s youngest Person of the Year, while adding that others in the global movement she helped inspire deserve to share the accolade.
The 16-year-old Swede has become the face of a new generation of environmental activists, drawing large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences over the past year and a half. Some have welcomed her work, including her speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming. But others have criticized her sometimes combative tone.
“For sounding the alarm about humanity’s predatory relationship with the only home we have, for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders, for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads, Greta Thunberg is Time’s 2019 Person of the Year,” the media franchise said on its website.

As she left a UN climate conference in Madrid, Thunberg told The Associated Press that she was “a bit surprised” at the recognition.
“I could never have imagined anything like that happening,” she said in a phone interview.
“I’m of course, very grateful for that, very honoured,” Thunberg said, but added: “It should be everyone in the Fridays for Future movement because what we have done, we have done together.”
Thunberg said she hoped the message being pushed by her and other activists — that governments need to drastically increase their efforts to combat climate change — is finally getting through. The “Greta effect” has already been linked to a rise in support for environmental parties in Europe.
But she insisted that the media should also pay attention to other activists, particularly indigenous people, whom she said “are hit hardest by the climate and environmental crisis.”
Her concern over the slayings of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon drew a harsh rebuke from the Latin American nation’s president Tuesday.
“Greta said that the Indians died because they were defending the Amazon,” Jair Bolsonaro said. “It’s impressive that the press is giving space to a brat like that,” he added, using the Portuguese word ”pirralha.”
Thunberg responded by changing her bio on Twitter, where she has over 3 million followers, to say “Pirralha.”
The teenager has also been a strong advocate of science, regularly citing complex studies about the causes and impacts of climate change.
On Wednesday, Thunberg used her address at the UN’s annual climate summit to accuse governments and businesses of misleading the public by holding talks that she said aren’t going to stop the world’s “climate emergency.”
“The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR,” she said.
Thunberg cited scientific reports showing that national pledges to reduce reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions aren’t enough to meet the ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsis (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.
“This is not leading, this is misleading,” she told officials, adding that “every fraction of a degree matters.”
Thunberg said the youth climate movement, which has staged repeated worldwide protests attended by hundreds of thousands of people, has managed to spread awareness about the need to urgently emissions and help those already affected by global warming.
“To get in a sense of urgency in the conversation that is very needed right now to be able to move forward,” she said. “That, I think, is our biggest success.”
Asked whether she thought world leaders were beginning to respond to this message, Thunberg told the AP: “They say they listen and they say they understand, but it sure doesn’t seem like it.”
“If they really would listen and understand then I think they need to prove that by translating that into action,” she added.
Thunberg said the experience of the past 15 months, going from solo-protester outside the Swedish parliament to speaking in front of world leaders at the UN General Assembly, had changed her.
“I think life is much more meaningful now that I have something to do that has an impact,” she said.
Thunberg has tried to preserve some privacy despite the relentless interest she’s received from media and adoring fans.
She was mobbed on her arrival in Madrid last week and the attention paid to her appearances at the climate conference has far outstripped that of other events, save for Hollywood stars like Harrison Ford.
“I would like to be left alone,” Thunberg said when asked about her immediate plans. But before heading home to Sweden, to spend Christmas with her family and dogs, she will attend a climate protest Friday in Turin, Italy.
“After that, I have no school to return to until August because I’ve taken a gap year,” she said.
“I will probably continue a bit like now, travel around. And if I get invitations, to come. And just try everything I can,” she added.
Last year’s Time winners included slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi; the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, where five people were shot to death; Philippine journalist Maria Ressa; and two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.

The information was made public at a press conference organised jointly by Bookworm Foundation and Random Readers Society here on Tuesday.

On the occasion, the Foundation’s director Ajit Baral said that new speakers would be given a chance in response to complaints that familiar faces appeared at the forum every year.
More than 110 speakers including over a dozen foreign writers are expected to participate in the festival with more than 40 sessions. Participation of foreign writers is expected to boost the sector of Nepali literature, said Baral.
The festival’s four editions were organised in Kathmandu and the rest in Pokhara. Pokhara was picked for the festival in a bid to promote literary tourism, said Baral, adding that the venue was also shifted due to the 2015 earthquake.
The Society’s President Keshab Sharan Lamichhane claimed that the festival had helped explore Pokhara’s literature.
The DSC Award for South Asian Literature will also be presented at the festival. The award carrying a purse of USD 25,000 is an international literary prize given annually to writers of any ethnicity or nationality writing on South Asian themes such as politics, culture, history and people.

Sanna Marin, 34 from the dominant Social Democrats, was nominated on Sunday. Centre Party chief Katri Kulmuni, 32, will get the finance post when the full new cabinet is announced this week, party members said.
Finland‘s government resigned last week after the Centre Party said it had lost confidence in Social Democrat Prime Minister Antti Rinne over his handling of a postal strike.
The five parties in power – four of them led by women – decided to stay in coalition and continue with the same programmes, but said there would be a reshuffle.
“We want to make the axis between the prime minister and the finance minister work,” Kulmuni said. “That is the foundation for this new generation of collaboration (between the Social Democrats and the Centre Party),” she added.
There was no immediate comment from Marin, the former transport minister.
She has had a swift rise in Finnish politics since becoming head of the city council of her industrial hometown of Tampere at the age of 27.
She will take over in the middle of a wave of strikes, which will halt production at some of Finland‘s largest companies from Monday. The Confederation of Finnish Industries estimates the strikes will cost the companies a combined 500 million euros ($550 million) in lost revenue.
Kulmuni, who previously held the more junior position of Minister of Economic Affairs, replaces Mika Lintila. She took over as the head of the Centre Party from ex-prime minister Juha Sipila in September.
Green Party leader Maria Ohisalo, 34, will continue as interior minister, the Left Alliance’s chairwoman Li Andersson, 32, as education minister and the Swedish People’s Party’s Anna-Maja Henriksson, 55, as justice minister.
Rinne will remain the Social Democrats leader at least until he chairs the party’s conference in June.

213,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australia-braces-for-more-fires-as-extreme-temperatures-predicted/,"SYDNEY: Thousands of firefighters were fortifying containment lines on Monday as temperatures were forecast to soar, increasing the danger of a fresh wave of bushfires across Australia‘s east coast.
More 100 fires remain ablaze in the region, and authorities warned conditions would worsen on Tuesday when temperatures were predicted to top 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).
Seeking to minimise the threat, firefighters safely burned grassland around homes to remove fuel, said NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.
“Firefighters are trying to take advantage of the more moderate conditions… and establish as many significant containment options as they can,” Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. “It is an enormous amount of work with more than 2,000 people out in the field.”
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Such fires are common in Australia‘s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring this year have caught many by surprise. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
In the small city of Hawkesbury, about 50 km (31.1 miles) north-west of Sydney, residents joined firefighters to safeguard their properties.
Mayor Barry Calvert said residents were trying to clear foliage from around their homes, and opening gates to ensure emergency workers have access.
Calvert said many locals were struggling to move animals and livestock in an area renowned for breeding racehorses.
“We’ve opened the showground for people to move their animals, but many people here may have 20 horses and only two horse boxes so they can’t move them quickly,” Calvert told Reuters.
The wildfires have blanketed Sydney – home to more the 5 million people – in smoke and ash for more than a week, turning the daytime sky orange, obscuring visibility and prompting commuters to wear breathing masks.
Australia‘s worst bushfires on record destroyed thousands of homes in Victoria state in February 2009, killing 173 people and injuring 414.

In the book launch interaction held with veteran writers, sociologists and mediapersons, in Kathmandu, on Saturday, litterateur and writer Nayanraj Pandey said the novel ‘Dulari’ elaborated troubles and difficulties faced by Dalit communities especially Musahar.
He said novelist Muna Chaudhary has step-by-step presented the economic exploitation imposed by society on people from marginalised communities and added that the author also cleverly uses Tharu terms and has described them in Nepali to make readers understand. Pandey, however, pointed out that readers would have to keep patience as the main plot unfolds very slowly as the story develops.

Likewise, sociologist Priyanka Kapar said the novel was equally suitable for people from different walks of life as it has touched on the reality of the present state of affairs in Tarai. She said the novel compelled her to recollect how Tharu people practised the ‘untouchability’ with various Dalit communities. She said she was impressed with the author’s way of addressing how women lose their names after getting married in Tarai. However, she pointed out that the novel lacks a historical background of the Musahar community.
Similarly, publishing team member Anbika Giri thanked author Chaudhary for her effort to write a novel on the isolated story. She said the story matches reality as it includes the conditions of people reeling under poverty in Tarai.
Novelist Muna Chaudhary said she found her aspiration to write the novel from her day-to-day experiences and her encouraging husband. She said the novel presents the story of a woman born in a Dalit community and the difficulties and challenges she faces due to limitation set against a marginalised community. The story is narrated from a woman’s perspective.
Muna Chaudhary, who is also treasurer member of ‘Tharu Sahitya Kendra’, has worked on two short stories — ‘Machan’ and ‘Chat’.

There were 96 fires burning in New South Wales, home to Australia’s largest city of Sydney, with only about a half contained and more than 1,600 firefighters deployed to do back burning and create containment lines.
Sydney with its population of 5.2 million has been blanketed by unhealthy haze and smoke for weeks, with conditions worsening on Friday as several fires merged into a giant blaze that may take weeks to put out.
Australia has been through some devastating bushfires before during its hot summers, but fire officials have said that this earlier-than-usual wave of fires has been one of the most persistent and largest.
NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told Australia’s ABC television on Sunday that temperatures will be raising to above normal by Tuesday, reaching 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), threatening the spread of the fires and new blazes.
More smoke is to be expected around Sydney on Sunday as firefighters will do preventive work.
“Crews are going to be actively out there lighting up large tracts of land, kilometres of trails and tracks, and getting into bushland areas in an attempt to bring those fires under control and start putting it into consolidation with containment lines,” Fitzsimmons said.
The fires have been blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson and with much of the country under a long-lasting drought, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been under pressure to address the impact of climate change.
In mid-November, 14 mayors of fire-stricken areas signed a letter urging the government to acknowledge a correlation between climate change and the devastating bushfires, asking also for more funds.
While some additional money has been provided, Morrison has repeatedly rejected any links between the fires and his conservative policies, including support for the coal industry.
On Saturday, the government issued a report suggesting that Australia is on track to meet its emission reduction target, which under the Paris Agreement calls for the country to reduce its emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2030.
The government acknowledged, however, that it uses so-called carryover credits, which allow for counting emissions reduction from the past towards future targets – a practice criticised by the European Union and Pacific countries threatened by climate change.

According to Police Inspector Sheshak Ram Thamdar at the Area Police Office (APO), Tehrathum, the body of the deceased was recovered from Seti Bagar, near Phakwuwa Dobhan. Inspector Thamdar added that the body was found by Dhan Bahadur Majhi of Panchthar while he was fishing in the river.
Majhi informed the police when he saw the body, following which a team from the Aathrai-based APO reached the site and carried out an investigation to confirm it was Mandira’s body. It has been reported that Mandira’s kin identified her on the basis of the bangles that she’d been wearing.

Mandira,19, who had been missing from her home since December 3, was murdered at Fulbari of Athrai Triveni Rural Municipality, Taplejung. Ramesh Adhikari of Hangpang in Taplejung confessed to killing Mandira and throwing her body into Tamor river.
After Ramesh confessed to the crime committed by him, police from Taplejung, Panchthar, Tehrathum and Dhankuta along with locals had started searching for the body, but to no avail, until now.
Mandira had gone missing after she received a phone call on the evening of December 3. Police arrested Ramesh on December 25 after family members suspected his involvement in Mandira’s disappearance. She was a 12th grader at local Durga Secondary School. Ramesh had lived for a long time in a rented room at Mandira’s house.
Chandra Adhikari, Mandira’s uncle, earlier said that Ramesh had sent a message from Mandira’s Facebook account to her sister Alisha after the murder. The message read that she had married a boy from Jhapa. This was an attempt on Ramesh’s part to create a situation which would justify Mandira’s disappearance.
Police investigation has also revealed that Ramesh and Mandira, who were related to one another, were also attached romantically, and he might have murdered her thinking she would create problems for him to marry another girl.

“The issues that have been the subjects of our talks all these months will be resolved unanimously within the party before tabling it in the Provincial Assembly on January 6,” said the CM, adding that the meeting would last till tomorrow.
It is important to note that following the NCP secretariat’s decision on the issues of province name and its headquarters and instruction to implement the decision, Province 3 government has already recommended the provincial chief to call to order a PA meeting for January 6.
Meanwhile, it has given rise to the discussion within the party over the secretariat’s act of dictating the provincial government on the issues that, according to the constitution, fall under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Assembly.
While some have defended the party’s high command’s act, others have criticised it, saying it was an act of ‘bigfooting’ in the Provincial Assembly’s jurisdiction.
As per the law, the proposals related to the issue of province headquarters and name must be rectified by two thirds majority of the Provincial Assembly to be valid.
So, it is said that the party is now preparing to table the proposal only after holding internal discussion at the province level.

Many parts of Nepal reeled under cold weather today as light rain brought down temperatures across the country. Kathmandu was shrouded in a blanket of fog where maximum temperature fell by almost half to 9.9 degrees Celsius today, down from 18 degrees Celsius yesterday.
A rapid fall in maximum temperature makes the day chillier. Kathmandu reported a minimum temperature of five degrees Celsius.
Meteorological Forecasting Division stated that maximum temperature would go up moderately tomorrow. “So, tomorrow won’t be as cold as today,” said Min Kumar Aryal, a meteorologist. But Kathmandu will witness light rain tomorrow as well, according to the division. It has predicted weather to improve in Kathmandu only after Sunday.
The inclement weather is the result of ‘western low pressure’ which triggered rains, according to MFD.
Kathmandu reported 3.8 mm rainfall today, whereas Pokhara saw 30 mm and Dipayal received the highest 62.3 mm of rainfall in the country. The ‘low wind pressure’ is also expected to trigger snowfall in high hilly and mountainous areas.
“There are clouds laden with moisture in the hills above 3,000 m, therefore snowfall is likely,” Aryal said.
MFD records weather in 19 places across the country. Among them, Jiri recorded maximum temperature of one degree Celsius and a minimum temperature of — 0.5 degree Celsius today.
The maximum temperature in Jiri stood at 14.5 degrees Celsius yesterday and the minimum hovered around 0.1 degree Celsius. Mercury level also remained low in Bhairahawa today where maximum temperature stood at 15.5 degrees Celsius and minimum at 13.9 degrees Celsius.
The sudden change in weather has affected daily lives across the country with many staying indoors, but no untoward incident has been reported so far.
The foggy weather and drizzle also affected movement of international and domestic flights in the capital today, as visibility remained low.
At least five international flights of Sichuan Airlines, Nepal Airlines, Thai Airways, Salam Air and Air China headed to Kathmandu were diverted to Lhasa, New Delhi, Kolkata, Patna and Chengdu, respectively. Sichuan Airlines, Air China and Qatar Airways also cancelled their flights from Kathmandu. A few afternoon domestic flights were also cancelled, but their number could not be confirmed.
The flights could not operate as visibility fell to 800 m in the morning. but it gradually improved to 6 km in the afternoon, according to Raju Pradhananga, a senior meteorologist. “Visibility falls when moisture in the atmosphere is not absorbed because of the lack of sunlight,” said Pradhananga.  “We expect visibility to remain low tomorrow morning as well but the situation will improve by afternoon.”

Ink five-point pact with govt
Mills to clear farmers’ dues

Kathmandu, January 3
Sugarcane farmers today withdrew their week-long protest after inking a five-point agreement with the government that included an assurance that sugar mill operators would be made to clear their outstanding dues by January 21.
Dinesh Bhattarai, joint secretary at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Supplies, and Hari Shyam Raya, representing the farmers, put their initials on the agreement today.
The agreement mentions that the ministry would form a task force under the coordination of Bhattarai and comprise farmers, sugar industrialists and experts, to identify a sustainable solution to the issue of delayed payment to sugarcane farmers that makes headlines every year.
The task force will also study the status of sugarcane farming, ways to increase productivity, provide fertilisers to farmers on time, make the country self-reliant on sugar and manage sugar mills.
The ministry added that it would immediately send a letter to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development and the Ministry of Finance requesting them to release the subsidy that farmers were supposed to receive.
The government had to pay Rs 1.34 billion subsidy to sugarcane farmers in the last fiscal year. Though it did release Rs 920 million of the total subsidy, the farmers are yet to receive it. The government has been providing subsidy of Rs 60 per quintal to sugarcane farmers.
According to today’s agreement, the ministry will turn its Supply Management Division into Communications Division. Farmers will be able to register their complaints at this division in case they do not receive payment for their produce from industrialists.
The industrialists can also raise their concerns at the division if they face any problem while supplying sugar.
The ministry claimed that sugar mill owners had come in contact with the ministry and had agreed to clear farmers’ dues. “The ministry held frequent discussions with the farmers and industrialists over the past week. Even mill operators who were out of contact earlier are now in touch with us and have agreed to clear farmers’ dues,” the ministry stated.
It is to be noted, however, that the government had inked such agreements with cane farmers earlier also, but had failed to implement them.

The goal is to upgrade the hospital from the present 100-bed capacity to 300-bed capacity health facility and promote Jhapa as the medical hub, said Durga Prasai, the Hospital’s executive director.
Of the patients receiving treatment in Medanta and Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital in India, Nepali patients are said to account for the third highest number in recent years. There is no exact data on how many Nepalis go to these two hospitals for treatment.
According to Jhapa Public Health Office, last year 400 cancer patients had sought its recommendation to go abroad for treatment.
The World Health Organisation’s projection shows that annually more than 15,000 people in Nepal die due to various types of cancer. Only 30 per cent of the patients survive after treatment and 70 per cent succumbed untimely to cancer.

Nepal Electricity Authority, Bajura, started supplying power to people through the national transmission line for the first time in the district from yesterday.
The electricity service was supplied following the connection of transmission line in five houses at Sera of Budhiganga Municipality-3.
Nepal Electricity Authority, Bajura Distribution Centre Assistant Chief Padam Bahadur Bam said a 50 KV transmitter was connected to the houses of locals Ranga Rana, Bhakta Rana, Lal Bahadur Damai, Janga Rawal and Karna Rawal.
The locals looked elated after NEA supplied electricity to their houses for the first time.
Electricity poles were installed in almost all places in a bid to provide electricity service at wards 1, 2 and 3 of Budhiganga Municipality from the national transmission line.
Mayor Dipak Bikram Shah of the municipality said electricity service would be accessible to those places within two months. He said the NEA had aimed to supply power to 1,000 households.
“Earlier, the municipality had allocated over four million rupees for management of electricity. Electricity supply was managed from the national transmission line in coordination with the NEA,” he said.
According to NEA Distribution Centre, Bajura, the electricity was supplied to some houses in the first phase from the national transmission line and it would be expanded to other areas gradually.

People’s representatives in Rautahat have doubted that the high-level commission set up to investigate cases of land grab and misuse of public land will take action against the persons involved in seizing government and public land in the district.
Speaking at a programme organised at the meeting hall of the District Coordination Committee in Rautahat district headquarters Gaur today, the representatives cited the fact that hardly anyone involved in appropriating public and government property have been booked anywhere so far and doubted that the persons involved in such acts would be punished for their wrong act.
It’s a challenge for the state now to bring back the land plots belonging to Gaur Rice Mills, Naryan Guthi, Purenawa Guthi, Ishnath Mahadev temple and District Forest Office that were secretly transferred to individual ownership by unduly influencing government employees, they observed.
“How on earth have land plots distributed to squatters been transferred to the names of well-off persons? How can those land plots be returned?” wondered Katahariya Municipality Mayor Siyaram Kushawaha.
Dewahi Gonahi Municipality Mayor Dharmendra Patel, Rajdevi Municipality Mayor Dhirendra Singh, Chandrapur Municipality Mayor Ramchandra Chaudhary and Yamunamai Rural Municipality Chair Shree Prakash Mukhiya, among others, observed that though the local bodies were capable of vacating the encroached lands, the same hadn’t been possible due to lack of knowledge about legal procedures.
Socialist Party-Nepal Central Member Rawanta Jha accused the commission of failing to take action even against those involved in encroaching government land in Kathmandu.
On his part, Commission Member Janakibballav Adhikari conveyed that the commission was working as per its mandate and was committed to bringing under the remit of law everyone involved in grabbing and misusing public property. He also urged the local journalists, civil society and local level representatives to inform the commission about any cases of land grab and misuse of public land in the district.

Responsibilities of all wards in Likhutamakoshi Rural Municipality have been given to a ward secretary for the past two years in Ramechhap.
Ward Secretary Keharman Tamang has been looking after all the works of all seven wards in the rural municipality due to lack of staffers.
Chair of the rural municipality Govinda Bahadur Khadka said that the authority concerned had not appointed staffers in the last two years. “One person has been burdened with the responsibility of all the wards and due to this service seekers are not getting quick and easy service,” he added.
He has been working as acting chief administrative officer after the then administrative officer Bhupendra Rai left the office due to a dispute with Chairman Khadka. “There are no staffers in the office except me, and I have been looking after all the works,” Tamang said. He said that he had been providing service to service seekers from the rural municipality office. “It has been very difficult for me to oversee the works of all seven wards,” he added.
Daily works of the rural municipality office have been affected due to lack of staffers in the office. A local, Ronila Magar, of Ward No 5 said that she had to reach the rural municipality office even for minor work. She said that people were compelled to reach the office for death, birth and marriage registration and for citizenship certificate recommendation.

According to court Registrar Gunaraj Parajulee, a single bench of district judge Umanath Gautam on Monday issued the verdict on a four-year-old case in which two Indian nationals had obtained Nepali citizenship certificates fraudulently. The court slapped a fine of 25,000 rupees each on Mayor Kushawaha and 20 others for abetting the fraud.

“The court has also revoked the Nepali citizenship certificates obtained by the Indian nationals and slapped them with a fine of Rs 50,000 each,” said Parajulee, adding that the full details of the verdict are, however, yet to come.
Further, the registrar informed that the verdict was issued in response to an FIR filed by Kathmandu’s Santa Bahadur Shrestha about four years ago that two Indian nationals, namely Hafij Dewan, aged 68, and Oli Mahamad Dewan Fakir, 55, from Purbi Champaran in the Indian state of Bihar had managed to procure Nepali citizenship certificate by presenting fake documents.
The duo’s father Mir Hasan Dewan Fakir is temporarily residing in Rautahat’s Hathiyahi.

The National Assembly today unanimously adopted a stricture, directing the government to intensify the ongoing diplomatic initiative and launch high-level political efforts to resolve Nepal-India border dispute in the Kalapani region.
Proposed by ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) NA Chief Whip Khim Lal Bhattarai and supported by main opposition Nepali Congress NA Chief Whip Sarita Prasain, the stricture also directed the government to take to logical conclusion the initiative taken by Nepal-India High-Level Technical Committee on resolving border-related issues.

Presenting the stricture in the House, Bhattarai said the entire nation’s attention had been drawn towards the recently-published Indian political map that depicted the Kalapani region comprising Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani as Indian territory.
“Against the backdrop of unprecedented national unity, we table this stricture to make
sure the government takes stronger diplomatic and high-level political initiatives to keep Nepali land free of encroachment and to ensure Indian security forces stationed in the Kalapani region are withdrawn,” said Bhattarai presenting the stricture in the House.
He said Nepal was claiming the Kalapani region as its territory not on the basis of arguments, but on the basis of historical facts and proofs. “As per the international river principle, the Mahakali River’s origin is Limpiyadhura and the region on the eastern side is Nepali territory,” said Bhattarai.
Prasain said the government should hold dialogue with India based on historical facts and proofs. “We present this stricture jointly as we rise above partisan interests on an issue as sensitive as national boundary,” she said.
Nepali Congress lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari said Nepal-India relations were multi-dimensional and that the government needed to ensure Nepal’s relations with India were not jeopardised while trying to resolve border-related issues.
In his reply, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pradeep Kumar Gyawali said Nepal-India borders were determined by the Sugauli Treaty of 4 March 1816 and three other subsequent treaties.
According to Gyawali, the Sugauli Treaty map determined Nepal’s border on the eastern (Mechi River) and western sides (Kali River), whereas the treaty of 8 December 1816 determined Nepal’s borders on the southern side (from Koshi River to Rapti River). The treaty of 1823 ensured Nepal got back Banke, Bardiya, Kailali and Kanchanpur, and the treaty of 7 January 1875 determined Daduwa watershed of Dang as Nepal-India border.
Gyawali said several maps — Sugauli Treaty-era map, 1827 map prepared by British Survey of India, 1844 Almora map, 1850 Kumaon-Garhwal map and 1856 map — proved that Limpiyadhura was the origin of the Kali River. He said after the 1950s, India renamed the Kali River as West Kali and designated another river originating from Lipulekh, some 50 km east, as the Kali River. It shifted the border further 17-18 km east by determining another river as Kali River by placing Lipulekh and Kalapani on the western side, added Gyawali. “This way, Nepali land was encroached upon, first in the map and then physically by stationing security forces in 1962,” said Gyawali. “However, none of the successive Nepali governments has agreed to that map,” he added.
Gyawali said Nepal had forwarded a diplomatic note to India on November 20 requesting it to hold dialogue and India responded positively on December 19. “India has acknowledged the problem and has expressed urgency to solve it,” he said. “We are working on a mutually-convenient date to hold dialogue. The government is confident the issue can be resolved through diplomatic efforts,” added Gyawali.

Indian Gurkha Arjun Thapa Magar, 25, who hailed from Thulo Rip village of Gorkha Municipality, was killed in an exchange of fire with militants in a forest in Naushera sector of Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday night, according to Indian media.
Rifleman Arjun, who had joined the Indian army four years ago, was talking to his wife Sarita in Gorkha on Tuesday night at around 11:00 pm when he told his wife that he had to rush to counter an enemy attack and hung up, according to Arjun’s nephew Sujit Thapa Magar.
Sarita then tried to call her husband, but his phone was switched off. She slept worrying about the fate of her husband. The next morning she received a message on her phone that there was bad news for the family. “It got everybody in the family worried. After a while somebody from the Indian army called the family and said Arjun had attained martyrdom in the line of duty,” Sujit said.
Family members have gone to Kakarbhitta to receive Arjun’s body. They have been told that the body would arrive tomorrow morning. “I heard that the Indian army helicopter could not fly the body of my uncle today to Kakarbhitta due to bad weather and they would try to bring it to Pani Tanki, Kakarbhitta, tomorrow,” Sujit said. He added that the family had not decided yet whether they would cremate the fallen solider in Kakarbhitta or at his birth place in Gorkha.
“My uncle had dreamt of becoming a Lahure all his childhood. He got the job on the second attempt and was glad to be an Indian Gurkha,” Sujit said.
Arjun had married seven months ago and had returned to duty 12 days ago after spending a month with his family in Gorkha.
According to Hindustan Times, Naik Sawant Sandip Raghunath, 29, from Maharashtra and Arjun were injured in the exchange of fire and succumbed to their injuries.

276,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-clear-the-dues/,"Instead of lifting the farmers out of poverty, the unscrupulous ways of doing business only pushes them deeper into debt and destitution
With the government fixing the support price of sugarcane for this season, sugar mills have started operation, but many farmers are in no mood to sell their produce until the mills clear their outstanding dues to them. Sugarcane farmers from across the country have gathered in the capital, braving the bone-chilling cold, to draw the attention of the government towards their plight. The sugar mills owe a whopping Rs 1.5 billion in uncleared payments to the farmers, with one operator, Rakesh Kumar Agrawal, of Annapurna Sugar and General Industries and Indira Sugar and Agro Industries, alone failing to pay a third of that amount. The farmers are at the receiving end as they have taken loans from the banks or moneylenders to grow sugarcane, but neither the mill owners nor the provincial or local officials will listen to their clamour to be paid. But this time, following much hullaballo in the media, the government has taken a firm stand to punish the sugar mills if need be so that justice is done to the farmers.
The government has given assurances that the mills would clear all dues by the third week of January. They might even get 80 per cent of outstanding dues within the next 10 days. On Monday the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, had asked the Ministry of Home to swing into action against the stubborn sugar mills. The police have been directed to look for Rakesh Kumar, in particular, and have him presented at the Industry Ministry. This is simply disgraceful. There are 14 sugar mills in the country that produce about 1.75 lakh tons of sugar annually by crushing 26 million tons of sugarcane grown by tens of thousands of petty farmers. The country consumes about 250,000 tons of sugar, and the shortfall is met through imports from mostly India and Pakistan, which is cheaper than domestic production.
The tendency of the private sugar mills to profit heavily by taking undue advantage of the unorganised, voiceless farmers is not only illegal and unethical, but also criminal in nature. Surprisingly, the business community has remained largely silent on the issue. When someone from among their flock engages in unethical practices, it is the duty of their apex bodies, namely the Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Confederation of Nepalese industries and Nepal Chamber of Commerce to speak up and show no tolerance. How can you expect agro-industry to foster in the country when the farmers are unsure if they will be paid for the produce they sell? Instead of lifting the farmers out of poverty, the unscrupulous ways of doing business adopted by some only pushes them deeper into debt and destitution. The government must make sure that the mill owners clear all their dues to the farmers within the stipulated timeframe as promised by them, failing which the authorities must use whatever option it takes to do so. The mills would do well to stop whining all the time about the high cost of production in Nepal, and refrain from duping the farmers and government time and again for petty gains.

Pads to schoolgirls
As per its policies and programmes for fiscal 2018/19, the government is all set to provide sanitary pads free of charge to all adolescent girls studying in community schools. The Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration published a notice to this effect on Wednesday. The main objective of the scheme is to improve menstrual hygiene of adolescent girls and solve the problem of absenteeism and drop-outs among them during the periods.
The government has allocated budget for all community schools as conditional grants to run the scheme from December-end 2019 to mid-July 2020. As per the scheme, a girl student of a community school in remote districts is entitled to pads worth Rs 1,096, while a girl student up to Grade XII in other districts will get Rs 977 every year. The local levels will ascertain the number of girls in the community schools and distribute them accordingly. The quality of the sanitary pads will be determined by the Ministry of Health and Population. Rules have also been set about the proper disposal of the used pads. While it is a welcome move of the government, the capacity of the concerned local levels must be strengthened about the ways of their proper distribution.

As I walk up towards a lonely building, I’m greeted languidly by despondent and drying vegetation. I come upon confused faces and bodies hovering near rusting, slim windows. Carefully, they listen to voices babbling from inside a room, stare unflinchingly with knotted brows before breaking eye contact. Systematically, bodies shift from one window to another.
I ask timidly where I should go with the papers in my hands. Everyone waits on somebody else’s response, so all I receive are muted stares. A young man behind me musters some courage and attempts to find an actual door for whatever it’s worth. I choose to ally with Brave Soul and walk behind him. At the first door, he apprehensively slides his body and dares to peek inside. He, too, timidly asks where he should go with his papers.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Brave Soul is snapped at by a voice springing from a corner of this colourless room. When it shrieks at us to go outside and wait like everyone, Brave Soul lets out a sharp gasp, and lets the door shut at our faces. We return outside into the light, searching for the next move. An invisible hand points to a small, green bulletin board, until then, we had shown contempt for. Pinned to it were a number of papers containing bullet points of demands in a language to which I clearly display remarkable ineptitude.
I look at Brave Soul’s intense eyes dart from left to right simultaneously mouthing the words. Finishing, he turns to face my searching eyes and says that I should be in the next building. So does he. He hops on his motorcycle and speeds off. I walk as briskly as I can so I can give my misery company.
Upon entering, I meet faces painted with certainty and strides of determination this time. A familiar voice shouts at me to ask the security guard for a tear of flimsy paper. Brave Soul is already standing in a line snaking out from a dark window. I nod obediently. The security guard asks me why I need the form, and I give the only answer I know; to apply for an equivalency certificate. He tears it, hands me a flimsy piece of paper and two words: you’re late.
In a parallel universe, I tell him that that makes me a perfect Nepali before spinning on my heels and marching off. Reality documents me cowering apologetically, dampening the form in my hands. I seek Brave Soul’s next advice. He instructs me to find the Voucher Man who bears a protruding belly caged inside a puffer jacket. He dons the Dhaka Topi as well. Before I can completely exhale, I spot the Voucher Man dragging a weather-beaten plastic chair onto the middle of a motorable road to bask in the sun. I can’t believe my luck as I request the necessary voucher. He waves me away as if I were a housefly bothering his pleasant winter sun. Arriving easily at my wits’ end, I call up Father to check on his whereabouts when he fails to arrive on time for my rescue.
Brave Soul asks if I received the voucher. Seeing my glum face, he teaches me to try again; this time with a beseeching voice. He adds that I should mention as dispiritedly as possible that I’ve come from afar and my fate rests only upon favour. I piece together some courage to work up facial muscles and a matching voice. I let Brave Soul’s voice echo in my head. Be apologetic. Show reverence. Above all, acknowledge his hubris. I return to the Voucher Man only to be swept away, so I resign myself to a corner not too far from him where we both continue to face each other.
Throughout his conversation with his lackeys, he throws glances in my direction from where I churn out various dejected looks until one of them disconcerts his bureaucratic inertia. At long last, the benevolent one has been appeased, so he signals at me discreetly. Sheepishly, I wait as he talks in a low voice. Voucher Man says that he is giving me the voucher outside of office hours, so I must not share this classified act. He furtively pulls out a bank voucher folded in thirds that I stealthily slip into my pocket. I return him a quick, firm nod with a brief whisper of thanks. I allow my heart to be elated and my mind to believe that I’ve been looked upon favourably.
Father finally returns my call, and I tell him to hurry before my precious favour ebbs away. By the time Father maneuvers himself out of the traffic congestion, I’m one of the three people left. The second he puts his scooter on a stand, he rushes to read the demands offending his presbyopia (long-sightedness), so he rummages through his bag for his reading glasses. I wait on him when I hear a muffled voice behind me; Voucher Man stands belly out.
He tells me to go to a particular window to complete my paperwork and end my misery. On that same train of monologue, he mentions that I haven’t made good use of his compassionate act. I want to display some of my dejected faces to earn more sympathy, but time isn’t putting up with it. Father and I rush to the counter only to have the window shut.
Voucher Man is long gone. Father says we could try again tomorrow. Deeply I inhale and decide that I will defeat this Goliath somehow. I make a plan for the day after, inquiring with the security guard of the opening hours and papers to submit. Because many of the words in my question are injected distastefully with English, he doesn’t hesitate in asking if my papers are foreign, to which I reply yes. With a straight face, he tells me I’m in the wrong department. I think to myself that I’m nowhere near Goliath’s foot.

278,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/fermentation-a-magical-touch/,"I still remember when my father told me yoghurt is made by germs, I wondered how. I slowly came to know about it when I pursued a career as a food technologist. The process is called fermentation, where beneficial bacteria, yeast and mould convert food into something more nutritious, palatable and healthy by enhancing its quality, texture and shelf life. Examples of fermented food are khalpi (cucumber pickle), gundruk, tama (bamboo shoots) and cheese.
Our gastronomic culture is rich and diversified, from the Himalayas to the hills and plains of the Tarai. Different altitude, climate and weather conditions have helped us to create many dishes. Similarly we keep a pantry of ethnic fermented foods, like gundruk, mesu, sinki, khalpi, liquor, sidra, sukuti, selroti, churpi, dahi and masyaura. These dishes represent different types of fermentation – lactic acid fermentation, acetic acid fermentation, alcoholic fermentation and alkaline fermentation.
Potential health benefits of fermented foods are a reduction in hypertension, low cholesterol level, obesity control, thrombosis and lowered diabetes risk. Why fermented food contributes to good health is the availability of active bio compounds and vitamins like B2, B9, B12 while potassium is high in fermented food.
Fermented food may contain live beneficial bacteria too, which are equally beneficial for health. With more research going on in human microbiome, it has been already proved that the health of an individual also depends on gut health, and fermented foods play an important role in maintaining the ecosystem of the beneficial gut bacteria, which in turn helps to maintain the health of person.
As science comes up with more interesting facts about fermentation and fermented foods, they have started becoming popular items on the menu in high-end restaurant. People have started taking it as a rare food hard to find while the real story is that twenty years back, foods such as gundruk, mesu, kinema, tama, mula ko achar, khalpi, curd and masyaura were the regular foodstuffs in every house. While fermented foods are getting more attention in the western world, we seem to be indulging more in processed foods. We might have forgotten that our gastronomic culture and fermented ethnic foods could be the solution to many health issues. Therefore, fermentation is a magical touch that uplifts the overall quality of food.

279,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-respect-the-house/,"It is regrettable to see the ruling party using the sovereign Parliament as its rubber stamp by deferring its meeting for weeks
Thirteen days have already passed since President Bidhya Devi Bhandari called the winter session, or bill session, of the Federal Parliament on December 20 upon the recommendation of the council of ministers and the Parliament Secretariat. But the House of Representatives (HoR) has failed to convene even a single meeting during those days, and it has been postponed twice, now till January 12. On December 27,  the Parliament Secretariat had postponed the HoR meeting by putting up a notice until January 1. The main agenda of the HoR is to elect the new Speaker following the resignation of then Speaker, Krishna Bahadur Mahara, on charges of attempting to rape an employee at the Secretariat. As the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) has absolute majority in the Lower House, it should field its candidacy for the Speakership. But the party leadership is still undecided on who should become the Speaker’s candidate, largely because of the conflict of interest between the Co-Chairs – PM KP Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal – of the party. As a result, the HoR has been held hostage to the party’s indecision. PM Oli wants an ‘experienced’ person from the erstwhile CPN-UML while Dahal and his supporters want someone from the then CPN-MC to lead the HoR as per the earlier understanding reached between them before their unification.
It is unlikely that the HoR session will commence anytime soon unless the co-chairs break the ice over the Speaker’s candidacy. But their indecision has given a message to the public that the sovereign Parliament is under the shadow of the ruling party’s internal conflict. Both the leaders had held extensive discussion on Tuesday on electing members to the 18 vacant seats in the National Assembly and candidacy for the HoR Speaker. But they could not reach any deal on who should file the candidacy for Speaker as both stuck to their guns. In the meantime, the main opposition, the Nepali Congress, has accused the ruling party of disrespecting the Parliament by deferring its meeting time and again. Many had assumed that the winter session had been called after both the leaders had decided on the Speaker’s choice.
It will not augur well for both the ruling party and the government to defer the House session for more than three weeks simply because the party in power is undecided on who should become the Speaker. Since the Deputy Speaker cannot exercise the Speaker’s executive power, the election process of the HoR head should have taken place from day one of the commencement of the Parliament. Due to the absence of the Speaker, seven bills already passed by the previous session have not been certified by the Speaker. Likewise, the government has also tabled as many as 40 bills at the Secretariat to be endorsed by both the Houses. As the Parliament is a sovereign body, its functions and duties should be determined by the House rules, and it should not act like a rubber stamp of the ruling party. Everybody – the government and the ruling party in this case – must follow the due process of the constitution and long-held parliamentary practices. In this case, the ruling party has disrespected the Parliament by not allowing it to elect its leader on time as per its set rules.

Curbing sharp practice
Kathmandu is a melting pot, where people from across the country come to earn a living. Not everyone can afford to buy a house immediately, so they rent one or just a room so that they can have a roof over their head when they return from work in the evening. Nepalis apart, foreigners are also increasingly renting homes as they go about doing business in the capital. The government would not have had any qualms about people coming to the capital and living in rented houses were it not for the increasing number of crimes that are taking place here. From theft, robbery and sexual crimes to swindling, cyber crime and banking fraud, involving both Nepalis and foreigners, there has been no let up to criminal activities here, and it has become necessary for the government to know what the denizens are doing.
Against this backdrop, the Home Ministry’s bid to collect personal information of the landlords and their tenants, and the type of business or organisation they are operating is welcome. It is the duty of the landlords to furnish the required information so that the police can work on the record and improve the law and order situation in the capital.

Aren’t “good” or “bad” themselves adjectives, thus subject to interpretation and perception of the person who remarks something to be good or bad?
A few months ago, a friend had a bad but rewarding experience at a job interview in a school at Lalitpur with the interviewer, none other than the principal. My friend, at the very beginning of the interview, received a bad rap from the interviewer over his appearance. My friend did not find it necessary to follow the stereotype of an exaggeratedly groomed person and showed up for the interview in his casual apparel and, of course, with his long but well-organised hair and beard, which he had always been quite comfortable in.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
But the principal’s crass judgement about his appearance sapped him of his fervour for the interview, and he could not reciprocate the interviewer’s questions and remarks effectively (in English). This led the interviewer to believe that my friend was just a run-off-the-mill college graduate desperate to get a job on the basis of his mere college degree.
But wait a minute, still water runs deep! What my friend told the interviewer in response to his cheap and off-the-cuff remark steered the whole interview to a U-turn. He asked my friend how many asterisks he had received on his academic mark sheet, implying how many times he had failed before getting through all the subjects.
All of a sudden, the interviewer, who until then was in no mood to hire my friend on the basis of his exterior and the inability to tell things in fluent English, was now ready to accept my friend as an editor of his new science textbook, when my friend told him that he had graduated in science with physics major, securing 82% and then had secured third position in the merit list in the M.Sc (physics) entrance exam at the Central Department of Physics, Kirtipur.
He also revealed that he had co-authored two books on chemistry for the bachelor’s students apart from teaching them chemistry.
This incident serves as a point of departure for me in this write-up.
Even educated lots like the principal of that school ended up being tempted to judge someone on the basis of the shallow attributes like spoken English skills and physical appearance – something totally irrelevant for the required eligibility criteria for a teaching post. How easily he forgot that command in English does not necessarily serve as a measure of intelligence and wisdom.
Regarding the physical appearance, how the likes of him in our society forget that the dynamism of our society will sustain so long as every one of us learns to respect each other’s physical, social and cultural attributes. Isn’t being a teacher about inspiring kids to develop the autonomy of their thoughts, after all? If we teach our kids that such and such outer and changeable attributes of men and women are synonymous with being a member of that particular gender, then how can we create gender equality?  How can we justify short hair of women if we cannot take the long pony tails of men normally? If a person with long hair is synonymous with being something of a goonda, then why should we extol all those philosophers and scientists?
On a similar note, recently, my “long” hair and beard happened to kick up an uncalled-for uproar and tongue-wagging among my colleagues when I returned to work after my month-long festival holidays. My hair received a bad rap because I, always a clean-shaven person before, appeared in a beard, and people, surprisingly, had the free time and energy to involve themselves in the chain of gossips regarding my new look.
In a bid to respond to the gossips and make their presence felt, the school administration summoned me to remonstrate about my long hair because they say school teachers should not grow long hair as it sends a “wrong message” to the children. What is unsettling to me is that on the one hand we boast of following modern norms and values, which obviously involve individual liberty, but on the other hand we tend to dictate how a person should groom himself/herself. It is totally incongruous for employers to impose a particular kind of hairstyle and specific kind of dress on their employees unless it is absolutely required by the kind of job they are in.
To break the monotony or to challenge the stereotypical look of a teacher or to experiment with a new look, I grew a beard during the month-long festival holidays. When I looked at myself in the mirror I felt very confident and comfortable about my new look. Let me reiterate, whatever be the shades of opinion about my appearance, I felt confident and comfortable.
Fashion, trend or whatever you call it, is all about that, isn’t it? One of my executives expressed his objection over my long hair, asking what if one day I chose to keep dreadlocks. “Should we go to the lengths of allowing this, too?” he questioned empathetically. “You, I or anyone for that matter are not to dictate what is ok and how much is ok when it comes to people’s interest and choices,” said I.
Is it really that people of a certain profession should be in conformity with the stereotypical image of a person in that profession? What is a good look or bad look? Who sets the benchmark for them and what are they? Aren’t “good” or “bad” themselves adjectives, thus subject to interpretation and perception of the person who remarks something to be good or bad? The bottom-line of my argument is: let people be what they want to be as long as it is not impinging upon someone else’s right.

281,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/reunion-with-curiosity/,"Once my manager had said this to me, “Curiosity kills the cat. Don’t be too curious.” He was one of those elder authorities whose comments and feedback were considered worthy in our organisation.  His hold on English grammar and vocabulary was quite good.
During those early times of my professional life, the sudden comment of his broke my heart. It shook my confidence level. For more than a decade, I used to feel sorry for myself for being curious. How incorrect he was in the usage, and how wrong I was to accept it as it was!
After a decade and a half, when I was reading the Golden Versions of God Shiva, I discovered that curiosity is the specialty of my soul. Whatever I am and wherever I have reached is because of this inbuilt trait of curiosity. Because of the eagerness to know or learn about something, I have overcome so many mountain-like challenges in life. My trainer, Varun, told me that subconsciously we tend to accept comments from people who have made a difference in our lives.
Suddenly I realised I have given powers to those who don’t even know about me. Unnecessarily, I made my life miserable when I was dependent on others to know about myself. Just because the people are older or more experienced doesn’t mean they know you thoroughly.
What a wonderful reunion of my true divine virtue with myself as a soul. It was celebration time when I met it on the last day of 2019. Yahoo! Isn’t it a wow moment when we become aware of our specialities for which no certificate is required from others?  A better understanding, better light and a better spiritual awakening! Isn’t our soul cherishing this reunion more than a reunion, say of a school or college?
Outside, either we bid farewell or add someone in our materialistic journey of life. But spiritually are we bidding farewell to greed and jealousy or imbibing divine virtues of contentment and selflessness from others?
Like the Pandavas, who were determined in fulfilling their oaths, I took a vow to apply a filter in my mind about what to accept from others in 2020. Instead I will check and recheck to find out if it’s really related to my transformation for the best or reject it immediately.
Like a devotee who by intense worship surrenders to God and gets a blessing in return, I surrender my intellect and mind to Lord Shiva to decide and enlighten me with His nectar of true knowledge.

282,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-start-admission/,"It is frustrating to see a large number of students returning from abroad unable to pass the Nepal Medical Council exams
The wrangling between the government and promoters of private medical colleges over the excessive fees charged by the latter has cost both of them very dear, what with Nepali students joining foreign medical colleges by the drove. This has happened largely because of the delay in admission to the bachelor level courses in medicine and dentistry this year, which should have been completed by October. Had the admissions taken place as in the previous years, students would have been weeks into the course. This year more than 700 students have gone abroad for the MBBS and BDS courses, and many more could be joining them in countries like China, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Philippines, among others. Given the expenses involved in studying medicine, it is a colossal drain on the country’s foreign exchange earnings. According to the Nepal Medical Council, 478 students had gone abroad to study medicine in 2016 and a similar number in the following years. There are about 20 medical colleges, affiliated mostly to Tribhuvan University and Kathmandu University. Most of them are run by the private sector.
While the growth of medical colleges should have been a cause for celebration, as Nepal is no longer dependent on foreign countries to train its doctors and nurses, the growing commercialisation of medical education has been unnerving for both the parents and the government. In their wild pursuit of making a quick buck by targeting solely those who can pay, quality in education has been largely compromised. So the government last year capped the fees for the MBBS undergraduate course at Rs 3.85 million in the Kathmandu Valley and Rs 4.24 million outside. For this fiscal, the fee for the MBBS course has been revised to Rs 4.02 million for Nepali students in Kathmandu’s medical colleges and to Rs 4.44 million for colleges outside the capital. The medical colleges have, however, been objecting to this provision and demanding they be allowed to charge more and also admit more students in both medicine and dental faculties. The private colleges have refused to reimburse the extra fees already charged from students, despite their pledge to do so.
It is an irony that students should have to opt for foreign medical colleges when there are institutes galore in the country. Their education is going to cost a fortune, but there is no guarantee that they will return home with the knowledge and skills required to treat the sick. It is frustrating to see a large number of students returning from abroad unable to pass the Nepal Medical Council exams required to practise medicine in the country. The medical colleges must abide by the Medical Education Act and the decision of the Cabinet last year regarding the fees and scholarships. By delaying the admissions for this year, maybe the colleges are thinking they are piling pressure on the government, with the belief that it will blink first. The government must, however, not yield to undue pressure. Hopefully, the colleges will see reason and start admission at the earliest. Any delay in admission will only hinder the timely completion of the undergraduate courses, which take five-and-a-half years to finish.

VNY 2020 begins
The much touted Visit Nepal Year (VNY) 2020 has begun from today, and various events related to it will be held throughout the year. The VNY secretariat said all preparations for the gala have been completed. President Bidhya Devi Bhandari is all set to inaugurate the VNY2020 today at the newly-renovated Dashrath Stadium to be attended by the who’s who. VNY 2020 will also be officially launched in all the seven provinces simultaneously.
The main objective of the event is to make the world known that Nepal is one of the most popular tourist destinations and also to inform that Nepal is a suitable country for foreign direct investment. The government has set a target of attracting two million foreign tourists in the year 2020, which will also help achieve the goal of building a “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”. It has also set a target of declaring the coming decade as tourism decade within six months to give a boost to the economy. However, merely making slogans is not enough. We also need to upgrade our infrastructure and complete our tourism-related projects such as the Gautam Buddha Airport on time so that more and more tourists can arrive via air without much hassle. Our goal should be to make our guests happy with the best of services.

283,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/time-for-a-currency-symbol-matter-of-national-identity/,"An interesting fact: Seventeen out of the 20 most traded currencies in the world have a strike in their symbol, the remaining three do not have a proper symbol. Even Bitcoin has two partial strikes
When it is a question of money, everyone is of the same religion – these beautiful nuggets of wisdom by Voltaire unveil the strength of money above everything. Most of the monies are represented through recognisable signs throughout the world, which are called currency symbols. A currency symbol is a graphic symbol used as shorthand for a currency’s name, especially in reference to amounts of money. We all know what they mean, and have some idea of the value of what they represent. But how did these famous currency symbols get their shapes, and why is it important to symbolise them?
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Older currency symbols have evolved slowly, often from previous currencies. The dollar and peso symbols originated from the mark employed to denote the Spanish real de a ocho, whereas the pound and lira symbols evolved from an L standing for libra, a Roman pound of silver. Newly invented currencies and currencies adopting new symbols have symbolism closer to their adopter. The added centre bar in the real sign is meant to symbolise stability. The new Indian rupee sign is a stylised combination of Latin and Devanagari letters.
Perhaps the most recognisable money symbol in the world, the dollar, has a pretty great story. The dollar can be traced back to Spain in the late 18th century. ‘Ps’ was the abbreviation used to represent the Spanish peso. A popular theory is that the S came to be written over the top of the P, creating what we now recognise as the dollar sign $. The pound symbol £, which most often signifies the British pound sterling, comes directly from a capital L for Libra. Libra in Latin means scales or balances, and was a basic unit of weight in the Roman Empire.
The Euro, €, is a baby, as far as historical currencies and their symbols are concerned. The Euro was launched on January 1, 1999, and the full currency takeover took place in 2002, with 14 billion banknotes and 52 billion coins produced and distributed all over the world. The Euro symbol was inspired by the Greek letter epsilon (ϵ), a reference to the cradle of European civilisation. It also stands for the first letter of the word ‘Europe’ in the Latin alphabet, while the two parallel lines running through the symbol signify stability.
In 2009, the Indian government aimed to raise the status of its currency, the rupee, by assigning it a currency symbol. The symbol represents the historical and cultural ethos of the country. The design is based on the Indian tricolor.
When writing currency amounts, the location of the symbol varies by currency. Many currencies in the English-speaking world and Latin America place it before the amount. In many European countries such as France, Germany, Greece, and the Scandinavian countries, the symbol is usually placed after the amount. However, placing the currency symbol before the amount is widely practiced.
Needless to say, money is power and power is important. Important things need an easy and universal way of communication to reach us all, especially to those whose lives depend on the €, the ¥ and the $. Every nation has a symbol of its own. A fine example is a country’s flag. Almost every religion, culture, deity, language or group of people has a symbol or two or even more. We just are not familiar with all of them because they either don’t come into play in our lives.
There is a reason why some countries in Europe and nations like USA, Canada and China have currency symbols, and some other countries don’t. The countries mentioned above are powerful and are key players in the world’s economic forum. These countries are the major players in international trade and have an important say in regional/global economic systems.
An interesting fact: Seventeen out of the 20 most traded currencies in the world have a strike in their symbol, the remaining three do not have a proper symbol. Even Bitcoin has two partial strikes in their symbol.
The Nepali currency is a matter of our pride and national identity. The rupee has a currency code, NPR, but it does not have a currency symbol. Since Nepal now has political stability, it’s gradually marching towards economic development. As the Nepali economy grows, the Nepali rupee is expected to be more stable and stronger. The time is ripe to assign a separate identity to its symbol as a step ahead towards an economic revolution.
Nepal is ranked 109th out of 140 countries, according to the 2018 edition of the Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum. Competitiveness rank of Nepal averaged 115.42 from 2007 until 2018, reaching an all-time high of 130 in 2011 and a record low of 100 in 2016.
Introducing a new symbol into computers is a challenging task. This is because there has to be a world-wide agreement about how to display that new symbol.  Adding new symbols to computerised character systems is a long, labourious process. The new symbol has to go through an approval process at several technical conferences and has to be decided if there is room on a given language code set to add the new symbol. The new standard has to be approved by the technical working groups, and then the fonts updated to display the symbol correctly.
Despite all the inevitable hassles, it’s the right time to think about introducing our own currency symbol for the Nepali rupee.

284,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/the-fight-for-attention/,"We all fight for attention, but rarely do we get any. Our innate desire to show people that we are of value reigns supreme, but, frankly speaking, we are all a bunch of attention-seekers.
The entire concept of social media is based on attention seeking. It’s mind boggling how instagram and facebook have changed the way we live. People are seen wearing certain garments, eating certain foods, listening to that trending music just to get some attention. But if everyone is seeking, then, who is giving? Who has the time to give attention to someone else?
From the evolutionary perspective, our tribal nature, meaning our innate sense to belong to a society and be treated as someone special might be the cause behind our excessive attention-seeking habits. If you are someone of value, then it’s a no brainer that you are asked for advice when a problem arises and given the respect you deserve. Women want to mate with you, and the probability of your survival increases. A pretty plausible reason to seek attention, eh?
However, our societies have evolved much more rapidly than our minds and bodies. Our instincts, such as fear that provided us with survival benefits, are more often than not the reason for our depression and anxiety. And the fact that we seek attention where we should not makes us highly self-conscious, which dampens our creativity.
Being self-conscious all the time makes us change the way we walk, the way we talk and the way we eat. This is not bad per se, but sometimes this works counter-intuitively. At times all of us have found ourselves panicking about how we look and how we are being perceived by other people. This excessive self-consciousness leads to a constant state of fear, and we cease to behave like ourselves, making us pretentious jerks.  These were pretty obvious reasons for relinquishing our attention-seeking habits. However, the fact that our attention is being gathered and sold by social media companies is outlandish and pushes us to add more sentences to our ‘reasons not to seek attention’ list.
Rather than seeking attention, we should pay attention. Being fully attentive to the task at hand is most probably everyone’s best bet at being happy. As Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi writes in his book “Flow: the psychology of optimal experience”, ‘we shape our life by deciding to pay attention to it. It is the direction of our attention and our intensity that determines what we accomplish and how well.’

285,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-draconian-bill/,"The parliamentary panel should have held wider consultations with the stakeholders before endorsing it with majority vote
Democracy will die in the absence of freedom of expression or opinion. This notion holds true in an emerging democracy like Nepal, where the people had to sacrifice their lives for decades for democracy and freedom of speech. Considering the importance of freedom of speech, the 1990 Constitution had also guaranteed the freedom of speech by clearly saying no press shall be seized simply for publishing any material or nobody shall be prosecuted for raising voices against the government or authorities. The same provision has also been incorporated in the new constitution, guaranteeing the right to speech, either through print or electronic media, which has gained momentum, thanks to rapid growth of information technology. Numerous online outlets are operating across the country, enjoying the freedom of speech fully guaranteed by the constitution. Although some of the contents in some media outlets are not up to the minimum standard and do not follow media ethics while criticising the powers that be, their right to expression cannot be curtailed in the guise of disciplining them. Let the public decide whether the contents carried by various media outlets are worth believing. The public will disown them outright if they are not trustworthy.
However, instead of putting trust in the public, the government is hell bent on controlling the free flow of information the people rightly deserve. The parliamentary Development and Technology Committee on Sunday endorsed the Information Technology Bill with majority vote despite strong reservation by the main opposition, the Nepali Congress. If the bill is passed as it is by the full House of the Federal Parliament, it will work like the Sword of Damocles hanging over everybody’s head opposed to the people in power. The bill has proposed severe penalty for offence against the state, computer hacking and cyber bullying. The bill has a provision of a fine not exceeding Rs 1.5 million or a jail term not exceeding five years, or both, for posting content on social networking sites that pose a threat to the country’s sovereignty, security, unity or harmony. The panel has also proposed imposing a fine of up to Rs 50,000 or six-month jail term, or both, on those found guilty of cyber bullying.
The panel has brought about some changes in the original bill on cyber bullying though it is also very harsh. The original bill, tabled by the government, had proposed punishing a person found guilty of cyber bullying with a fine not exceeding Rs 1 million or a jail term not exceeding five years, or both. But it increased the jail term from one year to three years for those found guilty of deleting or interfering with information stored in somebody’s computer. But the bill has failed to define what constitutes ‘cyber bullying’ and ‘offence against the state’. These vague terms can be grossly misused or misinterpreted by the authorities concerned. The lawmakers from the ruling parties should have held wider consultations with the stakeholders and the public before endorsing it, whose sole objective seems to be to control the social networking sites that are highly critical of the establishment. No bill should be passed in haste that may call for regret in leisure.

Pay the farmers
Will the government give a hearing to the plight of the cane farmers who have not been paid by the sugar mills? Since their protests in the provinces for months have fallen on deaf ears, they are now in the capital, hoping the government will listen to them and swing into action. The crushing season is about to start, but the farmers have not been paid for last year’s produce, some not even for the past few years. The different sugar mills owe the farmers a whopping Rs 1.5 billion in unsettled payments. The farmers have taken to cane farming by taking loans from the banks, and inability to get payments in time pushes them into a cycle of debt.
How can industry flourish in the country when producers of raw materials, namely farm produce, are given short shrift by the entrepreneurs and the government alike? Unlike the entrepreneurs, the farmers are not in a position to hobnob with those who enjoy power. Should the cane farmers decide to opt for a more lucrative crop, it could prove costly for the government as Nepal already imports billions of rupees worth of sugar annually. Perhaps, it is time the government rapped the mill owners before things get out of hand.

A few months back, the court in India had issued a similar order to halt the massacre of trees in Mumbai around Arey housing colony, which was being cleared for the parking of Mumbai Metro. This incident also reminds one of the Chipko Movement, launched by Sundar Lal Bahuguna in the Seventies in India by clinging to the trees.

The history of aircraft and airports goes back a long time. It is said that Kubera, the business tycoon, had a plane called Puspak, which was a kind of a pilotless aircraft, and it used to take direction as per the imagination of the passenger.
Rama is said to have come back to Ayodhya after victory over Ravana in glittery Lanka on this plane after Bibhishan, the newly-crowned king, presented it to Rama. Ravana, nasty as he was, is said to have snatched this plane from Kubera.
The east may have exotic stories of a mythical past, but modern aviation activity started from the west in Carolina, the United States, when the Wright brothers invented the aeroplane in the year 1903.
Interestingly, Rana prince and scientist Gehendra Shumsher had also made a model of a plane, machine gun, steam-run motor and cannon with the help of Tirtha Prasad and Muse Thapa during this time in Nepal.
But then Prime Minister Chandra Shumsher hatched a sinister conspiracy by serving slow poison to Gehendra Shumsher, banishing Tirtha Prasad from the country and putting Muse Thapa behind bars for seven years.
It was a huge setback for science, technology and innovation in the country, from which it has yet not been able to rise.
The planes and airports have changed beyond imagination to such an extent that it is difficult to believe they could take their present form, marked by grandioseness and gigantism. What started as a simple two-person carrier passenger plane, invented in 1914, has now transformed into a dizzy Boeing 777X Jet that can carry 384 passengers at a time.
Similarly, airports have been through six generations, beginning with a landing strip with passenger facilities provided in huts. Some of them can still be seen in Nepal, like the one in Jumla.
The sixth one is the big hangar terminal building type, such as the breathtaking international airport in Beijing, which was opened last September-end. It has been constructed to handle 72 million passengers per year by 2025, which will be almost three times the population of Nepal. Designed by the legendary lady architect, the late Zaha Hadid, it cost an astronomical $12 billion, which is about 40 per cent of Nepal’s GDP.
In Nepal, the national flag carrier, Royal Nepal Airlines, was established in 1957. The earliest airport was what is now known as Sanu Gaucharan, which is located near Gyaneswore in Kathmandu, before it moved to the present Tribhuvan International Airport. The Indian ambassador first landed in a Beechcraft Bonanza at this airport. Nepal has now about 50 airports, small and medium, dotted across the country. Nijgadh International Airport was mooted a long time back, but it is seeking to go the Melamchi way in view of the long time that it has taken for its take off.
Airports have been facing opposition during their construction in the past as well as in the present. A similar protest was launched back in the Seventies in Japan against the construction of Narita airport. The demonstrations turned violent, claiming the lives of three riot police. One young protester hanged himself. But the government accomplished the construction of the airport despite heavy demonstrations going side by side. More recently, a protest erupted in South Korea in connection with the construction of the airport on Jeju island.
The government had declared that the project was feasible, but the local community pointed at certain flaws in the project, which the Government had to ultimately accept. The government is now working with the community hand in glove and making all the activities transparent during its construction.
Experience thus shows that there are two ways to go ahead in the face of opposition in connection with the implementation of projects.
Either the government should have the teeth strong enough to calm down the opposition as in the case of Narita or take the local population into confidence and complete the construction. The first one does not seem to be possible in the present context of Nepal.
The government should win the hearts and minds of the community people by working in a spirit of bonhomie as well as brotherhood and move together to make it a reality.

287,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/colombo-plan-for-education-and-class/,"During our student days, the Colombo Plan was the financial passport to higher studies. The Colombo Plan provided an escape from poverty for many. Those days there was no viable alternative to a good education for a career.
So many poor students pinned their hope on it, but few succeeded as you required excellent results in SLC as well as Intermediate. In hindsight, the plan was discriminatory as it gave preference to comparatively prosperous but less meritorious students from outside the Kathmandu Valley.
So, it was no surprise that an affluent college mate, a Sherpa, from Khumbu received a scholarship under the Colombo Plan to study MBBS. He was also smart as he hummed Cliff Richard’s ‘Lemon Tree’ all the time. To our surprise, he spoke English a lot. He had studied and completed his A-Level from a school run by Sir Edmund Hillary for the Sherpa children.
Years later, he recounted the downside of the Colombo Plan that had turned him into a gynaecologist against his will. He was too embarrassed to introduce himself as a doctor as, he added with great humour, the ladies in labour would faint at the sight of him. So he opted to man the emergency of a national hospital in Kathmandu. His line of speciality had no use in the ‘backward’ society then.
Earlier, another classmate, in SLC, pinned his hope on the Colombo plan to become a doctor. After the result, he despaired as he barely squeezed through the iron gate.
Many years later, I ran into him under the pipal tree at New Road. He looked prosperous and spoke with a crassness, almost crude, that people acquired after stumbling upon riches accidentally. In less than 15 minutes he recounted his success story, thanking providence for giving him third division in SLC.
He went to Pulchowk campus to train as an overseer on a monthly stipend. After completion, the government hired
him to work in a section of the East-West Highway project. It turned his life around as he received a windfall.
When we met years later, he told me he could no longer keep count of his staff and vehicles. At that time, he looked more like a dalal bereft of a class than a classy businessman. I remembered the days when he would evade his landlady for days, unable to pay the Rs 5 rent in arrears. I remember my parents telling me money cannot buy class. That is why proper education is so important. The Colombo Plan offered both.

288,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-animal-care/,"The health of animals should also be of concern to everyone, as there is an interdependent relationship with that of humans
The quality and quantity of animal products, such as eggs, meat and milk, can be guaranteed only when the source, or animal, is healthy and has been taken well care of right from birth. Towards that end, the government has just registered the Animal Health and Livestock Services Council-Bill 2019 at the Secretariat of the Federal Parliament with the intent to streamline the business related to animal health and animal husbandry. The health of animals, just like that of humans, should be of concern to everyone, as there is an interdependent relationship between the two. It is believed that about 60 per cent of all diseases of humans originate in animals. Diseases like bird and swine flu and Ebola, to name a few, have their origin in animals and birds, and they have proved devastating not only for animals and humans but also to the economy of the countries concerned. In ensuring animal health, dedicated and qualified animal health workers and livestock service entrepreneurs have a big role to play.
Apart from developing and promoting animal health and livestock business in the country, the bill also proposes the establishment of a powerful 23-member council to formulate necessary policies, plans and programmes to modernise the livestock service business. Among others, it shall provide suggestions to ensure quality of animal products, animal reproduction and animal husbandry, and determine the qualification of animal health and livestock service entrepreneurs. The bill bars an individual from running such a business without first being registered with the council, although entrepreneurs already registered with the Nepal Veterinary Council are exempted from this provision. So once the bill is endorsed by the parliament and comes into force, it will curtail the haphazard growth of livestock service providers, who not only pose a threat to the health of the animals but also to the growth of the meat and dairy industry.
As the population grows, there is a need to produce more milk, meat and eggs in the country. Securing an uninterrupted supply of nutritious food largely depends on healthy and productive animals and birds. Today livestock production can be ensured with improved breeding, vaccinations and quality animal feed. A healthy and sturdy livestock, free from diseases, is the mainstay of an agrarian economy like ours. A single animal provides a farmer not only milk and meat, but also manure for the farm. The loss of animals – and birds – has telling impact on the financial condition of the farmer, as has been the case when chickens and pigs had to be culled as a necessity during outbreaks of bird and swine flu. But the mere availability of quality treatment and food will not improve the condition of animals if we continue to see them as beasts deserving no better. The Supreme Court’s verdict that prohibits cruelty to animals, namely buffaloes, during transportation over long distances must be enforced. Similarly, people have only heard but not seen the extreme cruelty and brutality used during the slaughter of big animals that take place in unhygienic conditions. When these are also taken care of, we can then look forward to healthy and tasty meat in the market.

Beggar-free city
Making a big city like Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) free from beggars is not an easy task. It needs a coordinated approach of different elected and government bodies to make a city beggar-free. Hundreds of children, elderly people, disabled ones and orphans, some of them even from outside the country, throng the city to eke out a living by begging in the streets and temples. Assimilating them with their families back home should be the ultimate goal of the authorities concerned.
The KMC has so far rescued more than 365 people with a view to making it a beggar-free zone. Among those rescued, 215 were assimilated with their families while others were taken care of by Manab Sewa Ashram, which provides shelter to homeless people. The KMC has launched a three-month campaign to free it of beggars, which coincides with the Visit Nepal Year 2020. Studies show majority of the rescued elderly people have families back home but they refuse to stay with them. We must find out why they chose to stay away from their families. Love, care and compassion are the three things that make people want to live with their family members. Taking care of the elderly people should be the duty of all.

289,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/no-mercy-to-the-roads-so-lets-define-carrying-capacity/,"To keep the road infrastructure in condition, every single road needs to be defined with its carrying capacity. It could then decide on the number, types and time for vehicles to run over them
Roads! Quite helpless in Kathmandu as I can see. Only because they are not living. Had they been living, they would have felt the agony of how brutally they are being used. If any mishap occurs, the first blame goes to the roads. As a road user, whether a pedestrian, biker or driver, you definitely tend to curse the road first if anything went wrong with you. We seldom feel how the roads have come along till now.
In Nepal, roads are always in a pitiful condition throughout the year. Everyday you’ll see hundreds of thousands of vehicles rolling over them hastily.
Along with the utility prospect of the roads, their condition has also been overlooked. That’s why the roads are full of dust during the dry season and muddy when wet.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Sometimes, you even see animals lying in the midst of the bare roads with no traffic signage. At the end of the day, you hear a number of accidents happening on these roads, which definitely is not soothing to our ears. So, it’s high time to think whether these accidents are occurring because of the roads or because of the way we are using them.
According to American urban planner Kevin Lynch, pathways are one of the five key elements portraying the image of a city. Paths generally can be denoted by railways, highways, roads, streets, tracks and lanes. It’s not only the beauty and services that portray the image of a city but also the users who add value to it.
Roads thus add substantially to city morphology and urban environment. For a commoner, good roads are a parameter of the development index, too. But functionally, they guide people in making travel for various purposes. So, they are a means of numerous activities of public domain, and hence their conditions undoubtedly impact urban life. The utilitarian prospect and condition prospect of our roads raise many queries.
The commonly seen roads lack drainage, footpaths, greenery, lighting and street furniture. So there is a high risk of potential conflict between vehicles and pedestrians. Blacktopping only the road middle is the mindset of the authority during construction, not the edges and other accessories of the road. We have still not been able to think of other public amenities to bring comfort for the ordinary citizens using roads.
Ironically, “Ashare Bikas” is the term we have been hearing every time near the end of the fiscal year, when we witness road construction happening hastily simply to finish the allocated budget.
This also applies to other infrastructures like sanitation, water supply, electricity and telecom that end up digging up the roads and leaving them as they are.
An integrated and coordinated way to involve all these line agencies and respective departments at the time of construction has never happened in Nepal.
Furthermore after the declaration of the federal state, roads are being built in rampant rapidity across the country with the ambitious vision to provide connectivity and basic infrastructure.
But the roads have remained incomplete everywhere and proved a bane to the natural environment. Agricultural lands, beautiful hills and forests have been penetrated, leading to consecutive landslides in the monsoon.
If we look keenly at the traffic clots in the Kathmandu Valley, they indicate the abuse of traffic rules and the insanity people show on the roads. Hundreds of vehicles occupy the entire road in a bid to get out of the traffic junction when the signal is given. Had they queued into a single lane, they would have easily crossed over. Do we really need traffic personnel at every corner of a street? Do we really take care of signs on the roads? Why are people in haste on the streets?
Of course, our traffic infrastructure systems do fail frequently, which is one of the reasons for not being able to tame the people. The traffic lights do not work and the traffic signs have faded away. Who is to blame – the people or the authority? To keep the road infrastructure in place and in condition, every single road needs to be defined with its carrying capacity. It could then decide on the number, types and time for vehicles to run over them. Otherwise, the notion of roads would be the same for bicycles, heavy loaders, two wheelers, four wheelers and pedestrians.
Similarly, pedestrians, public transportation, government official vehicles, goods carriers and private vehicles should be included hierarchically into a priority list on every street. Generally, pedestrians and cyclists should get priority, with private vehicles getting the least.
This would enable the authority to maintain the road infrastructure properly and introduce road permits and taxation systems accordingly.
Look at the way roads are being maintained in Nepal, you will never convince yourself that they are good enough to move on. The streets are swept, but the dust is heaped on the road side and never collected. Craters get filled with rubble, but never get compressed and layered with asbestos.
Vehicles coming especially from the rural areas carry mud along with them and deposit them onto the roads. Some time back, all three municipalities of the Kathmandu valley had demanded broomers to sweep their respective roads. But now, they are lying idle due to technical flaws and difficulty in operation.

290,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/equip-government-premises/,"The delay in service delivery in government offices is frustrating and not unusual. However, my recent experience at a government office caught me off guard. I visited the General Post Office (GPO) situated at Dillibazar to enquire about the delivery of my post.
Upon reaching there, the reference number was tracked, and I was asked to meet the assigned delivery man for details. The respective delivery man was unavailable, so, upon request, despite being tied up, another employee helped me out in checking the delivery detail from the logbook. To obtain a copy of the delivery detail, I needed to use email and also get documents printed and Xerox-ed. The availability of these facilities inside the GPO premises facilitated my work. Most importantly, the concerned department head was supportive in ensuring quick service delivery. My work was completed within a few minutes which otherwise would have taken a couple of hours or maybe another day.
Generally, in most government offices, the unavailability of certain staff leads to ‘come later’, ‘long hours of waiting’ or ‘come another day’. Not having certain information would require you to travel back and forth; and to get a print or copy of a document, one has to leave the premises to search the facility nearby. Service seekers most often face delays in government offices for various reasons. Undoubtedly, the most common reason is the lack of office equipment within the premises. Most government offices rely on outside shops for photocopy and printing services. In addition to it, the unavailability and unwillingness of the government employee to go for these services only hinders timely service delivery.
For most government offices, photocopy and printing is done outside the premises. It not only causes slowdown of service delivery but also promotes bribery. The document is taken outside the premises by the government employee, who often demands a fee from service seekers.
The availability of necessary equipment and the willingness of the government employees have a lot to do with effective and quality service delivery. The government should plan action to equip the premises of government offices and make these basic facilities convenient for service seekers. This would not only increase swiftness and simplify service delivery but also ensure the safety of documents and help in curbing bribery in government offices.

291,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-threat-of-pneumonia/,"Taking preventive measures is the best way to keep children below 15 years of age free from influenza and pneumonia 
Doctors have advised parents to take care of their children, especially those below 15 years of age, during the winter season as it provides the most favourable condition for the speedy growth of virus/ bacteria that may lead to viral influenza and pneumonia. With the mercury dropping every day, chances of catching viral influenza and pneumonia are very high because of a higher level of moisture in the air during the winter. The cold wave in the Tarai and chilly environment in the hilly and mountainous regions in the morning and evening have led to higher cases of viral influenza and pneumonia, especially among the children and elderly people. The cold wave in the southern plains has thrown normal life out of gear, forcing the people to stay put inside their homes and burning firewood to ward off the bone-chilling cold. The yearly phenomenon will continue to remain unchanged for a couple of weeks to come. The Kathmandu Valley is more prone to pneumonia because of air pollution caused by dust and smoke belched out by vehicles and brick kilns. The dust and smoke hang over just above the ground in the morning, making it most risky to venture out at that time. Recurrence of pneumonia among the children between two months and 15 years of age with a history of two or more episodes of pneumonia is very high.
In a study conducted by Dr Prashant Rijal and his team at the Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital on 653 patients of the hospital from July 2013 to June 2018, 74 of them were diagnosed with recurrent pneumonia. It means, on an average, one in nine children with pneumonia has recurrent pneumonia. Air pollution, overcrowding, malnutrition, congenital anomalies, congenital immune deficiency, gastroesophageal reflux, lack of vaccine and babies who are not breastfed are some of the reasons for the recurrence of pneumonia among the children. Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection caused either by virus, bacteria or fungi that affects the lungs. After suffering from pneumonia, air sacs in the lungs are filled with fluid, making it difficult to breath.
Doctors have advised all to take preventive measures to keep their children free from the cold-related disease. Breastfeeding, proper vaccination, keeping children away from the cold, pollution and timely treatment are the best preventive measures. As the disease spreads via air-borne droplets from cough and sneezing, children are more prone to contact the infection at school. Early recognition of pneumonia and management of its causes are the best way to reduce the mortality rate related to pneumonia. According to a World Life Expectancy survey, influenza and pneumonia deaths in Nepal reached 10,535, or 6.45 per cent of the total deaths in 2017. Influenza and pneumonia claimed the lives of 47 persons out of every 100,000 people in 2017. According to WHO, pneumonia accounted for 15 per cent of all deaths of children under five years in 2017. Early diagnosis and care are necessary for children suffering from pneumonia. Immediate medical help is needed if a child suffers from fever, cough and common cold, has difficulty in breathing and has developed a sore throat. Prevention is always better than cure.

Bizarre story
In what is a bizarre incident, seven persons have been arrested for abducting a Nepali model and trying to sell her to a religious cult in India for a sacrifice. The model must thank her stars and the Nepal Police that intervened just in time to save her life. Nepali women and girls have been trafficked to India and beyond mostly to be sold into the flesh trade, but the latest incident involving a model for a human sacrifice reads like a plot out of Indian cinema. The police are investigating the case, and should it turn out that the model was being trafficked for a religious sacrifice, then it should make everyone sit up and contemplate the gravity of the issue.
Nepal and India share an open border, and thousands of people from either side cross the largely unregulated border every day. This makes it easy for unscrupulous people to traffic unsuspecting Nepali women and children across the border for different purposes. If religious cults are indeed looking for humans to make sacrifices, then children who disappear without a trace should be a matter of worry to the parents. This calls for stronger vigilance by the community, parents and the police to keep our society safe.

In 2019, an estimated 1.26 million people were exposed to flood risks during the monsoon season. While there had been many devastating floods in the recent years, —from the 2008 Koshi River flooding to this year’s monsoon flooding in which 200,000 people were affected — the phenomenon has always been a fairly cyclical, consistent occurrence.
The consequences of flooding are as varied as they are serious: families lose homes, crops and livestock. Road blockages prevent markets from functioning properly, and building damage compromises safe, productive activity. Those most affected are invariably the most vulnerable or socially marginalised groups, and food stock loss, hygiene and sanitation problems combine to exacerbate existing food insecurity issues.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
The government has been working on flooding preparedness and early warning to mitigate the impact of floods on communities. One example of this is the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology’s early warning messages, which are sent out in the hours preceding rapid flooding, allowing families enough time to react. Another innovative idea that has emerged in recent years is Forecast-based Financing (FbF).
FbF is an innovative mechanism whereby early actions at the community and government level are pre-planned based on credible forecasts, and are funded and implemented before a climate shock. Its goal is to anticipate disasters, prevent or mitigate their impact, if possible, and reduce human suffering and losses.
FbF at its core turns traditional humanitarian response on its head—instead of focussing on assistance after a flood, support is given to communities ex-ante. Reliable triggers for assistance are set based on risk analyses and weather forecasts, and anticipatory actions — from evacuation to prepositioning of food and relief items – are taken in the days and hours before the disaster hits.
Championed by the likes of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the German Red Cross and the World Food Programme (WFP), FbF came into widespread practice only in the last few years. It has been applied in humanitarian response ranging from floods in Bangladesh, to hurricanes in the Caribbean, to drought in Niger.
This concept, applied to floods, has been firmly backed by the Nepal government, and reflected in its National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy of 2018. Through this initiative, tools to monitor and forecast a variety of hazards are to be linked with early warning systems and early government actions.
As an implementing agency of FbF, WFP has been supporting the government in improving the quality of forecasts to better predict floods and their impacts through the creation of new hydrodynamic models. The next step is to understand household vulnerability, and to this end, WFP and the Nepal Red Cross Society have been collecting household data in 11 Tarai districts and ranked them on a risk index. This allows Palika governments to direct their efforts towards the households and communities that need assistance the most.
Equally important to the FbF approach is outlining the anticipatory actions that governments and partners can take against reliable forecasts. WFP has worked with 19 Tarai district governments to design standard operating procedures that spell out various anticipatory actions to take at different lead times, including evacuation of at-risk populations, activation of early emergency protocols, and preparation of assistance for at-risk or affected communities.
Other actors, including the Nepal Red Cross Society, the Danish Red Cross and Practical Action, are also starting to incorporate a forecast-based, anticipation-based approach to disasters.
An international dialogue platform in Berlin, and three additional regional Dialogue Platforms held in Africa, Asia and Latin America with partners creates every year an exchange between participants on ways to improve Forecast-based Financing, and best implement the concept into existing
projects and advance the use of weather and climate data.
FbF is gaining increased attention in Nepal. On November 28, the Ministry of Home Affairs hosted the first-ever National Dialogue Platform for Forecast-based Financing and Anticipatory Humanitarian Action in Kathmandu. The National Dialogue Platform, which comes on the heels of a similar global event held two weeks prior, brought together government at all levels, practitioners and donors and served as a space to exchange ideas and practices.
As a result of the Platform, a clear community of practice is being formed among key government, NGO, UN and civil society partners based on a common vision on how anticipatory actions can best support the people of Nepal in becoming more risk-informed and shock-resilient.
As climate change drives more extreme weather events eveywhere, countries like Nepal are broadening the humanitarian toolbox to ensure that the right support gets to those most in need, at the right time. Forecast-based financing is an exciting step in this direction.

293,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/mind-it-to-mend-it/,"The thrusting action behind every action is a persuasive longing to doing better. This uplifting idea works on that vibrant, enriching loop called conscious principle. The result — a vigorous urge to become unequivocally useful to oneself and also others.
There are decent folks around us, yet — some of them with abundant individual, or bespoke, aptitudes and qualities. It is their profuse strength of mind and mindfulness that places them at the ‘controls.’ They achieve because they envision and decrypt what they distinguish into action. When you are in their circle, or company, you are also elevated to a higher stratum of conscious attentiveness.
This whole progression plays a fundamental role in the preservation of our health and well-being primarily because any change in our consciousness brings with it somatic, emotional and mental implications. From worthy attitude, positivity, harmony, self-confidence, success and fulfilment to distraction, skewed thinking, anxiety and tummy distress, aside from disorders like hypertension. This prompts a surfeit of surging ancillary effects, too — good and bad. The resultant outcome of the latter is obvious — a disruption in our activity pattern, or movement of energy. When this process occurs on a protracted footing, it leads to not just compromised living, but also existence.
This is why the whole process of re-establishment of health and wellness, in prolonged illness, may often take a long time. The consequence is extended therapy, including its inevitable spin-offs — despair, vexation and ‘drug-centric’ side-effects. The best thing that any of us could do is making a constant and determined effort towards optimal health, while heeding to our body signals and improving the intensity of our conscious responsiveness.
In other words, we should learn to disengage ourselves from our constant contemplations and anxieties. But this isn’t easy. The best thing we’d all do is: use our intuitive, observant and intellectual mind with better judgment, foresight and insight. This will allow us to disentangle ourselves from our artificial attitudes or responses. It also helps us to realise ourselves as spiritual entities — not just corporeal, earthly objects with mind, body, spirit, or soul. The rest is predictable — when our sense of self-consciousness swells, it lifts us to a higher form of consciousness. Call it spiritual, or cosmic, mindfulness — or, what you may.

294,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-fruit-of-federalism/,"Local governments must improve their spending capacity and administrative skills so that all the local units can generate more resources for themselves
It’s taken quite some time, but the fruit of federalism is starting to trickle down to the local levels, namely the rural and urban municipalities. For the first time, the government has distributed royalty collected last fiscal from the use of four natural resources – mountains, rives, forests and mines – at the local level. Although the government should have disbursed the royalty a month after the end of the last fiscal, or mid-August, it was able to do so only last week because of the confusion over how to do it. The biggest beneficiary has been Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, home to the world’s tallest peak, Mt. Everest. It raked in Rs 115 million, which is understandable, given that the 8,848-m peak commands a royalty of $11,000 from each foreign climber. Other major recipients generated royalty mostly from the use of their rivers for the construction of hydropower projects. The government distributed Rs 1.4 billion in royalty to 576 of the 753 local units, or 76.5 per cent.
In line with the federal set up, the central government keeps half of the total royalty generated at the local level, while distributing 25 per cent to the seven provinces and the remaining 25 per cent to the local units. Thus the federal government retained Rs 2.9 billion in royalty collected from the use of natural resources. The way the local levels generate resources shows that not all are equally advantaged. Some local units have more natural resources than others, or even if one is naturally endowed, it might not be in a position to exploit them. So how will those local levels that received no royalty or received very little be compensated by the federal government? The disparity in royalty income could invite conflict among the local units and with the centre.
Of course, the local governments also enjoy four types of fiscal transfers. The equalisation grants are transfers of resources to the provincial and local governments based on population and development status. The conditional grants are funds meant for implementing projects related to national policies and standards. Matching grants are transfer of funds to complement the resources of the local level for a project while special grants support a special project related to the supply of services, emergency needs and activities of national priority. Add to these VAT and internal excise tax revenues as well as royalty that are shared among the federal, provincial and local governments. On top of these, the local governments will also collect local taxes on property and rent, and vehicle registration fees where feasible. So even without the royalty, the funds that are transferred to the local levels are quite substantial. The spending responsibilities now lie with the local governments, allowing them to plan the expenditure as per the needs of the locals. But they have shown limited implementation capacity to fully utilise their resources. Hence, the local governments will need to improve their spending capacity and administrative skills so that all the local units can generate more resources for themselves, including royalty, so as to lessen their dependence on the central government’s largesse.

A welcome move
In a major development, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) on Tuesday issued a three-point circular to all the District Administration Offices (DAOs) of Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces directing them to take strong legal action against those forcing or practising chhaupadi. The DAOs were told to form a mechanism to act tough against the worst form of gender-based violence. Chhaupadi, which is widely practised in the provinces, is a punishable crime.
The ministry’s circular is a welcome move, which will help eliminate the superstition and taboos associated with menstruation, which is a normal biological process that also helps purify women’s blood. The circular says those who practise and encourage chhaupadi will be deprived of social security allowances and facility of subsidised loans, while members of a family who banish girls and women during their period will be deprived of senior citizen allowance and other social security schemes. The MoHA has also told the DAOs to destroy the chhau sheds. If these measures are well implemented at the grass-roots level, the age-old practice in the provinces will come to an end. Though the Supreme Court ruled that chhaupadi was illegal in 2005, it is still widely prevalent there.

295,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/future-of-maize-introduce-hybrid-varieties/,"Since the area under maize cannot be expanded and developing new farm technologies can be expensive, productivity gaps across regions and among farmer groups can be narrowed more quickly using available technologies
When you buy popcorn in a movie theater, maize cobs from a street vendor and a meal which comes from processing maize as feed, we should be thankful to the farmers. They are men and women who battle against the unpredictable weather and invasive insects and bring food from the field to our fork. I have been hearing that agriculture is the government’s priority since I was a child. The 6th five-year plan (1980-1985) focussed on attaining food self-sufficiently in the hills, including maize, but still there is not much progress. Productivity of maize, the main cereal crop after rice and a promising cash crop, started increasing slowly and constantly after 1985. From 1.5 tons per hectare in 1985, productivity reached 1.6 tons in 1990/91 and 2.6 tons in 2018/19.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
A recently released statistical information by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MoALD) shows that maize is grown on 954,000 hectares (25% of the total area of cereals), which was 758,000 ha in 1985.
In three decades of efforts, productivity has increased by around 1% every year. However, the overall demand for maize is expected to grow by 4-6% every year for the next 20 years. The major hindrance to growing more is an inefficient production system.
Maize is being used for feed, food, fuel and fibre. The increasing demand for maize comes from the growing need for poultry feed. Some 80% of maize consumption in Nepal is due to poultry and animal feed. The domestic production can meet only 30% of current demand. India exported 5 million tons of feed and maize seeds to Nepal in 2018/19.
Nepali farmers face problems of quality seed and fertiliser availability and a market for their produce. Besides, the reason for an inefficient production system is inadequate scientific and technological knowledge among the maize farming communities. Majority of the farmers still sow the local varieties not by preference, but due to the unavailability of quality seeds and lack of technical knowledge of hybrid maize production.
Nepal has developed and released 29 open-pollinated (improved through selection and traditional plant breeding method) and five hybrids (developed through cross-pollination) maize varieties. To date, nearly all hybrid seeds are imported.
The bulk of maize grown areas (80.6%) lies in the hills and mountains, but their productivity is less than the national average.
So, is not the production and distribution of maize hybrid seeds by the National Maize Research Programme or extension mechanism of MoALD a failure? MoALD, Nepal Agriculture Research Council and PM’s Agricultural Modernisation Programme are the government’s three wings for maize development.
But they lack coordination among themselves. The government has a long history of top-down decision-making and very low participation of the local people in influencing policy decisions. It has instituted a wide range of policies and targets, where the recently announced target is to double agricultural production within the next five years (2018-2023). The question is, will it be achieved?
Not only doom and bloom but many interesting trends are emerging, and there are many opportunities lying to be tapped. For example, we could include winter maize under the rice-wheat system to reduce its import.
This requires less water compared to the usual rain-fed maize growing areas in summer. With the rise of the decentralised governance structure, each local government can have its agricultural policies based on local needs.
The government is promoting the collective farming model in agriculture through cooperatives, and farmers can take advantage of irrigation, agro-inputs, insurance, mechanisation and technological services. A few farmers from Chitwan and Kaski districts are already using this model.
Since the area under maize cannot be expanded and developing new farm technologies is expensive, productivity gaps across regions and among farmer groups can be narrowed more quickly using available technologies and extension services.
For this, dissemination of scientific research findings, including the best management practices in local languages, among farmers will be pivotal.
Farmers should also be encouraged to visit on-farm research trials on improved open-pollinated and hybrid varieties to motivate them to introduce similar practices in their fields. Research run by International Business Machines Corporation and Walmart on moving the process of food block chain from production to consumer level can be tracked in 2.2 seconds, which typically took seven days to trace the source of food in the past. We could develop similar technologies to track the supply chain of seed, fertiliser and maize products in the Nepali market and beyond.
Apps related to maize crop calendar, weather forecast, diagnosis of insect-pest, disease, nutrient deficiency from a photo (submitted by the farmer) can be developed. In fact, some of these apps are under testing and verification phases.
Approaches based on information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be harnessed as a cost-effective way to reach farmers and help in Nepal’s food security. And let’s bring in the youths as technological innovators and agri-preneurs in maize production.

I never knew those feelings existed in me, that my heart could race so fast while talking to you; that I could be worried by your worries and that I could plan special things for you.
I never knew I was capable of loving someone until I met you. I felt like I could conquer the world for you if only conquering the world would make you mine. From the moment you came into my life, I have given my heart and my soul to you.
I was scared to let you know my feelings at first. I used to keep those feelings to myself. I still remember those times when I would remember the things you said to me and laugh alone to myself; when though I would be in a room, my brain and my mind would be with you and the things you said.
It still happens to me sometimes when I get to see you and talk to you. After I meet you, I would always have your hangover for days, sometimes even weeks!
As I was scared to tell you my feelings lest you stop talking to me, I became your friend. I listened to all your worries, cared for you and loved you with all my heart.
You thought I was a good friend, but you never could see through me, see my heart longing for you.

I knew all the while that you never loved me, that for you I was always your best friend. You would remember me only when you felt lonely.
In the past, I used to be happy to just be there for you. I would express my love and not expect love in return. That was fine for a while, but it is not fine anymore. I am tired of being your friend, tired of being treated like one, too.
I am tired of seeing you giving attention to something else than me and tired of pretending that it is okay to ignore me. Call me selfish if you will, but I am tired of not getting the love that I deserve.
I am tired of listening to you whine about how cold it is now when I would be in T-shirts just so I could look nice to you. I am tired of hearing you complain about how lonely you feel sometimes when I am always there for you.
I want you to know that it is easier to gain than to lose. I am not afraid of losing you anymore. Yes, I don’t want to be your friend anymore.

297,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-cross-border-crimes/,"The arrest of 122 Chinese nationals in a single day proves that cross-border cyber and financial crimes are on the rise in recent times
In what appears to be one of the biggest raids, Nepal Police arrested as many as 122 Chinese nationals from various parts of the capital on Monday on suspicion of their involvement in illegal activities, cyber and financial crimes. Tipped off by the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu, they were rounded up from Manamaiju, Bansbari and Budhanilkantha areas between 1:00 pm and 7:00 pm. Police have also seized around 500 laptops and more than 150 mobile phones from their rented apartments. Police believe they were indulging in illegal activities, such as cyber and financial crimes. “Urgent arrest warrants” were issued by the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police in coordination with the Metropolitan Crime Division-Teku, Metropolitan Police Range-Ranipokhari and the police headquarters. Earlier, the Chinese Embassy had written a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the entry of those Chinese people from the Philippines, Cambodia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The Foreign Ministry had immediately forwarded the letter to the Home Ministry, which instructed the police headquarters to take action. They are learnt to have fled the said countries after the governments started cracking down on them for indulging in hacking the banking systems there and in China. Preliminary investigation shows that all of the arrested had entered Nepal on a tourist or student visa.
The Kathmandu District Court will now decide whether to free or detain them for a few more days. Such a large number of Chinese nationals have been detained in a single day four months after six Chinese nationals were arrested in connection with the country’s biggest cyber heist in the banking sector, from where they had stolen at least Rs 35.8 million from the ATMs in Nepal and India. The police are yet to establish whether the new arrests have any connection with the old ones. The way they had rented the apartments at very high prices and used special identity cards to enter there shows they had bigger plans to commit cyber, financial crimes and engage in other illegal activities.
In recent times, Nepal has become a lucrative place to engage in cyber and financial crimes for international racketeers, who are taking advantage of the country’s security lapses. Despite Nepal Rasta Bank’s repeated notifications to the banks and financial institutions to upgrade their security system, they have not adhered to the instructions. Strong vigilance, especially at major tourist hubs, is a must to control cyber crimes, smuggling and drug trafficking. The law enforcement agency must make sure that no foreigner on a tourist or a student visa is involved in non-tourist activities. Others who overstay their visa should be booked and legal action taken against them. We also need to further strengthen mutual cooperation with our friendly countries when it comes to dealing with criminal activities. Their arrest would not have been possible without cooperation from China. At a press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry official confirmed the arrest of the Chinese nationals in Nepal. The official also confirmed that the action was taken under mutual cooperation between the two countries.

Inhumane behaviour
There was a time when buffaloes were made to trek hundreds of miles from the Tarai plains to the Kathmandu Valley before being slaughtered for meat. They no longer walk, but the conditions under which they are transported in trucks from one place to another are simply harsh. The Supreme Court, following its verdict on February 11 on a writ petition demanding the government prohibit people from transporting domesticated animals and birds in an inhumane and cruel manner, had directed the government to enact the Animal Welfare Act. However, animals continue to be transported for more than eight hours without food in crammed trucks, with the government remaining a mute spectator.
It must be difficult for the government to implement the legal provision on animals, knowing fully well how even humans must fare in our overcrowded public vehicles. The inhumane way of transporting animals is only half the story, the savagery with which they are slaughtered deserves even greater attention. If we are to live in a civilised world, we must look after the welfare of not only humans but also that of animals. The sooner the government acts, the sooner it will help ease the pangs of the animals.

298,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/being-a-happy-homemaker-for-the-well-being-of-society/,"A greater theme of women empowerment is to give her the freedom to be productive inside and outside her home, not pressurising her to a point that she would suffer a burnout in her important roles
The role of women in society has been varying throughout the time frame. Earlier, women stood as respectable makers of the home – serving as a wife, mother and mother-in-law. They found their values and respect within their positions inside home. However, in recent times, an extra role of women as a working member of society has been added. In fact, women have reached high positions, which once were considered too far out for them. Women have been presidents and prime ministers of nations, respectable doctors, lawyers, professors, analysts and everything that used to be solely under male ordinance.
While it is impressive that women have been earning and bearing the financial burden of the family along with their responsibilities as a wife and mother, this fact that women in full-time employment is an added perk besides being a homemaker is a highly ignored truth. In other words, women are being bullied by the society for fulfilling their actual and core role – a homemaker. We see a lot of examples these days that if an educated married woman is not working outside and serving her husband and rearing her kids, she is highly looked down upon. She attracts terms like ‘non-working’ and ‘husband-dependent’ despite her noble, full-time job as somebody who is ‘building’ a home, community and ‘uplifting’ individuals like her husband and kids.

Sunila has been working in a school as a full-time teacher since the last six years. Four years ago, she got married, and soon after she became a mom. Being married to someone who is constantly based outside the valley and living all by themselves in a nuclear family was not an easy task for her. She made up her mind to be a stay-at-home mom and take care of her newborn until the child entered school. However, the opposition she faced from her circle of friends and family members to keep working made her reluctant to do so. She got programmed in her mind that these few years of her life are her productive years, and she should not tamper with her career and so on. Hence, she continued working for a not-so-sophisticated income just for the sake of her ‘career’, leaving her eight-month-old in a day care centre. The real problem appeared when the child would fall ill and she was forced to take several days off. All the mental stress, moments of loneliness and burnout involved behind the scene are a whole new story.
Babita has been a full-time homemaker since the time she got married. She has raised a seven- year-old and looks after the academic, social and moral needs of her child, being an educated woman. However, she has not stopped being criticised and tormented with words like ‘unmotivated’ and ‘comfort-loving’ by the people in her circle. She explains how words like those hit her self-esteem and sometimes feel like going back to work, but restrains herself because she is the only one who can identify the ways she is investing upon her child.
As commercial as today’s world has become, practically everything is weighed in terms of monetary value. It is important, however, to acknowledge that during the generative phase of adulthood, parents must address and invest in the physical, mental, social, emotional and cognitive needs of their child. Even a mere presence of one of the parents with them during the growing years can have a lasting positive impact on the proper development of the child. But being overindulgent in long duty hours and being stressed out after the working hours, not being able to invest time and words in the child can lead to a lack of belongingness and love in him/her.
The result is evident. Emotional issues like anxiety and depression, social issues like rebellion, degrading sense of respect and identity crises are at an alarmingly higher level among today’s youth, more than ever in history. If someone asks what a full-time homemaker can do, we can show them that she actually builds up an individual. Not to forget that an individual is the building block of society and nation. This simple fact, not being displayed in many societies today has caused them to be doomed.
Does it mean that women should not work outside at all? Of course not!  She should, but not at the cost of the well-being of her family, for whom she is like a cornerstone. Women in ancient days had societal roles. But their societal roles were not glorified over their roles as a wife and mother. Unlike today, their identity was not based on what and how they were performing outside or how much they were earning. A greater theme of women empowerment is to give her the freedom to be productive inside and outside her home, not pressurising her to a point that she would suffer a burnout in her important roles that are instrumental for the well-being of society.
I know a lot of moms who regret their decisions to be overindulgent in work that their children couldn’t achieve their potential in emotional, mental, cognitive and social grounds. On the contrary, there are those happy moms who find fulfillment in shaping their children as stable, honoured and fruitful members of society. That must be an awesome feeling! Hats off to all the women who are working hard to address the financial needs of their family! Also hats off to all the wonderful women who have made up their minds to prepare and nurture the family being a ‘Happy Homemaker.’

299,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/effects-of-solar-eclipse-on-eyes/,"In view of the solar eclipse on the new moon day of December 26, this article aims to enlighten the facts and debunk a few misconceptions. The partial eclipse will be seen from parts of Kathmandu, starting at 8:43 am and end at 11:31 am, with the peak at 10:01 am.
For the first time, in the 18th century, evidence was found about the harmful effects on the eye caused by watching a solar eclipse. The effect depends upon the amount of radiation and exposure to it. The effects are caused due to the heat induced photo-chemical process.
The ultra-violet rays affect the skin (red blisters or carcinogenic effects), its heat affects the retina and incites many other problems. The partial solar eclipse can be viewed with the naked eyes only for a few seconds, but a total solar eclipse—to be seen on August 21—is never safe to watch with the naked eyes.
Even when 99 per cent of the sun is covered by the moon, it is not safe to watch it without precautionary measures. This is because the harmful rays coming from the remaining 1 per cent of the sun especially affects the cornea of our eyes.
A black spot in the middle of the visual field shall always remain due to the permanent and irreversible damage to the centre of the retina. Why is it more harmful to watch the sun during a solar eclipse than at any other time? During an eclipse, the sun is blocked by the moon, and there is darkness all around for a while.
At this time, the pupil of our eye is dilated, and suddenly when some portion of the sun becomes visible, many harmful rays enter our eyes that even penetrate parts of the retina. On a normal day, the sun is so bright that we cannot look at it.
Similarly, at the time of the eclipse, the earth, the moon and the sun fall on the same plane in a straight line, causing the gravitational pull of each of the celestial bodies to combine. As a result, harmful rays, which would otherwise scatter in any other direction in space, are streamlined to precipitate onto the Earth. Radons are among those harmful rays, which can easily set in damp or wet materials for some time. So, there are scientific grounds for the old belief that water and food items exposed to the eclipse should not be consumed.
It is best not to watch a solar eclipse. It is heard on the grapevine that looking through a medical x-ray film, photo negatives or polarising spectacles saves eyes from those harmful rays, which is not true.

300,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/earthquake-reconstruction-challenge-to-save-social-aura/,"The government-approved house map for the quake-hit areas should be designed by analysing the socio-cultural and geographical context. Following the Gorkha quake, people decided on RCC construction because they thought it was safer
Nepal is multi-hazardous country, and the government has been implementing a National Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Act since 2018 in line with the global plan of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2018-2030. The impact of climate change has been directly and indirectly seen in the country, with reoccurrences of mini-typhoons, drought, heavy rains, extreme heat and thunderbolt. Similarly, Nepal was witness to a strong earthquake in 2015.
Earthquake reconstruction is running in its fifth year. Retrofitting and new construction have been rapidly moving ahead. With federalism in place, the local authority has taken up the major responsibility of earthquake reconstruction. Proper implementation of earthquake-resistant construction practices and their institutionalisation are a burning issue in the quake-hit districts.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
The data of the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) show that almost 62 per cent of housing construction has been completed till now. According to the Post Disaster Need Assessment (PDNA) report, more than 850,000 residential buildings, 5,000 schools and 1,000 health facilities were damaged in the Gorkha Earthquake-2015. In addition, government and public buildings were also damaged on a massive scale. NRA has a plan to complete and achieve the targeted goal of reconstruction by January 2020.
Supporting the mission of the government are numerous I/NGOs in different districts. The government has provided a housing grant of $3,000 to each affected family, which has still not been taken by all those entitled due to socio-cultural difficulties and challenges faced in housing construction. There is difficulty in managing construction materials and workers in housing construction while lack of trained technical manpower is another challenge. The approval of housing design is highly complex for particular target groups as the nation’s geographical and socio-cultural diversity demands diversity in construction design and approach.
RCC construction is the current mode of construction, which is expensive and costly for the people of the rural areas. Also, the procurement, transportation of construction materials and workmanship make housing construction expensive. The overall construction or maintenance cost is high, and the subsidy doesn’t cover even 50 percent of the cost. In the hilly and mountainous districts, transportation of construction materials is difficult during the monsoon, and there is water scarcity for construction in the winter season. So the use of local materials is far better than adopting modern construction materials and technology.
Hence, user-friendly or community-friendly designs are a must for rural reconstruction. A few settlements and communities are building houses to fulfill the reconstruction ritual. Such buildings have one or two rooms, making it difficult to meet the needs of a family.
On the other hand, high-rise apartments are coming up in the semi-urban and urban settlements. These constructions clearly exceed the height recommended in the country’s seismic building code, underlining the challenge of enforcing implementation. There is a clear gap between the haves and have nots, which is impacting the reconstruction process and progress. The government has been implementing the Building Code since 2003, but is still facing difficulty in implementing it in the field, so necessary to reduce the disaster risks.
Earlier construction practices of Nepal were unique in architecture. The traditional roofing, artistic wooden frame and design were typical. They were geographically and socio-culturally friendly but vanished in the post-earthquake reconstruction. The straw and stone slate roofing has given way to concrete construction, in which Nepali originality and socio-cultural diversity have been lost. Thus, the traditional aura in a building has been lost. From the eyes of social science or sociological perspective, this is a critical issue that has been raised in earthquake reconstruction.
Therefore, the government has to frame a strategy to use local materials rather than the RCC model for housing construction. The government-approved house map for the quake-hit areas should be designed by analysing the socio-cultural and geographical context. Following the Gorkha Earthquake, the beneficiaries decided on RCC construction because they thought it was safer than masonry work. But senior engineers and DRR experts claim that masonry buildings can easily resist an earthquake just like the RCC. Certainly, our ancestors designed and constructed buildings that were geographically and socio-culturally-friendly, which were beautiful, environment-friendly and healthy to live in. Therefore, the Himal, Tarai and Hilly regions have their unique types of construction practices, and the local authority has to take the lead in protecting the local cultural diversity.
In the post-quake reconstruction, entire settlements have migrated to the urban areas or cities of concrete. Interestingly, the government is planning 2020 as tourism year, but the originality of settlements is being lost day by day. Therefore, to maintain the aura, originality and glory of a community, citizens must share some responsibility, and the local authority has to develop a certain code for housing construction and land plotting.

301,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/discrimination-in-sports/,"The 13th edition of the South Asian Games (SAG) has completed successfully. Deepest gratitude to all the medalists, officials and team managers for handing over the highest number of medals ever in the SAG for Nepal. Multiple countries have been congratulating Nepal for its new record, and we sportspersons too are extremely glad of this achievement.
Indeed, this time, athletes contributed a lot for the SAG. Now, in return, it is the responsibility of the government to improve the sports sector. It has announced to honour the gold medalists with a   cash prize of Rs 9 lakhs, but the point is, how long will an athlete run with this amount of money? Until and unless all the three tiers of government (central, provincial and local level) work with a vision to improve the sports sector, our Nepali athletes will not be able to bag medals in the Asian Games and Olympics.
What did the government do in honour of the medalists? A city rally! But for an athlete, who toils day and night and fights to make the motherland proud, their victory should not be confined only to a cash honour and a city round.
If the nation really wants to develop sports, it should treat it as a mission. A motivating environment must be built in the nation by erecting quality sports infrastructure and facilities, otherwise it will hard to retain good sportspersons.
In respect to the historic win in the SAG, the government has honored the medalists with some cash prizes but has discriminated against the international judges, who played an important role in the successful completion of this SAG. In the 13th SAG, the organisers had accommodated all the guest judges from different countries well, but we international judges of the host country experienced the worst management in terms of accommodation and food. It’s a pity that we international judges have always been forced to use our own pocket money for referee seminars, refresher training and license renewals every year.
While the medalists were honoured with cash for their achievement, the international judges saw their allowance cut off by almost 50 per cent.
Such a frame of mind will not help motivate the officials to contribute their best for the upcoming events. It is extremely painful to see the misuse of power and politicisation of the Nepali sports sector. While our neighbouring countries allocate heavily to sports, Nepal spends just 0.015 per cent of the total budget on it.

302,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-wrong-treatment/,"One fails to understand why the attending doctors did not refer the child to some other hospital for better expert advice
Nepal is not new to reports about doctors’ negligence and errors in the treatment of patients, leading to complications, death or disability for life. Medical treatment in a private hospital in Nepal is very expensive, but still people opt for it, with the belief that money will cure them of their disease and agony. But time and again, even prestigious hospitals are in the news for giving the wrong medication and lengthening the stay of the patients unnecessarily. Nepal Medical Council (NMC) has just concluded that the doctors of Kathmandu-based Grande International Hospital committed three mistakes in the treatment of the child born of Sanjeev Neupane and Ekta Ghimire, which led to one complication after another, with the child, now 18 months old, fighting for his life. The incident is just one of a series of inaccurate diagnoses and wrong treatments that the hospital has been blamed for in recent times. The NMC has noted that Neupane and Ghimire’s child had been given an overdose of paracetamol while there was a misunderstanding between the radiologist and neurosurgeons on the size of the excess cerebrospinal fluid that had built up in the brain. The NMC committee has also pointed out that a CT scan or MRI had been delayed against the advice of the radiologist.
All in all, five surgeries of the head and months of stay in the expensive hospital have cost the parents millions of rupees in treatment costs, while being little informed about the treatment procedures. The mistakes committed by the hospital and doctors go against the medical code of conduct, which requires a doctor to be God like in his ability, knowledge and demeanour, but human in caring for his patients. In the decision letters given to the hospital and doctors, the NMC has asked the paediatrician involved in the treatment of the child be kept in probation period of one week under the supervision of an expert, while the neurosurgeon has been given a last warning. It must be really traumatic for the parents to be looking after their child, knowing fully well that he will never regain his health.
The NMC is not in a position to dictate if the hospital should pay compensation to the victim’s family for the medical misadventure. And even if the hospital were to pay, no amount of financial reparation is going to compensate for the trauma caused to the parents and their child. To prevent such bitter occurrences in the future, it is only right that the doctors should take the medical code of ethics to heart. In the above incident, it is clear that the standard care procedures were not followed, which amounts to medical negligence. As the NMC has noted, no humanitarian concern had been shown even when the health condition of the baby was critical. One fails to understand why the attending doctors did not refer the child to some other hospital for better expert advice instead of experimenting with one treatment after another, which continued for months. Medical service has now become something like a consumer good, where the patients are the consumers and medical personnel, the service providers. So, patients will seek delivery of quality medical service, especially if they have paid good money for it.

Protect public land
The tendency of encroaching on public land belonging to forest or public institutions is on the rise due to the government’s inaction. Minister for Land Management and Cooperatives Padma Aryal the other day said over 13,000 bighas of land had been captured by individuals across the country. This is a serious case, and the government must take strong action against those occupying public land.
A report from Banke states that 76 families had been occupying over three bighas of land belonging to Adarsha Secondary School in Nepalgunj Sub-Metropolis-20 for many years. The houses and sheds built over there were demolished with the help of the local administration only after a complaint was lodged against the encroachers with Hello Sarkar. The land was registered in the school’s name some 40 years ago. But the encroachers, who claim to be landless squatters, have vowed to recapture it. The land should be used for educational purpose only, and the school management needs to protect its land by putting up fences around it. As far as the squatters’ problem is concerned, the government should find an alternative to resettle them elsewhere along with the provision of jobs available at the local levels.

Even as the government is all set to endorse the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Nepal Compact Programme by the Federal Parliament during the ongoing winter session, a new debate has now surfaced whether the US assistance is a part of the broader Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) put forth by the US. The US is providing US$ 500 million to Nepal under the grant assistance for the construction of high voltage transmission lines and upgradation of the existing strategic roads to give a boost to the national economy. Then finance minister Gyanendra Bahadur Kakri had signed the deal in Washington on September 14, 2017, well before the USA came up with the IPS – an economic, good governance and military and defense cooperation pact among the member states in the Indo-Pacific region. Nepal will also have to contribute US$ 130 million as matching fund to the MCC. The differences of opinion regarding the MCC surfaced during the weeklong standing committee meeting of the ruling Nepal Communist Party. Some of the NCP members claimed that it was a part of the IPS while Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali insisted that it was not, as the MCC was envisaged in 2004 while the IPS came into being only in 2017. NCP Co-Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal said that the MCC could be taken for implementation only after the US clarified that it is not a part of the IPS.
Some of the clauses in the MCC are contentious. The MCC agreement demands endorsement from the Federal Parliament whereas constitutional experts believe it is not necessary to have it passed through the Parliament. Article 7 (7.1), for example, states that after the said agreement comes into force, it shall prevail in case it contradicts Nepal’s law. Likewise, Article 3 (3.8 a) requires auditing of the MCC project be carried out only by a US firm. Since Nepal is also putting in money to the project, Nepal’s Office of the Auditor’s General should also have the right to carry out the project’s auditing. Likewise, Article 5 (5.1 a and b) states that the US government can terminate the deal at any time by giving a written notification to Nepal. But Nepal cannot do so. These are some of the controversial clauses that need to be rectified before Nepal’s Parliament endorses it.
Foreign Minister Gyawali is insisting that the MCC should not be looked at from the IPS perspectives. Some of the countries in Europe, Central Asia, West Africa and Latin America have also joined the MCC in the same manner as Nepal and Sri Lanka have done. As the dispute has already surfaced, both the US and Nepal must sit together and sort out the differences. It shows there are some lapses that should be resolved before it comes into implementation. On the other hand, the US government also needs to clarify the doubts raised about the MCC. As a non-aligned country, Nepal has clearly stated that it cannot be a part of any military alliance. However, given the huge volume of grant assistance that the US is providing, Nepal can ill afford to lose it as it will help overall development of the country, especially in the energy sector and better road connectivity. With the grant assistance, Nepal will also acquire new technology and management skills. The MCC must take off for the mutual interests of both the countries.

Retaining students
The school enrollment campaign might be a success, but retaining the students until they complete secondary school is proving to be a challenge, with children dropping out mid-way, especially those coming from the Dalit communities. This has been the case of children from the Musahar and Bantar communities in the Tarai district of Mahottari. Enrolling and retaining have been particularly difficult in the case of the girl child. Having a provision for free education in the new constitution is not enough to improve learning among the Dalit and poor children if they do not see any value in attending school.
There are many reasons why children drop out of school, and they are not limited to illiteracy among the parents and poverty at home. The attitude of the teachers towards the Dalit children could be a prime factor. Given the family environment back home, such children need extra attention and encouragement if they are to perform at par with their better-off classmates. Mid-day meals for the poor students could be an incentive to attend school. In the later years, a vocational skill will prove much more productive than studying subjects students will never make use of in their life.

Letter to the Editor
Clarification by MCA-Nepal
Our organisation’s attention has been drawn towards an editorial published in your reputed news daily on December 23 entitled “Clear the confusions” that had some factual inaccuracies with regard to the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact clauses.
Firstly, the editorial mentions MCC agreement demands endorsement from the Federal Parliament whereas constitutional experts believe it is not necessary to have it passed through the Parliament. The truth is the Government of Nepal decided to send it for Parliamentary ratification after a well-thought legal opinion and thorough consideration by the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. Additionally, all MCC Compacts worldwide are implemented only after a Parliamentary ratification.
Secondly, it mentions that Article 3 (3.8 a) requires auditing of the MCC project to be carried out only by a US firm. This is totally false. The last sentence of the same article states that the Auditor General of Nepal can audit it at any given time. Also, the Formation Order issued by the Government of Nepal clearly mentions in Section 11 that MCA-Nepal will be audited by the Auditor General of Nepal.
Thirdly, it mentions that Article 5 (5.1 a and b) states that the US government can terminate the deal at any time by giving a written notification to Nepal. But Nepal cannot do so. This is highly untrue. The same article also states that either party can terminate the Compact without cause by giving 30 days’ prior written notice.
MCA-Nepal, established under Nepal’s own legislative process, entrusted with and committed to delivering the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact, requests a reputed daily such as yours to report to the public the above facts with due diligence.

As a tiger range country, Nepal is considered both a source and a transit point
The very image of a tiger creates a feeling of fear and respect for the majestic animal. It has no known predator and is at the top of the food chain. Conservationists often refer to the tiger as a “keystone” or “flagship” species. A healthy tiger population indicates the good health of the related ecosystem along with a good prey base and habitat for the wild animals it preys on. It is said the big cat needs 200-250 kilos of flesh a week to sustain. The Royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) found in Nepal’s lowland forests, northern India, Bhutan and Bangladesh is one of the five remaining species of tiger found in the world today.

Following the eradication of malaria in the country in the late 1950s, there was large-scale migration of the hill people to the fertile lands of the southern plains. In the ensuing years and decades, there was unchecked deforestation for agricultural and infrastructure development. A rapidly growing human population coupled with subsistence agricultural practices not only degraded the prime tiger habitat there but also relegated the dwindled tiger population to the confines of wildlife sanctuaries.
Despite the subsequent conservation measures, this magnificent animal is highly endangered and is still faced with the threat of extinction. Elsewhere, Balinese and Caspian tigers are already extinct, whereas the Javan tiger is believed to have disappeared in the 1980s.
The major challenges of tiger conservation include habitat loss due to burgeoning human population, poaching and illegal trade in its body parts. Conflict between the local inhabitants and wildlife occurs when herbivores damage crops in the adjoining field or tigers kill their domestic animals.
Despite the legal provision of a hefty fine or a prison sentence (or both) for killing a tiger as well as a compensation scheme for crop or livestock damage, affected locals sometimes resort to retaliatory killings. Tigers are elusive and avoid humans.
Unfortunately, sometimes human life is lost in a tragic encounter between the two. There is a compensation scheme for the loss of life or injuries sustained in a tiger attack.
Increasing international demand for tiger skin and bone has fuelled the illegal trade in its body parts, thereby threatening the long-term survival of this endangered wildlife. Tiger bone is used in some oriental traditional medicine for its so-called aphrodisiac properties.
Being one of the tiger range countries, Nepal is considered both a source (country) and a transit point. Nepal’s legislation regards wildlife crime as an organised crime and prohibits trade in tiger parts in and out of the country.
Despite the minimisation of poaching and illegal trade in tiger parts, opportunistic poaching still remains a problem. In the past decade, 49 tiger skins and 204 kilos of tiger bones were seized, while 2,258 people were arrested for their involvement in wildlife-related crime.
As long as there is a demand for tiger parts in consumer countries, Nepal will face the threat of tiger poaching.
The first tiger conservation initiative can be traced back to 1972, when the government, WWF-US and the Smithsonian Institute jointly launched the Tiger Ecology Project in Chitwan. The early conservation emphasis was on species preservation and adherence to strict law enforcement practices.  Apart from the park-people conflict on the fringe of the forested areas, the lesson learned over the years was that a more conciliatory approach was needed to win the support of the local people for the long-term survival of this marvel of nature, now confined to the island-like national parks.
Nepal’s commitment to tiger conservation is eventually yielding results. The tiger count conducted in 2018 has recorded 235 tigers in the wild. The earlier census of 2009 had recorded 121 individuals. The result shows the country is close to doubling its tiger population and achieving the global commitment made at the 2010 St. Petersburg Summit in Russia.
WWF Nepal has joined hands and worked with the Government of Nepal (GoN) for over two decades in creating awareness and opportunities of sources of local livelihood, community forestry in the degraded patches of forests, and anti poaching. Community involvement in conservation is showing positive signs as Nepal has witnessed zero-poaching (of rhinoceros) year several times.
Jointly launched by GoN and WWF in 2001, the Tarai Arc Landscape (TAL) Programme aims to secure a larger area for tiger conservation by building connectivity between adjacent protected areas and forests within the country as well as between the forests of the trans-border areas of Nepal and India, with biological corridors to facilitate dispersal of this endangered species. Mega terrestrial wildlife such as the wild Asian elephant and the Greater one-horned rhinoceros have been sighted in the corridor forests. Moreover, tiger movement has been recorded in the Khata corridor, which provides connectivity between Nepal’s Bardia National Park and the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary of India.
Experts say national effort alone will not be enough to deal with the nexus of illegal dealers in international trade in tiger parts and that tiger range countries need to meet regularly to address this thorny issue. Nepal has already initiated talks on the matter with neighbouring countries.

305,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/embarrassing-moment/,"This was Ken’s fifth consecutive annual visit to India from his native land, the United Kingdom. But unlike his previous four visits, this time he had brought Joe, his friend, along. Ken was a retired military man who enjoyed trotting the globe.
“I have had a close brush with the cultures and cuisines of almost all nations, but I am smitten with India’s rich cultural heritage,” said Ken when I was introduced to him by the principal of our college. I was assigned the lovely job of interpreter for both the guests during their stay with us. While having interactions with them in the queen’s tongue, I was not only enthusiastic but also marvelled at their profound curiosity to dig deeper into our cultural mines.
Ken’s inquisitiveness was quite inspiring, questioning me about all the famous places of Amritsar that we all visited together. A sense of deep piety overwhelmed Ken and Joe when I expounded on the glorious religious history of The Golden Temple. But the bloody well and the chest-piercing bullet marks at Jaliyah Wala Bhag welled up tears in their eyes.
They were perhaps experiencing a sort of remorse within for what their countrymen had done to our citizens when we were a colony of the British. But I was more inclined to know what tempted these foreign birds of exotic wings to fly to India over and over again.
Though Joe was just a fun-grabber wanting to have a first-hand experience of the Indian ways of life, for Ken it was his quest for spirituality that had brought him to India on several occasions. Ken had developed a close connect with some great Indian mystics also. He had come to practise esoteric oriental meditation under their tutelage. Playing a good host and offering them our cuisines and cultural bonanza brought a heightened sense of joy and pride to me.
But these feelings were short-lived. I had to hang my head in shame when my foreign friends enquired about the gruesome rape of a doctor from Hyderabad (Telengana). Here my skills in speech failed me badly.
In a bid to end my embarrassment, they deliberately changed the course of their conversation to the marvellous Indian culture again. But I was still unable to compose myself. What messages were we Indians spreading across the world? Was our country now getting transformed from a rich land of spirituality to the land of sexual perversity? I was no more able to have eye contact with my foreign guests.

306,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/tests-begin-on-bones-that-may-be-revolutionary-war-soldiers/,"NORTH HAVEN, CONNECTICUT: A university laboratory began tests Friday on skeletal remains found beneath an 18th century home in the hopes of identifying the three people believed to be soldiers killed during the Revolutionary War.
In December, while homeowners were renovating their house in Ridgefield, the remains were discovered in a grave under the foundation.
“These bones are so robust, they’re dense, they’re thick with muscle attachments (and) they’re long,” said Nick Bellantoni, emeritus state archaeologist of the Connecticut Museum of Natural History. “Who exactly they are, we are hoping the forensic work will show.”
The skull of one of the skeletal remains found buried in underneath a home that dates back to 1790, sits in a computerized tomography (CT) scan machine at Quinnipiac University’s Center for Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, on Friday, January 3, 2020, in North Haven, Connecticut. Photo: AP
While much remains unknown, researchers believe the remains belonged to men and possibly date to the Battle of Ridgefield, which occurred in April 1777. The way the men were buried in a haphazard grave also lends credibility to the idea that they were victims of the Battle of Ridgefield.
“They’re actually laying on top of each other overlapped,” Bellantoni said.
If confirmed, Bellantoni said that would make them the first remains from a Revolutionary War soldier recovered in Connecticut.
Bellantoni said the medical examiner quickly suspected the bones were very old because older bones tend to have less organic matter and start to flake over time.

Copper buttons found with the remains could indicate they belonged to militiamen.
While researchers suspect they might be soldiers, they don’t know if they might be British or American.
The bones are being analyzed at Quinnipiac University’s Center for Medicine, Nursing and Health Science in North Haven.
Jaime Ullinger, director of anthropology at the university, said they are starting to conduct X-ray analysis on the bones to help examine parts of the skeleton that have deteriorated over time.
She said that, even before the remains are identified, researchers will be able to gather other kinds of information, such as what kind of diet the men had and more broadly where they might be from.
Tania Grgurich, clinical associate professor of diagnostic imaging at the university, said it is an important opportunity to learn about history and for staff and students to be up close with unusual remains.
“This is part of our history, potentially, and then these are human beings that are being unearthed,” she said. “It’s not that often that something like this happens.”

307,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/digging-up-the-dirt-could-soil-contain-the-answer-to-food-shortages/,"
ROME: As water shortages, high temperatures and rising greenhouse gas emissions threaten food production, countries around the world are looking somewhere new for solutions – the soil.
For decades, farmers wanting to boost their yields have focused their attention on fertilisers, technology and new seed varieties.
Instead, they should be looking under their feet, according to experts, who warn that years of erosion and degradation of the soil through intensive farming have created the conditions for a global food production crisis.
“Data suggests that if we do not restore global soil health, it is highly likely the consequences within 10 years will be many, many millions facing food and water insecurity,” British soil expert John Crawford told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
This could lead to “civil unrest, mass migration, radicalisation and violence on an unprecedented scale,” said Crawford, until recently a science director at the world’s oldest agricultural research institute, Rothamsted Research.
Much of the problem is caused by erosion, which strips away the highly fertile top layer of soil. An area of soil the size of a soccer pitch is eroded every five seconds, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
While soil erosion occurs naturally, human activities such as intensive agriculture, deforestation and urban sprawl have significantly increased the rate at which it is happening.
Nearly a third of Earth’s soil is already degraded. At current rates, that will increase to 90% by 2050, the FAO forecasts, warning that pollution from human activity such as mining and manufacturing as well as erosion are to blame.
There are signs the world is beginning to wake up to the issue, which Crawford said it had only about 10 to 15 years to sort out.
Soil is “one of the most important regulators of global climate” because it stores more carbon than the planet’s atmosphere and vegetation combined, he said.
“If you fix soil, you mitigate a whole bunch of other risks,” added Crawford, now professor of technology and strategy at the Adam Smith Business School in Glasgow.
Whole Foods, the upscale US retailer that made its name selling organic food, has put “regenerative agriculture” – farming that focuses on soil health – at the top of its trends for 2020.
LOW-COST TESTING
From Iowa to the Ayeyarwady delta region of Myanmar – known as the country’s rice bowl – farmers are trying to figure out how to make their soil healthier and more productive.
In a remote village in the Ayeyarwady delta recently, a group of farmers sat cross-legged on a wooden floor and discussed why their once-thriving farms had become less productive.
The men had started testing their soil for the first time with the help of Proximity Designs, a business that designs low-cost farming products.
The company only began offering low-cost soil testing services in Myanmar in 2018 and by last October it had already sold more than 7,600 tests at $17 each, highlighting farmer interest.
“We didn’t have anyone to teach us (about soil). We followed suggestions from others, thinking they might work,” said Win Zaw, 44, who grows rice twice a year on his six-acre (2.4-hectare) farm.
“We knew something was wrong, but didn’t know what to do,” he said, looking down at neatly-typed sheets of paper detailing the levels of nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, acidity and organic matter in the soil.
All the farms were showing very low organic matter, which is produced by decomposing plants and is key to good soil health.
Proximity Designs’ agronomists said this was likely due partly to the warm climate, which degrades organic matter more quickly, and partly to local farming practices.
Their recommendations were relatively simple: leave crop residues after the harvest to retain the moisture in the soil, or sow cover crops – those planted to protect the soil between rice plantings rather than for commercial reasons.
When it came to fertiliser use, the recommended amount was much lower than what the farmers were using.
“Applying farming practices without knowing what’s happening in the soil can lead to crop failures, soil degradation, environmental damage and ecosystem breakdown,” said Proximity founder Debbie Aung Din.
‘ALLY OR ENEMY’
In Iowa, a state in the US Midwest known for its cornfields, farmers are increasingly seeking to improve soil health, said Richard Cruse, a professor at Iowa State University’s agronomy department.
“We see increasing numbers of cover crops that are being planted. We’re increasing the rate of no-till adoption,” he said, referring to a method of farming without tilling the soil that is said to reduce erosion.
“I’ve talked to several (farmers) in my area who are saying, ‘We have to do something different’.”
But many lack the expertise and skills, while farmers who rent say it is not worth investing in land that they do not own.
“In Iowa, more than half of the farmland is managed by farmers that don’t own the land,” said Cruse.
“I’ve had multiple farmers tell me, ‘conservation practices on land that I rent is a cost’.”
Ronald Vargas, land and water officer for the FAO and secretary of the Global Soils Partnership – a key player in pushing this issue – said farmers had to be given advice and incentives.
“Soil can be your ally or your enemy,” he said. “But in many countries, farmers are left alone. There is nobody advising them.”

308,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/century-old-tb-vaccine-may-work-better-if-given-in-a-new-way/,"WASHINGTON: Scientists think they’ve figured out how to make a century-old tuberculosis vaccine far more protective: Simply give the shot a different way.
In a study with monkeys, injecting the vaccine straight into the bloodstream dramatically improved its effectiveness over today’s skin-deep shot, researchers reported Wednesday.
“This offers hope,” although more safety studies are required before testing the approach in people, said Dr Robert Seder of the National Institutes of Health, a senior author of the study.
Tuberculosis kills about 1.7 million people a year, mostly in poor countries. The only vaccine, called the BCG vaccine, is used mainly in high-risk areas to protect babies from one form of the disease. But it’s far less effective at protecting teens and adults from the main threat, TB in the lungs.
Most vaccines are shots jabbed in the muscle or skin. Seder came up with the idea of IV immunization a few years ago, with experiments showing a malaria vaccine candidate worked better when injected into a vein. He wondered if the TB vaccine would react the same way.

Researchers at NIH teamed with the University of Pittsburgh to study certain monkeys, rhesus macaques, that react to TB infection much like people do. They tested a variety of ways to give the TB vaccine, including a mist that the monkeys inhaled through a mask.
Six months after the vaccinations, the researchers delivered TB bacteria straight into the animals’ lungs and watched for infection. Monkeys given today’s standard skin shot, even with a higher dose, were only slightly more protected than unvaccinated animals, and the mist wasn’t too effective, either.
But in 9 of 10 monkeys, a higher-than-usual vaccine dose injected into a vein worked much better, the researchers reported in the journal Nature. The team found no trace of infection in six of the animals and counted very low levels of TB bacteria in the lungs of three.
Why? The hypothesis is that key immune cells called T cells have to swarm the lungs to kill off TB bacteria and can do so more quickly when the vaccine is carried rapidly around the body via the bloodstream. Sure enough, tests showed more active T cells lingering in the lungs of monkeys vaccinated the new way.
The findings are striking, showing that how a vaccine is given “clearly affects immunity,” University of Massachusetts TB specialists Samuel Behar and Chris Sassetti, who weren’t involved in the study, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Still, giving a vaccine intravenously isn’t nearly as easy as other kinds of shots, they cautioned.
Seder said additional safety research is underway in animals, with hopes of beginning a first-step study in people in about 18 months.

309,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/india-approves-third-moon-mission-months-after-landing-failure/,"BENGALURU: India has approved its third lunar mission months after its last one failed to successfully land on the moon, its space agency said on Wednesday, the latest effort in its ambitions to become a low-cost space power.
The Chandrayaan-3 mission will have a lander and a rover, but not an orbiter, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman K Sivan told reporters at its headquarters in Bengaluru, according to an official telecast.
The Chandrayaan-2 mission in September successfully deployed a lunar orbiter that relays scientific data back to earth, but was unable to place a rover on the lunar surface after a “hard” landing.
That mission had aimed to land on the south pole of the moon, where no other lunar mission had gone before. The region is believed to contain water as craters in the region are largely unaffected by the high temperatures of the sun.
ISRO had hoped to confirm the presence of water in the form of ice, first detected on its mission in 2008.
Chandrayaan-3 will have a “similar configuration” as the previous mission, Sivan said.
Only the United States, Russia and China have landed on the moon. Beijing’s Chang’e-4 probe touched down on the far side of the moon last year, while Israel made an unsuccessful attempt to land its Beresheet spacecraft on the moon in April 2019.
India’s third lunar mission will likely launch in 2020 and will cost less than its previous mission, the PTI news agency reported on Tuesday, citing Jitendra Singh, junior minister for the department of space.
Sivan also said ISRO was making “good progress” for its human space-flight mission slated for late 2021, adding that four astronauts had been picked for training, which will be planned later this month. The project, called Gaganyaan, would cost less than 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion), the government said in 2018.
India has developed a reputation for pioneering affordable satellite launches and space missions. Its unmanned Mars mission in 2014 cost just $74 million, less than the budget of the Hollywood space blockbuster “Gravity”.
Sivan also announced that ISRO had begun the land acquisition process for a second spaceport in the southern port city of Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu state.

311,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/decade-in-review-what-the-smartphone-has-wrought/,"Dec 23: When the first Apple iPhone hit the market in 2007, not everyone was convinced it would supplant the flip-phone. When Google’s Android software system arrived a year later, the Blackberry still seemed to have bright future.
But with the iPhone 4 in 2010, featuring a high-resolution display, sleek design and front-facing camera, our collective fate was sealed. Here are 10 ways the smartphone has made its mark over the decade.
Access everywhere
Today some 5 billion smartphones are in use around the world, according to Canalys Research. The total number of internet subscriptions has soared to 7.2 billion globally from 1.3 billion in 2010, the vast majority of them mobile subscriptions, International Telecommunications Union data shows. The explosion in connectivity has been especially dramatic in the developing world, where there are now more mobile connections than people.
Tech uber alles
Apple Inc, once a niche computer company, is now one of the world’s most valuable companies thanks to the iPhone. The five largest Fortune 500 technology companies – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook – currently boast a market cap of $4.7 trillion, compared with about $800 billion for the top five in 2010. Not all of that is due to the smartphone, of course, but the mobile-related technologies and services accounted for nearly $4 trillion in economic activity in 2018, according to trade group GSMA.
There’s an app for that
Whether we’re hailing a cab, ordering food, playing a game, finding a date, listening to music or shopping for just about anything, there’s a good chance we’ll be doing it with a smartphone app that didn’t exist in 2010. Many of most popular apps are free, but consumers are still expected to spend more than $120 billion in app stores during 2019, according to App Annie, a mobile apps analytics firm.
Feed me
The endless scroll on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media apps now consumes 34 minutes of every U.S. adult’s day, according to Nielsen. Fewer people are sitting on the sofa to watch live TV at set times, and advertisers are following. Mobile ad spending surpassed TV for the first time in 2018 in terms of percentage share of the U.S. market, according to research firm eMarketer. We can also thank the smartphone for Instagram influencers, “sextortion,” and fake news.
Smile for the (smartphone) camera
Global shipments of digital cameras dropped from their 2010 peak of 121 million to just 19 million units in 2018, according to the Camera & Imaging Products Association (CIPA). Meantime the latest phones pack as many four camera lenses and cutting edge software that makes it easier than ever to get that perfect shot. The front-facing camera might be the busiest: Google reports that its Android devices take 93 million selfies every day.
Where am I?
The satellite tracking technology known as GPS, combined with information from cell towers and Wi-Fi networks, has made the smartphones incredibly powerful tracking devices. Google maps and its poorer cousins enable even the most directionally impaired find their way around unfamiliar locales with ease.
For the privacy-minded, though, it’s a disaster: Phone companies and app makers routinely record the movements of subscribers and sell that data to advertisers, a $20 billion-a-year business. The data is “anonymized,” but as numerous studies and a recent New York Times investigation have revealed it is often a simple matter to identify who is behind the dot on the map. Nearly 50% of companies surveyed by Verizon this year used or planned to soon use smartphone management tools to track their employees.
You can look it up
The 2010 edition of the venerable Encyclopedia Britannica, all 32 volumes and 129 pounds of it, turned out to be the last. But untold barroom arguments or dining room debates can now be settled on the spot: Wikipedia is consulted more than 240 million times daily.
Distracting ourselves to death
In 2018 alone in the United States, 2,628 fatal crashes involved a distracted driver, and of those deadly crashes, about 13% involved mobile phone use, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
Forget your wallet
Apple Pay and Google Pay are still afterthoughts for most U.S. consumers, but China may be a harbinger. Alipay and WeChat pay, China’s two big smartphone payment services, have reached a combined adoption rate of over 80% since they were launched around the beginning of the decade, according to a study by Bain. The QR code now peppers storefront windows. Even streetside beggars have adapted, sometimes rejecting cash and asking that payments be made via WeChat Pay or Alipay.
Say what?
Among the major casualties of the smartphone era is the conventional phone call itself: ubiquitous messaging apps have helped make video calls, GIFs, emojis and audio messaging preferred modes of communication. In the UK, for example, the total number of minutes spent on voice calls fell from 254 billion in 2013 to 206 billion in 2018, and the number of text messages dropped from 129 billion to 74 billion over the same period, according to Ofcom.

312,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/bulls-eye-landing-caps-boeings-faulty-astronaut-capsule-test-mission/,"WASHINGTON: Boeing Co’s Starliner astronaut spacecraft made a “bull’s-eye” landing in the New Mexico desert on Sunday, a successful ending to a crewless test mission that two days earlier failed to reach the orbit needed to dock with the International Space Station.
The 7:58 am ET (1258 GMT) landing at the White Sands desert capped a turbulent 48 hours for Boeing’s botched milestone test of an astronaut capsule that is designed to help NASA regain its human spaceflight capabilities.
A software problem on Friday caused the capsule to fail to attain the orbit needed to rendezvous with the space station, another unwelcome engineering black eye for Boeing in a year that has seen corporate crisis over the grounding of its 737 MAX jetliner following two fatal crashes of the aircraft.

Officials from the aerospace company and NASA breathed sighs of relief following the landing, a highly challenging feat.
“Today it couldn’t really have gone any better,” Boeing space chief executive Jim Chilton told reporters on Sunday, adding that experts would need weeks to analyze the data from this mission before determining if Boeing could move forward with its plan to send a crewed mission on the craft in 2020.
The landing, which tested the capsule’s difficult reentry into the atmosphere and parachute deployment, will yield the mission’s most valuable test data after it failed to meet one of its core objectives of docking to the space station.
“We’re going to get I think a lot more data than we would have gotten if the test had gone according to plan,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said.
After Starliner’s touchdown, teams of engineers in trucks raced to inspect the vehicle, whose six airbags cushioned its impact on the desert surface as planned, a live video feed showed.
The spacecraft was in good condition after landing, Chilton said, with little charring and stable air pressure and temperature in the cabin.
The CST-100 Starliner’s debut launch to orbit was a milestone test for Boeing. The company is vying with SpaceX, the privately held rocket company of billionaire high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, to revive NASA’s human spaceflight capabilities. SpaceX carried out a successful unmanned flight of its Crew Dragon capsule to the space station in March.
After the Starliner capsule was launched from Florida on Friday, an automated timer error prevented it from attaining the right orbit to meet and dock with the space station. Chilton said the timer was running 11 hours ahead, which caused the spacecraft to burn fuel too quickly.

PARACHUTE CHALLENGE
Starliner’s three main parachutes deployed just over one mile (1,600 metres) from the Earth’s surface on Sunday after enduring intense heat from the violent reentry through the atmosphere, plummeting at 25 times the speed of sound.
The parachute deployment, one of the most challenging procedures under the program to develop a commercial manned space capsule, earned Boeing a win after a previous mishap where one parachute failed to deploy during a November test of Starliner’s abort thrusters.
That test tossed the capsule miles into the sky to demonstrate its ability to land a crew safely back on the ground in the event of a launch failure.
For the current mission, Boeing and NASA officials said they still do not understand why software caused the craft to miss the orbit required.
Sunday’s landing marked the first time a US orbital space capsule designed for humans landed on land.
All past US capsules, including SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, splashed down in the ocean. Russia’s Soyuz capsules and China’s past crew capsules made land landings.
The now-retired Space Shuttle used to glide in like a massive plane.

313,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/twitter-facebook-ban-fake-users-some-had-ai-created-photos/,"NEW YORK: Twitter has identified and removed nearly 6,000 accounts that it said were part of a coordinated effort by Saudi government agencies and individuals to advance the country’s geopolitical interests.
Separately, Facebook said it removed hundreds of Facebook accounts, groups and pages linked to inauthentic behaviour from two separate groups, one originating in the country of Georgia and one in  Vietnam, which targeted people both in Vietnam and in the US
Facebook said some of the accounts used profile photos generated by artificial intelligence and masqueraded as Americans. It is one of the first such misinformation efforts to use material generated by AI.
Tech companies have stepped up efforts to tackle misinformation on their services ahead of next year’s US presidential elections. The efforts followed revelations that Russians bankrolled thousands of fake political ads during the 2016 elections to sow dissent among Americans.
Twitter’s and Facebook’s announcements underscore the fact that misinformation concerns aren’t limited to the US and Russia.
In a blog post-Friday, Twitter said the removed Saudi accounts were amplifying messages favourable to Saudi authorities, mainly through “aggressive liking, retweeting and replying.” While the majority of the content was in Arabic, Twitter said the tweets also amplified discussions about sanctions in Iran and appearances by Saudi government officials in Western media.
“Governments have started to launch influence campaigns the same ways commercial enterprises launch campaigns to sell detergent or cars,” said James Ludes, a national defence expert who teaches international relations and public policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.
He said the Russian efforts in 2016 showed it was possible to “actually change public attitudes through the targeted use of social media.”
While the attempts to root out the campaigns may seem like a game of whack-a-mole, he said companies have at least shown progress in taking steps to identify and root out manipulation campaigns run by foreign powers.
Twitter began archiving tweets and media it deems to be associated with known state-backed information operations in 2018. It shut 200,000 Chinese accounts that targeted Hong Kong protests in August.
The 5,929 accounts removed and added to the archives are part of a larger group of 88,000 accounts engaged in “spammy behaviour” across a wide range of topics. But Twitter isn’t disclosing all of them because some might be legitimate accounts taken over through hacking.
The Twitter accounts were linked to a social media marketing firm in Saudi Arabia called Smaat that managed many government departments in Saudi Arabia. The accounts used third-party automated tools to amplify non-political content at high volumes. Twitter said that activity was used to mask the political manoeuvrings of the same accounts.
Samuel Woolley, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies disinformation, said that while the Saudi campaign used basic manipulation techniques, including the use of likes and retweets to give the illusion of popularity, the campaign’s size and scale were unusual. The existence of a thousands-strong army of Saudi accounts also show that social media companies still don’t have a good solution, he said, despite the progress, they have made at identifying state-backed accounts.
“It’s really clear we have to do something about it,” he said. “It can’t just be after the fact. We have to get better about detecting in real-time.”
Messages left with Saudi officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the country’s embassy in Washington was not immediately returned.
The Saudi government has used different tactics to control speech and keep reformers and others from organizing, including employing troll armies to harass and intimidate users online. It has also arrested and imprisoned Twitter users.
In September, Twitter suspended the account of the crown prince’s former top adviser, Saud al-Qahtani, who also served as director of the cybersecurity federation. As with Friday’s announcement, Twitter said that account had violated the company’s platform manipulation policy.
Last month, two former Twitter employees were charged with acting as agents of Saudi Arabia without registering with the US government. The complaint details a coordinated effort by Saudi government officials to recruit employees at the social media giant to look up the private data of Twitter accounts, including email addresses linked to the accounts and internet protocol addresses that can give up a user’s location.
In terms of Facebook’s actions, Facebook said the Georgia group targeted domestic audiences and the Vietnam group focused mainly in the US, as well as Vietnamese-, Spanish- and Chinese-speaking audiences around the world.
The company said they created networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing. To evade detection, they used a combination of fake and real accounts of people in the US to manage pages and groups, the company said.
“We are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we’ve said before, it’s an ongoing challenge,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security policy, said in a blog post.

PARIS: France’s competition authority fined Google 150 million euros ($167 million) for anti-competitive behaviour and for having unclear advertising on the Google Ads page.
The fine comes as France and other European countries maintain high levels of scrutiny on major US tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, which are often criticised for having relatively low tax payments.
In September, Google agreed to pay close to 1 billion euros to French authorities to settle a fiscal fraud probe that began four years ago.
Google, which is the world’s biggest internet search engine, has also faced growing regulatory scrutiny about the content it promotes in search results and ads.
Isabelle de Silva, head of the French competition authority, told news conference that Google’s dominance in the online advertising business was “extraordinary”, with the US company having a market share of around 90% in that field.
Google said it would appeal the fine.
In January, France’s data protection watchdog had fined Google 50 million euros for breaching European Union online privacy rules.
The French watchdog stated in that January ruling that Google lacked transparency and clarity in the way it informed users about its handling of personal data, and had failed to properly obtain their consent for personalised ads.

315,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/scientists-narrow-age-estimate-for-fossils-of-human-ancestor/,"NEW YORK: Scientists say they have finally calculated the age of the youngest known remains of Homo erectus, which is generally considered an ancestor of our species.
The fossilised skull fragments and other bones were uncovered on the Indonesian island of Java in the 1930s. Determining their age has been a scientific challenge, and a wide range has been proposed by numerous studies.


In a report released Wednesday by the journal Nature, scientists conclude the remains are between 108,000 and 117,000 years old. Researchers used five dating techniques on sediments and fossil animal bones from the area, combining 52 age estimates for the analysis. The project took 13 years to complete.
“I don’t see any way to date this site more thoroughly,” said paleoanthropologist Russell Ciochon of the University of Iowa, an author of the study.
H. erectus arose in Africa about 2 million years ago and spread widely there and in Asia, and possibly into Europe. It reached Java more than 1.5 million years ago, and the new dates suggest it died out at least 35,000 years before the arrival there of our own species, Homo sapiens.
H. erectus may have been doomed on Java by climate change that turned its open woodland environment into rain forest, Ciochon said. Still, it evidently existed longer on Earth than any other species on our “Homo” branch of the evolutionary tree.
Susan Anton, a New York University anthropologist who did not participate in the work, called the dating effort “heroic.” But she said she considered the reported age range to be too narrow. She said she preferred a span of less than 550,000 years old to more than 100,000 years old.
That’s roughly what she and co-authors proposed in a paper published in 2011. The younger end of the range in that paper was as recent as 120,000 years, which she said is virtually the same as the new result.

Danish scientists have managed to extract a complete human DNA sample from a piece of birch pitch more than 5,000 years old, used as a kind of chewing gum, a study revealed yesterday.
The Stone-Age sample yielded enough information to determine the source’s sex, what she had last eaten and the germs in her mouth. It also told them she probably had dark hair, dark skin and blue eyes.

And genetically, she was more closely related to hunter-gatherers from the mainland Europe than to those living in central Scandinavia at the time, they concluded.
“It is the first time that an entire ancient human genome has been extracted from anything other than human bones,” Hannes Schroeder of the University of Copenhagen, told AFP.
Schroeder is co-author of the study, which was published in the review Nature Communications.
They found the sample during an archaeological dig at Syltholm, in southern Denmark, said Tehis Jensen, one of the other authors.
“Syltholm is completely unique,” he said.
“Almost everything is sealed in mud, which means that the preservation of organic remains is absolutely phenomenal.”
The researchers also recovered traces of plant and animal DNA — hazelnut and duck — confirming what archaeologists already know about the people who lived there at the time.
But they were not sure why their subject chose to chew the bark: whether to turn it into a kind of glue, to clean her teeth, to stave off hunger — or simply as chewing gum.

In the labs of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a research unit of Columbia University overlooking the Hudson River, the scientists led by Professor Braddock Linsley pore over feet-long coral cores they extracted from far-away reefs.
For Linsley and his colleagues, corals are a precious repository of clues about the past that may help predict future climate trends. They can also reveal how much and how fast environmental conditions have changed during a certain period of time.
Cores are the hard, stony part of a coral underneath the top of the colony – its skeleton. Much like trees, corals produce growth rings that record climatic conditions like seawater temperatures and rainfall as they grow.
In a lab room packed with boxes of coral samples, Linsley and a small team of colleagues cut the cores into slabs and then X-ray the slabs to reveal the annual growth bands.
Using dentist drills, they pulverize small pieces and run geochemical analyses of the coral dust to reconstruct changes in the temperature, salinity and acidity of the water around the coral on a monthly basis going back hundreds of years.
“It is years of lab work and a lot of frustration but once you get to that point, the final product is just so exciting because you’ve got this long dataset,” Linsley said.
Coral reefs develop over thousands of years and are vital to the survival and prosperity of countless marine species. They also curtail flood damage from storms and support human activities like fisheries.
As humans burn more fossil fuel – the biggest contributor to global warming – oceans absorb growing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2).
Some of Linsley’s recent research on corals from the South Pacific island of Tonga suggests that increased seawater acidification caused by excess CO2 could lead to a decline in coral growth rates, endangering the wellbeing of entire reefs.

LOVE AT FIRST CHANCE
Linsley, a tall and soft-spoken 60-year-old, grew up on the Connecticut coast, making dams in the sand and observing erosion on the beaches near the town of Guilford. He loved water and began his career studying ocean sediments and fossils.
His work on corals began after a chance encounter with a colleague who was visiting his girlfriend at the University of New Mexico – where Linsley was studying to get his PhD in the late 1980s – led to a collaboration.
“I was fascinated by the fact that the corals had these annual bands in them and you could potentially extract annual resolve records back several hundred years,” he said at his office in the leafy campus, papers and books scattered on his desk and photos of diving expeditions on the wall.
Corals also brought him closer to the water and he had to learn how to dive, a perk of the job for Linsley.
By studying the environmental records derived from corals, the scientist is hoping to be able to shine a light on issues like the rate of surface ocean warming, ocean acidification and the impact on coral reef ecosystems worldwide.
But one thing is already evident, he said. Environmental changes are happening much more rapidly than in the last several thousand years and they are “clearly linked” to human activity.
Linsley’s childhood home in Connecticut – which he said now regularly battles encroaching waters – stood as a stark reminder.
“My children are 11 and 13. I think about in 50 years from now when I’m not here, what’s it going to be like,” he said.

318,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/remote-island-off-east-timor-turns-sunlight-air-into-drinking-water/,"KUALA LUMPUR: Villagers on a tiny island off the coast of East Timor who have long struggled with water shortages have secured regular fresh supplies, using just air and the power of the sun.
The innovative scheme uses solar power to suck water out of the air and make it drinkable, with the aim of reducing plastic waste and providing the small community on the wildlife-rich island of Atauro with a renewable supply of drinking water.
“The people living on Atauro have not had the opportunity to drink clean water that is not packaged in plastic,” said Rob Bartrop, chief revenue officer at Zero Mass Water the US technology firm behind the scheme.
“For the first time … they have a renewable source of water they can rely on,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Population growth and climate change are putting increasingly intense pressure on the planet’s limited water supplies, with worsening shortages emerging from the Middle East to Asia and Latin America, researchers said last month.
Like many similar islands in the region, Atauro lacks water infrastructure, leaving its 10,000 inhabitants reliant on rainwater and bottled supplies shipped in to meet their needs.
The new project, run with the US non-profit Conservation International, began operating in June and uses a material to absorb or suck water out of the air which is then turned into clean water.
In addition to reducing Atauro’s plastic water bottle waste, the project produces 12,000 litres of drinking water per month.
Zero Mass Water’s technology is now being used in schools, homes and businesses more than 35 countries, but the Atauro project is one of the first to be designed to serve an entire community’s drinking needs.
“We hope that there is a lot of scope to replicate and expand in surrounding parts of the region,” said Bartrop.

319,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/holidays-bring-phishing-scam-surge-aimed-at-small-business/,"NEW YORK: The email looked legitimate, so Danielle Radin clicked on the link it contained, expecting to have her products included in a holiday gift guide.
“I instantly regretted it,” says Radin, owner of Mantra Magnets, a website that sells wellness products. “It took me to some random website that looked like those pop-ups telling you that you’ve won the lottery.”
Within days of that click three weeks ago, Radin began getting notifications that people in Ecuador, China and elsewhere were trying to access her email account. She wasn’t surprised; she knew her San Diego-based small business had been the target of a phishing scam.
While cybercriminals strike at any time of the year, they’re particularly active during the holiday and income tax filing seasons when computer users expect to see more emails — and scammers are increasingly targeting individual small businesses with phishing scams, sending messages that look legitimate but do harm instead. An unsuspecting owner or employee clicks on a link or attachment and like Radin finds that malicious software has invaded their PCs.
Cybersecurity experts find that criminals who used to blanket thousands of computer users in hopes of fooling a handful have refined their methods. Scammers find small businesses through websites, social media sites and by combing email address books. They also mine personal data from breaches at retailers and other large companies. Then, using a process called social engineering, they construct emails that increasingly look realistic, as if they truly come from a boss, colleague, friend, potential client or vendor, a bank and even the IRS.
“In the last year or two they’ve been running more professional campaigns,” says Perry Toone, owner of Thexyz, an email service provider based in Toronto. “It can take a couple of minutes for me to determine that they’re phishing scams. That tells me they’re doing a very good job.”
Radin believes the scammers found her through her website or a blog. Like many small businesses, she has an email address on her site, and the scammers figured out that she might be interested in selling via a holiday gift guide. But finding a target is one thing; the scam won’t work unless it tricks an email recipient into clicking. Even those who are tech savvy can sometimes let their guard down. Radin was duped even though she’s the author of “Everyone’s Been Hacked,” a book sold online.
Often a scam succeeds because there’s just a shred of doubt in a computer user — the email is realistic enough that an owner or employee feels they need to read it. Sometimes a staffer clicks out of fear or a sense of responsibility, says Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College.
“It might not sound very personal, but you have an idea that you should go ahead — you feel like the email is coming from the boss,” he says.
Computer users may not be looking as closely as they should at an email — there can be subtle signs that a message is trouble. Terry Cole, owner of Cole Informatics, a company whose work includes cybersecurity, recalls getting an email that truly seemed to be from a colleague. He was one of several people in the industry to receive it.
“It said that this colleague had sent me a secure private message that was ready for me to read and included a link to click. This was absolutely consistent with my normal experiences communicating with him,” says Cole, whose company is located in Parsons, Tennessee.
Cole didn’t do in that instance what he usually does and advises everyone to do: check the email address to be sure it’s completely correct. When he clicked on the link, it took him to a bogus website claiming to be connected with Microsoft and asking him for his ID and password. He went no further and suffered no damage to his PC.
The holidays provide scammers with extra opportunities: emailed greeting cards, package shipment notices, offers of discounts — all of them false. Cybercriminals also seek personal information from owners and employees under the guise of needing them to create a W-2 or 1099 tax form; at this time of year, business owners’ thoughts are turning to taxes.
“Something that claims to know you, your name, where you work and wants you to take some action is harder to spot,” says Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company based in Sunnyvale, California.
A common scam at holiday time is an email purportedly from the boss telling a staffer to go buy gift cards and email the numbers back, DeGrippo says.
“When it appears to come from a boss or CEO, I think there is that tendency among employees to follow those directions. They’re playing on their emotions,” she says.
Often, a scam succeeds in getting an employee to click on a personal email while on a company PC — many workers check their personal email while at work. Even though the email came through on a personal message, it’s the company’s machine that can be infected.
Companies can protect themselves in part by restricting employees’ access to personal email sites, Telang says. He also suggests seminars to help staffers understand the risks that even legitimate-looking emails can present.
Some of the scams aim at monitoring a user’s keystrokes. So anyone accessing a company or personal account of any sort can be giving a criminal access to their money or sensitive personal data. One tool to prevent a bank account from being emptied or a credit card maxed out is to have accounts with multifactor authentication; that requires a password and a separate code sent to a different device and that is different for each login.

320,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-co-founders-step-aside-as-pichai-takes-helm-of-parent-alphabet/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google co–founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping aside as leaders of the Internet behemoth they founded 21 years ago, ending an extraordinary run that saw them build one of the world’s most valuable and influential companies.
Trusted lieutenant Sundar Pichai, who has run the core Google search business since 2015, will immediately take the reins as CEO of parent Alphabet Inc.
“While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it’s time to assume the role of proud parents — offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!” Page and Brin wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.
Page, Brin and Pichai have shared an emphasis on developing artificial intelligence software to make web searching faster and more personalised, while expanding the range of information and services available from a simple text query.
But their vision faces unprecedented scrutiny, with governments on five continents demanding better safeguards, an end to what many view as anticompetitive conduct, and more taxes from the world’s largest online advertising company. Thousands of employees have protested, and some have even resigned, over ongoing concern that Google‘s famous “don’t be evil” mantra – once embraced by Page and Brin – may be cracking.
Streamlining Alphabet‘s unorthodox management structure could help the company better respond to the challenges and focus on growing profits, investors said.
“This signals a shift away from the more fringy efforts … and more towards a company focused on technology that makes money,” said Kim Caughey Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
Alphabet, which owns more than a dozen companies including self-driving car business Waymo and health care software company Verily, was created in 2015 as part of a restructuring. The Google unit retained control of major businesses including video giant YouTube, the Android smartphone software and hardware operations, and cloud computing.
Page had wanted to focus on developing the newer businesses, which collectively lose money. He left Google, by far the biggest and most profitable part of Alphabet, to Pichai, who in turn delegates a lot of authority to deputies who manage the various product lines. Brin had stayed on as Alphabet‘s president, spending time on robotics, health ventures and other research projects.
But Page and Brin, once regular sights at public events and at Google headquarters, had become much less visible in recent years. Page’s retreat into the background drew increasing criticism from employees and US lawmakers, who demanded answers from him rather than Pichai about controversial projects such as an experimental search app for Chinese users.
Page and Brin, both 46, remain directors of the parent company but will cede their respective CEO and president titles immediately, Alphabet said. The president role will not be filled, it said, describing the changes as long discussed.
Page’s voice has been impaired for years because of a chronic condition, but his health did not play a role in the decision to step aside, Alphabet said.
“With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it’s the natural time to simplify our management structure,” the co–founders said. “We are deeply committed to Google and Alphabet for the long term.”
The co–founders still control the company through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26.1% of Alphabet‘s total voting power, Brin 25.25% and Pichai less than 1%. Alphabet shares rose 0.56% following the after-hours announcement to $1,302.
‘MOONSHOTS’ AND REGULATORS
Page and Brin developed the core Google search technology while they were still graduate students at Stanford, and it quickly proved far superior to competing search engines of the early Internet era.
By the time it went public in 2004, Google dominated Web search and was on its way to becoming a household name and the most powerful force in the global advertising business. The young co–founders also nurtured a free-wheeling, engineering-driven culture that became a model in Silicon Valley, which is littered with startups launched by Google veterans.
Pichai, 47, who has spent 15 years at Google, rose to prominence while leading the development of Google‘s Chrome browser. He later led product development and engineering across all of Google‘s services for a year before gaining the CEO title.
Page and Brin are active in a range of non-Google ventures. Page funded a company attempting to develop flying cars, and Brin at a conference last year discussed a budding interest in cryptocurrency. The Alphabet structure was designed in part to let them pursue new “moonshot” projects.
Investors and regulators, however, were never completely sold.
Alphabet had used the separation between Page’s and Pichai‘s roles to defend its limited financial disclosures about YouTube and other large Google businesses when the practice was questioned by US securities regulators in 2017.
It contended that publicly reported financial results were in line with what Page reviewed as Alphabet CEO. Regulators did not take further action, but the company’s stance has frustrated investors trying to evaluate its performance.
Alphabet declined to comment on whether public financial reporting would change with Pichai assuming both CEO positions.

321,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/for-babies-born-with-hiv-start-treatment-right-away-study/,"WASHINGTON: When babies are born with HIV, starting treatment within hours to days is better than waiting even the few weeks to months that’s the norm in many countries, researchers reported Wednesday.
The findings, from a small but unique study in Botswana, could influence care in Africa and other regions hit hard by the virus. They also might offer a clue in scientists’ quest for a cure.
The Harvard-led team found super early treatment limits how HIV takes root in a newborn’s body, shrinking the “reservoir” of virus that hides out, ready to rebound if those youngsters ever stop their medications.
“We don’t think the current intervention is itself curative, but it sets the stage” for future attempts, said Dr Daniel Kuritzkes of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who co-authored the study.
Giving pregnant women a cocktail of anti-HIV drugs can prevent them from spreading the virus to their unborn children, a step that has dramatically reduced the number of babies born with the virus worldwide. Still, some 300 to 500 infants are estimated to be infected every day in sub-Saharan Africa.
Doctors have long known that treating babies in the first weeks to months of life is important, because their developing immune systems are especially vulnerable to HIV. But an infant dubbed the “Mississippi baby” raised a critical question: Should treatment start even earlier? The girl received a three-drug combination within 30 hours of her birth in July 2010, highly unusual for the time. Her family quit treatment when she was a toddler — yet her HIV remained in remission for a remarkable 27 months before she relapsed and restarted therapy.
The Botswana study was one of several funded by the US National Institutes of Health after doctors learned of the Mississippi baby, to further explore very early treatment.
The findings are encouraging, said Dr Deborah Persaud, a pediatric HIV specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the Botswana study but helped evaluate the Mississippi baby.
“The study showed what we hypothesized happened in the Mississippi baby, that very early treatment really prevents establishment of these long-lived reservoir cells that currently are the barrier to HIV eradication,” Persaud said.
She cautioned: “Very early treatment is important, but prevention should still be our top priority.”
In Botswana, researchers tested at-risk newborns, enrolling 40 born with HIV, treating them within hours to a few days, and tracking them for two years. On Wednesday, they reported results from the first 10 patients, comparing them with 10 infants getting regular care — treatment beginning when they were a few months old.
Medication brought HIV under control in both groups. But the children treated earliest had a much smaller reservoir of HIV in their blood, starting about six months into treatment, the researchers reported in Science Translational Medicine.
The earliest-treated children also got another benefit: more normal functioning of some key parts of the immune system.
One big question: Did the HIV reservoir shrink enough to make a long-term difference? To find out, next year the researchers will give these children experimental antibodies designed to help keep HIV in check, and test how they fare with a temporary stop to their anti-HIV drugs.
In the US, Europe and South Africa, it’s becoming common to test at-risk infants at birth. But in most lower-income countries, babies aren’t tested until they’re 4 to 6 weeks old, said study co-author Dr. Roger Shapiro, a Harvard infectious disease specialist.

322,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/web-inventor-has-an-ambitious-plan-to-take-back-the-net/,"World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee released an ambitious rule book for online governance — a bill of rights and obligations for the internet — designed to counteract the growing prevalence of such anti-democratic poisons as misinformation, mass surveillance and censorship.
The product of a year’s work by the World Wide Web Foundation where Berners-Lee is a founding director, the “ Contract for the Web ” seeks commitments from governments and industry to make and keep knowledge freely available — a digital policy agenda true to the design vision of the 30-year-old web.
The contract is non-binding, however. And funders and partners in the endeavour include Google and Facebook, whose data-collecting business models and sensation-rewarding algorithms have been blamed for exacerbating online toxicity.
“We haven’t had a fairly complex, fairly complete plan of action for the web going forward,” Berners-Lee said in an interview. “This is the first time we’ve had a rule book in which responsibility is being shared.”
For instance, the contract proposes a framework for protecting online privacy and personal data with clearly defined national laws that give individuals greater control over the data collected about them. Independent, well-resourced regulators would offer the public effective means for redress. Current laws and institutions don’t measure up to that standard.
Amnesty International just released a report charging that Google and Facebook’s business models are predicated on the abuse of human rights.
Berners-Lee nevertheless says that “having them in the room is really important.” He said both companies had approached the foundation seeking participation.
“We feel that companies and governments deserve equal seats at the table and understanding where they’re coming from is equally valuable,” he said. “To have this conversation around a table without the tech companies, it just wouldn’t have the clout and we wouldn’t have ended up with the insights.”
The nonprofit foundation’s top donors include the Swedish, Canadian and US governments and the Ford and Omidyar foundations.
One of its biggest challenges is the growing balkanization of the internet, with national governments led by China, Russia and Iran exerting increasing technical control over their domestic networks, tightening censorship and surveillance.
“The trend for balkanization is really worrying and it’s extreme at the moment in Iran,” said Berners-Lee. A strong government exhibits tolerance, the computer scientist added, for “other voices, opposition voices, foreign voices to be heard by its citizens.”
So how to prevent governments from restricting internet access at their borders?
One approach, said Berners-Lee, could be financial pressure. Multinational lenders could condition lower interest rates, for example, on a nation’s willingness to let information flow freely on its domestic network.

323,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-reins-in-political-advertising/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google is making it harder for political advertisers to target specific types of people.
The company said that as of January, advertisers will only be able to target US political ads based on broad categories such as gender, age and postal code. Currently, ads can be tailored for more specific groups — for instance, using information gleaned from public voter logs, such as political affiliation.
The change will take effect in the UK in the next week, before the general election, and in the European Union before the end of 2019. It will apply everywhere else in early January.
Google reiterated that ads making false claims are prohibited, adding that so-called deepfakes — realistic but false video clips — are not allowed. Neither are “demonstrably false” claims that could affect voter trust in an election.
But in a blog post announcing the news, Google Ads vice president Scott Spencer noted that political dialogue is important and “no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim and insinuation.”
“So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited — but we will continue to do so for clear violations,” he wrote.
Like all Google ads, political advertisers can also use the broader practice of “contextual targeting,” which involves placing ads about, say, climate change on articles about the environment.
The company is also requiring advertiser verification for a broader range of political messages. Previously, only ads mentioning candidates or officeholders for federal positions required verification. Now that will also include ads touching on state officials and candidates as well as ballot measures.
The move follows Twitter’s ban on political ads, which goes into effect on Friday.
Twitter also placed restrictions on ads related to social causes such as climate change or abortion.
In these instances, advertisers won’t be able to target those ads down to a user’s ZIP code or use political categories such as “conservative” or “liberal.” Rather, targeting must be kept broad, based on a user’s state or province, for instance.
Facebook has not made sweeping changes to any of its ads policies, but thrust the issue into public discussion this fall when it confirmed it would not remove false or misleading ads by politicians.
Critics have harshly condemned Facebook’s decision. Twitter also faced a backlash from those who found its ban too far-reaching.
Google has taken a more middling stance, but it’s unlikely to please everyone. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s campaign staff took issue with reports that Facebook might consider limiting its targeting practices.
“Facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020,” the campaign tweeted from its official account. “Tools that help us reach more great Americans & lift voices the media & big tech choose to ignore!”
Even Google’s limited targeting could receive backlash.
Critics and civil rights groups have said targeting specific zip codes or other small geographic zones can allow advertisers to discriminate or sway elections.
The expansion to Google’s verification process will take effect December 3.

324,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/amazon-says-its-considered-face-scanning-in-ring-doorbells/,"Amazon has considered adding facial recognition technology to its Ring doorbell cameras, according to a letter to a US senator defending its video-sharing partnerships with police.
The company told Senator Ed Markey that facial recognition is a “contemplated, but unreleased feature” of its home security cameras but that there are no plans to coordinate that feature with its law enforcement partnerships.
Markey wrote to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in September raising privacy and civil liberty concerns about Ring’s video-sharing agreements with police departments across the country. The company encourages police to tap into Ring’s Neighbors app, a forum for residents to share videos of suspicious activity captured by their home security cameras.

The Massachusetts Democrat also expressed alarm that Ring may be pursuing face-scanning technology after a patent application showed the company is exploring a system that could flag certain people as suspicious and automatically alert police.
Markey released Amazon’s responses Tuesday.
Amazon’s initial response to Markey said Ring doesn’t currently offer facial recognition. Then Markey sent another letter to Bezos asking why it’s mentioned in Ring’s privacy policy. In a Nov. 1 follow-up, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, Brian Huseman, said that the company frequently innovates based on customer demand and that facial recognition is an increasingly common feature in cameras made by competitors such as Google’s Nest division.
“If our customers want these features in Ring security cameras, we will only release these features with thoughtful design including privacy, security, and user control,” Huseman wrote.
Markey’s questions about facial recognition were part of broader concerns that some lawmakers and civil liberties advocates have about Ring and its police partnerships. Amazon sought to address those concerns in its letters to Markey, emphasizing that camera owners have a choice about whether to share videos. The company noted that police aren’t allowed to seek recordings that are longer than 12 hours in duration or that cover a geographical area that is too specific or broad.
But Amazon also said it doesn’t require law enforcement to delete a user’s video footage after a certain period. Nor would it entertain Markey’s request that it commit to never selling users’ biometric information, saying only that it doesn’t do so now.
Markey said Tuesday that Amazon is not doing enough to ensure that its products don’t run afoul of civil liberties.
“Connected doorbells are well on their way to becoming a mainstay of American households, and the lack of privacy and civil rights protections for innocent residents is nothing short of chilling,” he said in a statement.
“If you’re an adult walking your dog or a child playing on the sidewalk, you shouldn’t have to worry that Ring’s products are amassing footage of you and that law enforcement may hold that footage indefinitely or share that footage with any third parties,” he added.
More than 600 police departments have signed up to Ring’s network since last year and many say it is becoming a useful crime-fighting tool. Among them is the police chief of Markey’s hometown of Malden, Massachusetts. Chief Kevin Molis said he is Markey’s neighbor and has known him since the 1970s but disagrees with him about Ring.
“We consider it a valuable tool for public safety,” Molis said in an interview. “Is it a bad thing that private citizens, in order to make their streets safer, are investing their own money in a product that’s allowing crimes to be solved and crimes to be prevented?”
But staff attorney Mohammad Tajsar of the ACLU of Southern California said Amazon’s responses to Markey raise grave privacy concerns. Amazon told Markey it has no way of knowing if its cameras are collecting personal data from children or positioned in such a way that they’re intruding on a neighbor’s privacy.
“Even if you don’t sell data, or provide data to law enforcement, you’re creating a mechanism whereby people can express latent biases and racism and classism in a portal that encourages it,” Tajsar said.

325,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/china-tests-mars-lander-in-international-cooperation-push/,"HUAILAI: China invited international observers to a Thursday test of its Mars lander as it pushes for inclusion in more global space projects.
The demonstration of hovering, obstacle avoidance and deceleration capabilities was conducted at a site outside Beijing simulating conditions on the Red Planet, where the pull of gravity is about one-third that of Earth.
China plans to launch a lander and rover to Mars next year to explore parts of the planet in detail.
China’s burgeoning space program achieved a lunar milestone earlier this year by landing a probe on the mysterious far side of the moon.

It has developed rapidly, especially since it conducted its first crewed mission in 2003 and has sought cooperation with space agencies from Europe and elsewhere.
The US, however, has banned most space cooperation with China out of national security concerns, keeping China from participating in the International Space Station.
Despite that, China’s ambitions continue to grow as it seeks to rival the US, Russia and Europe in space and cement its position as a regional and global power.
Guests at Thursday’s event came from 19 countries and included the ambassadors of Brazil, France and Italy.
“This event is the first public appearance of China’s Mars exploration mission, also an important measure for China to pragmatically carry out space international exchanges and cooperation,” the China National Space Administration said in a news release.

326,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/should-people-be-paid-for-sharing-their-personal-data-online/,"
LONDON: From tagging photos on Facebook to driving with Google Maps, people should join forces in “data unions” to demand payment for letting online tools collect their data, according to an economist advocating for radical reforms to improve society.
Glen Weyl, a principal researcher at the research arm of US tech giant Microsoft, said people have been “fooled” into handing over data that is then used in artificial intelligence (AI) to copy human behaviour and possibly eliminate some jobs.
“Humans are doing all this work and then we are being told that we are doing nothing, that we play no role, and that these systems are just going to automate us away. This is profoundly dishonest,” Weyl told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“We need to respect the fact that those data are actually being created by the very people who these companies are claiming are no longer relevant. And we need to acknowledge that by compensating them.”
While getting paid for tagging photos on Instagram or uploading to YouTube might sound way off, the idea has been gaining some traction in the United States as tech giants from Google, to Facebook and Twitter, face increased scrutiny over the way they handle personal information.
Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang has said people should receive a share of the economic value generated from their data, while the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, recently proposed companies should pay a “data dividend”.
Weyl said the amount people would get is a matter of debate but it would, in general, depend on the size of the economy that becomes automated, with people getting more money the more jobs are taken over by artificial intelligence thanks to their data.
Estimates vary from $500 a year in a present-day scenario, to $20,000 some 15 years down the line, when some projections say a third of all jobs will be done by computers, he said.
Yet, single users are unlikely to get a penny unless they organise in “data unions” similarly to what workers did during the industrial revolution, said Weyl, a speaker at the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s annual Trust Conference on Thursday.
“People get paid for completing surveys, or putting television boxes in their home that monitor how they watch television,” he said.
“The problem is that the ability of people to receive reasonable and fair compensation for what they do online is undermined by the fact that all these other people are consenting to do it for free.”
Unions could bring together users with specific sets of data, like on travel or shopping habits, and bargain a better price for it, said Weyl, who co-authored the 2018 book “Radical Markets” with legal scholar Eric Posner.
They could also help address privacy concerns by restricting what information is collected and how it is used, he added.
Some early versions of data unions already exist.
US start-up Datacoup offers users a platform to monetise their data, while Dutch group ‘Datavakbond’, or “data labour union”, was set up in 2018 with the aim of negotiating directly with Facebook and Google over data use.
But Weyl said more people needed to get involved or become vocal about the need for a more equitable system otherwise things could slide in the opposite direction, with a few powerful companies and central states controlling most data.
“We can build alternatives to the worst scenarios but those alternatives are not going to come unless we do it together,” he said.

That means “sky” in the language of the Native American Powhatan people, NASA said Tuesday.

NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew past the snowman-shaped Arrokoth on New Year’s Day, 3 ½ years after exploring Pluto. At the time, this small icy world 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometres) beyond Pluto was nicknamed Ultima Thule given its vast distance from us.
“The name ‘Arrokoth’ reflects the inspiration of looking to the skies,” lead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said in a statement, “and wondering about the stars and worlds beyond our own.”
The name was picked because of the Powhatan’s ties to the Chesapeake Bay region.
New Horizons is operated from Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland. The Hubble Space Telescope — which discovered Arrokoth in 2014 — has its science operations in Baltimore.
The New Horizons team got consent for the name from Powhatan Tribal elders and representatives, according to NASA. The International Astronomical Union and its Minor Planet Center approved the choice.
Arrokoth is among countless objects in the so-called Kuiper Belt, or vast Twilight Zone beyond the orbit of Neptune. New Horizons will observe some of these objects from afar as it makes it’s way deeper into space.

Stargazers used solar-filtered binoculars and telescopes to spot Mercury — a tiny black dot — as it passed directly between Earth and the sun on Monday.
The eastern US and Canada got the whole 5 ½-hour show, weather permitting, along with Central and South America. The rest of the world, except for Asia and Australia, got just a sampling.

Mercury is the solar system’s smallest, innermost planet. The next transit isn’t until 2032, and North America won’t get another shot until 2049.
In Maryland, clouds prevented NASA solar astrophysicist Alex Young from getting a clear peek. Live coverage was provided by observatories including NASA’s orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory.
“It’s a bummer, but the whole event was still great,” Young wrote in an email. “Both getting to see it from space and sharing it with people all over the country and world.”
At Cape Canaveral, space buffs got a two-for-one. As Mercury’s silhouette graced the morning sun, SpaceX launched 60 small satellites for global internet service, part of the company’s growing Starlink constellation in orbit.

330,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/one-big-step-google-buys-fitbit-for-2-1-billion/,"Google, the company that helped make it fun to just sit around surfing the web, is jumping into the fitness-tracker business with both feet, buying Fitbit for about $2.1 billion.
The deal could put Google in direct competition with Apple and Samsung in the highly competitive market for smartwatches and other wearable electronics. But it also raises questions about privacy and Google’s dominance in the tech industry.

The company’s announcement Friday came with a promise that it won’t sell ads using the intimate health data that Fitbit devices collect.
Fitbit is a pioneer in wearable fitness technology, making a range of devices that have become pop-culture accessories, from basic trackers that count how many steps you take each day to smartwatches that display messages and notifications from phones.
They can track activities such as running, cycling and swimming and record heart rates and sleep patterns. Fitbit typically asks for date of birth, gender, height and weight to help with such things as estimating calories burned. Some people use Fitbit’s app to record what they eat and how much water they drink. Women can track their periods.
Fitbit has 28 million active users worldwide and has sold more than 100 million devices.
Google, meanwhile, makes software for use in other manufacturers’ wearable devices, but those products haven’t gained much traction in the face of competition from Fitbit, Apple, Samsung and others. And Google doesn’t sell a device of its own.
The deal to buy Fitbit could give Google a needed boost.
“Google doesn’t want to be left out of the party,” said analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. “If you look at what Apple has done with wearables, it’s a missing piece of the puzzle for Google.”
Google’s pledge that it won’t sell ads using Fitbit health data is a continuation of promises previously made by Fitbit.
Privacy experts, though, were sceptical.
Consumer Reports health privacy expert Dena Mendelsohn said she is concerned that people enrolled in wellness programs through their employers that use Fitbit devices could lose control over their data.
“While a person may not have had concerns about Fitbit holding their data, they may have concerns over Google holding their data,” Mendelsohn said.
Google’s promise is also unlikely to stop it from gathering other information from Fitbit devices.
For example, Fitbit has GPS models that could track users’ locations. That could help Google know that a runner stopped at a coffee shop on the way home. Google could then display ads for rival coffee shops.
More important, having a Google device on the wrist could drive wearers to use Google services, even more, giving the company more ways to sell ads.
The deal is likely to face scrutiny from state and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust authorities, who are already investigating Google and other big tech companies over whether they have abused their market power.
“Why should Google be permitted to acquire even more companies while they’re under DOJ antitrust investigation?” Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, tweeted.
Still, analysts at equity research firm Cowen said they believe regulators are unlikely to block the deal because of Fitbit’s relatively small size and its focus on hardware.
While Fitbit all but created the field, it has been shredded by the competition. It was worth nearly $10 billion after it went public in 2015. But its value this week is well below $2 billion.
When rumours of a potential buyout by Google surfaced earlier this week, Fitbit stock soared almost 30%. It jumped nearly 16% more Friday.
Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet, will pay $7.35 per share. Alphabet stock gained about 1%.
“With Google’s resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone,” Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park said in a statement.
Fitbit has been expanding its partnerships with major health care companies such as Humana to encourage healthier living.
John Hancock announced incentives last year on its insurance policies for people willing to share data gathered by health-monitoring devices. It offers free Fitbits to participants.
Last year, Fitbit acquired a health coaching business that helps people manage conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.
Fitbit ranks fourth in global shipments of digital watches, fitness trackers and other wrist-worn devices, according to research firm IDC. Chinese companies Xiaomi and Huawei were No. 1 and No. 3, Apple was No. 2, and Samsung came in fifth.

Event organisers say their selection of Dubai as host reflects a vote of confidence that this oil-rich Emirati sheikhdom can be a global hub for innovation. They also expressed hope that bringing together tomorrow’s scientists and engineers will help develop technologies to solve the world’s most pressing issues, particularly those related to the environment.
Dean Kamen, founder of first Global Challenge, said the Middle East represents a part of the world where “the adults have not learned how to play nice with each other” and it was up to young people to fix humanity’s self-inflicted wounds.
“We are in an accelerating race toward catastrophe, whether it’s global warning, melting of the (polar ice) caps, bird flu, terrorism — you name it, we’re worried about it. The solution to most of the world’s grand challenges depends on better technologies than we have today,” he said.
“This globe of ours is on life support, so the thought is we get every kid in every country to focus on learning how to use technology, but focus on using it as a tool and not a weapon,” he explained.
The unofficial “Robotics Olympics” seeks to encourage young people to pursue subjects known as STEM — science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Teams of four to five students, aged 14-18, each received a kit of rods, wheels, wires and other raw materials with which to assemble their roving robots. Their task: Collect orange balls of various sizes from a playing field, which represented human-created pollutants in the ocean. Some devised robots for scooping, while others snatched up and fired the balls through the air into the receptacles.
The teams then formed “alliances,” each with up of four nations, to battle their way to the final round. Overall, 1,500 students took part.
A team captained by Belarus, and including Syrian refugees, eventually won the gold medal, edging out a team captained by Israel in a dramatic final match. But organisers stressed a message of unity, not conflict.
“The kids get it. To them this isn’t a competition; this is a ‘coop-etition.’ This is a celebration of technology,” said Kamen.
Previous events tackled challenges related to clean water access and sustainable energy.
Robotics is a natural fit for Dubai, a city that’s already testing driverless cars and taxis. It’s become a magnet for international entrepreneurs, with an entire zone called “Internet City” that’s packed with high-tech startups. Next October, Dubai will host the Expo 2020, welcoming technological breakthroughs from around the world.
“If we are to become the city of the future, we need to have the right talent from around the world,” said Omar Al-Olama, the 29-year-old Emirati Minister of Artificial Intelligence, the world’s first such minister. “Artificial intelligence is based on data. Data is what drives all these new technologies. We have the holy grail of data. We have 200 nationalities represented in this country.”
FedEx recently announced Dubai would become the first city outside the US to test Roxo, an autonomous delivery device that can travel on sidewalks and even unpaved surfaces.
Roxo made its debut international appearance at this week’s robotics contest, drawing the interest of the tech-savvy teens hailing from places as diverse as Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. They mingled in Dubai’s Festival City, exchanging experiences and forming friendships while talking shop about their gadgets.
“We didn’t do so well in the matches because we had a lot of trouble with the control hub, but it doesn’t matter, we had a lot of fun,” said Stefan Sijbesma, 17, from the Netherlands. “For me, robotics is really important because it really helped me choose what I want to study and what I want to do with my life.”
The three-day tournament had a festival-like atmosphere to it, with announcers and commentators analysing the action in sports-broadcast style and fans waving flags and banners supporting their teams. The pavilion floor was filled with facts about the millions of tons of pollutants threatening the world’s oceans, and featured slogans such as “united by land, connected by oceans” and “together we turn the tide on pollution.”
As the nail-biting results were being announced, the Israelis huddled with their Ugandan teammates before embracing the winning team in a feel-good ending.
“I can’t believe it, it’s a miracle,” said Yamen Najjar, manager of Team Hope, which represents the Syrian refugees and was part of the winning alliance. “It was a very difficult competition for us, we faced a lot of problems, but we didn’t lose hope.”
Outgoing US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who’d made the original announcement that Dubai would host the event earlier this year in a surprise visit to the World Government Summit, was on hand. Perry said he’s followed the robotics tournaments since 2002 when, as governor of Texas, he attended one of the regional competitions in Houston and was “blown away” by the passions and abilities of the young contestants.
But he said he found their camaraderie even more impressive.
“It is stunning what these young people are doing,” Perry said. “Where the adults may have failed in the standpoint of international diplomacy, these young people may accomplish, and if that’s the case maybe that is the most important thing that comes out of this.”

The 25-year-old university dropout Boyan Slat founded The Ocean Cleanup to develop and deploy a system he invented when he was 18 that catches plastic waste floating in the ocean.
On Saturday he unveiled the next step in his fight: A floating solar-powered device that he calls the “Interceptor” that scoops plastic out of rivers as it drifts past.
“We need to close the tap, which means preventing more plastic from reaching the ocean in the first place,” he said, calling rivers “the arteries that carry the trash from land to sea.”
Slat’s organisation has in the past drawn criticism for focusing only on the plastic trash already floating in the world’s oceans. Experts say 9 million tons (8 million metric tons) of plastic waste, including plastic bottles, bags, toys and other items, flows annually into the ocean from beaches, rivers and creeks, endangering marine life in the oceans, including whales.
Three of the machines have already been deployed to Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam — and a fourth is heading to the Dominican Republic, he said.
Izham Hashim from the government of Selangor state in Malaysia was present at the launch and said he was happy with the machine.
“It has been used for 1 1/2 months in the river and it’s doing very well, collecting the plastic bottles and all the rubbish,” he said.
Slat said he believes 1,000 rivers are responsible for some 80% of plastic pouring into the world’s oceans and he wants to tackle them all in the next five years.
“This is not going to be easy, but imagine if we do get this done,” he told his audience of enthusiastic supporters, who whooped, clapped and cheered his announcements. “We could truly make our oceans clean again.”
Slat used his live-streamed unveiling to appeal for support from countries committing to clean up their rivers and businesses prepared to inject funding and help with the operation of the devices.
The vessel is designed to be moored in rivers and has a shaped nose to deflect away larger floating debris like tree trunks. The interceptors work by guiding plastic waste into an opening in its bow, a conveyor belt then carries the trash into the guts of the machine where it is dropped into dumpsters. The interceptor sends a text message to local operators that can come and empty it when it’s full.
Slat showed off how it worked by dumping hundreds of yellow rubber ducks into the water at the launch event in Rotterdam’s port. The interceptor caught nearly all of them.
The machines currently cost about 700,000 euros ($775,600), but Slat said the cost will likely drop as production increases.
Jan van Franeker of the Wageningen Marine Research Institute has been critical of The Ocean Cleanup in the past, but said the new device looks promising.
“I am really happy they finally moved toward the source of the litter,” he said in a telephone interview. “The design, from what I can see, looks pretty good.”
Slat argued that the economic impact of not picking plastic out of rivers is higher than the cost of buying and using the machines.
“Deploying interceptors is even cheaper than deploying nothing at all,” he said.

333,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-plans-to-send-water-hunting-robot-to-moon-surface-in-2022/,"WASHINGTON: NASA will send a golf cart-sized robot to the moon in 2022 to search for deposits of water below the surface, an effort to evaluate the vital resource ahead of a planned human return to the moon in 2024 to possibly use it for astronauts to drink and to make rocket fuel, the US space agency said on Friday.
The VIPER robot will drive for miles (km) on the dusty lunar surface to get a closer look at what NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine has touted for months: underground pockets of “hundreds of millions of tons of water ice” that could help turn the moon into a jumping-off point to Mars.
“VIPER is going to assess where the water ice is. We’re going to be able to characterize the water ice, and ultimately drill,” Bridenstine said on Friday at the International Astronautical Congress in Washington. “Why is this important? Because water ice represents something significant. Life support.”
VIPER stands for Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover.
The rover is expected to arrive on the moon‘s south polar region in December 2022, carrying four instruments to sample lunar soil for traces of hydrogen and oxygen – the basic components of water that can be separated and synthesized into fuel for a planned fleet of commercial lunar launch vehicles.
In development at NASA‘s Ames Research Center in California, the VIPER robot will log “about 100 days of data that will be used to inform the first global water resource maps of the moon,” NASA said in announcing the plans.
NASA is in the process of kickstarting its Artemis program, an accelerated mission to put people back on the moon for the first time since the 1970s to train and prove technologies that would later be sent on a Mars mission.
Scientists have eyed lunar water as a key resource for enabling long-duration astronaut missions on the moon, though its form and exact amount are unknown. VIPER will aim to find out.
NASA crashed a rocket onto the moon‘s south pole in 2009 to confirm traces of lunar water ice in the plume of dust kicked up upon impact.

334,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/facebook-launches-a-news-section/,"
Over the course of its 15 year history, Facebook has variously ignored news organisations while eating their advertising revenue, courted them for video projects it subsequently abandoned, and then largely cut their stories out of its newsfeeds.
Now it plans to pay them for news headlines — reportedly millions of dollars in some cases.
Enter the “News Tab,” a new section in the Facebook mobile app that will display headlines — and nothing else — from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, Business Insider, NBC, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times, among others. Local stories from several of the largest US cities will also make the grade; headlines from smaller towns are on their way, Facebook says.
Tapping on those headlines will take you directly to publisher websites or apps, if you have any installed. Which is more or less what publishers have been requesting from Facebook for years.
It’s potentially a big step for a platform that has long struggled with both stamping out misinformation and making nice with struggling purveyors of news. Though media watchers remain skeptical that Facebook is really committed to helping sustain the news industry.
Facebook declined to say who is getting paid and how much, saying only that it will be paying “a range of publishers for access to all of their content.” Just last year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wasn’t sure it “makes sense ” to pay news outlets for their material.
But now, as Zuckerberg told The Associated Press in an interview, “there’s an opportunity to set up new long term, stable financial relationships with publishers.”
News executives have long been unhappy about the extent to which digital giants like Facebook make use of their stories — mostly by displaying headlines and short summaries when users post news links. A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress this year would grant an antitrust exemption to news companies, letting them band together to negotiate payments from the big tech platforms.
“It’s a good direction that they’re willing for the first time to value and pay for news content,” said David Chavern, head of the News Media Alliance, a publisher trade group. “The trouble is that most publishers aren’t included.”
Zuckerberg said Facebook aims to set up partnerships with a “wide range” of publishers.
“We think that this is an opportunity to build something quite meaningful here,” he said. “We’re going to have journalists curating this, we are really focused on provenance and branding and where the stories come from.”
In a statement, the Los Angeles Times said it expects the Facebook effort will help expand its readership and digital subscribers.
Facebook killed its previous effort to curate news, the ill-fated Trending topics, in 2018. Conservatives complained about political bias, leading Facebook to fire its human editors and automate the section until it began recycling false stories, after which the social giant shut it down entirely.
But what happens when the sprawling social network plays news editor? An approach that sends people news based on what they’ve liked before could over time elevate stories with greater “emotional resonance” over news that “allows public discourse to take place,” said Edward Wasserman, dean of the graduate journalism program at the University of California-Berkeley.
“It deepens my concern that they’ll be applying Facebook logic to news judgment,” he added.
The social network has come under criticism for its news judgment recently. In September, it removed a fact-check from Science Feedback that called out an anti-abortion activist’s video for claiming that abortion is never medically necessary. Republican senators had complained about the fact check.
Facebook says a small team of “seasoned” journalists it employs will choose the headlines for the “Today’s Story” section of the tab, designed to “catch you up” on the day’s news. The rest of the news section will be populated with stories algorithmically based on users’ interests.
That sounds similar to the approach taken by Apple News , a free iPhone app. But Apple’s effort to contract with news organisations has been slow to take off. Apple News Plus, a $10-a-month paid version, remains primarily a hub for magazines; other news publishers have largely sat it out.
Apple’s service reportedly offered publishers only half the revenue it pulled in from subscriptions, divided according to how popular publishers were with readers.

335,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/fossil-trove-shows-lifes-fast-recovery-after-big-extinction/,"NEW YORK: A remarkable trove of fossils from Colorado has revealed details of how mammals grew larger and plants evolved after the cataclysm that killed the dinosaurs.
The thousands of specimens let scientists trace that history over a span of 1 million years, a mere eyeblink in Earth’s lifespan.
Sixty-six million years ago, a large meteorite smashed into what is now the Yucatan Peninsula of southeastern Mexico. It unleashed broiling waves of heat and filled the sky with aerosols that blotted out the sun for months, killing off plants and the animals that depended on them.
More than three-quarters of species on Earth died out.
But life came back, and land mammals began to expand from being small creatures into the wide array of forms we see today — including us.
So the new find taps into “the origin of the modern world,” said Tyler Lyson, an author of a paper reporting the fossil finds Thursday in the journal Science.
The fossils were recovered from an area of steep bluffs covering about 10 square miles (17 square kilometres) near Colorado Springs, starting three years ago.
Lyson, of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, found little in that area when he followed the standard practice of scanning for bits of bone. But that changed when he began looking instead for rocks that can form around bone. When the rocks were broken open, skulls and other fossils within were revealed.
Lyson said it’s not clear how wide a geographic region the fossils’ story of recovery applies to, but that he thinks they show what happened over North America.
“We just know so little about this everywhere on the globe,” he said. “At least now we have at one spot a fantastic record.”

Experts not connected to the study were enthusiastic.
It’s “an unparalleled documentary of how life on land recovered” after the asteroid impact, said P. David Polly of Indiana University in Bloomington. “The sheer number of fossil specimens and the quality of their preservation are exceptional” for this time period, he said.
The fossils’ story certainly represents what happened in central North America and perhaps more broadly, he wrote in an email.
Stephanie Smith of the Field Museum in Chicago said the study’s detailed focus on a single area can help scientists understand the complexity of recovery when combined with results from elsewhere.
Scientists have previously found little evidence about what happened in the aftermath of the meteorite crash, especially on land, said Jin Meng of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The new work, he said in an email, appears to provide “the best record on Earth to date.”
The study reports on hundreds of mammal fossils representing 16 species and more than 6,000 plant fossils. Researchers also analyzed thousands of pollen grains to see what plants were alive at various times. Analysis of leaves indicated several warming periods during the period.
Here’s the recovery story the fossils tell:
The area had been a forest before the meteorite hit, home to dinosaurs like T. rex and mammals no bigger than about 17 pounds (8 kilograms).
Soon after the disaster, the environment was blanketed with ferns and the biggest mammal around was about as heavy as a rat. The world was in a warming period, as documented in previous studies.
By about 100,000 years after the meteorite impact, the forest was dominated by palm trees and mammals had grown to the weight of raccoons, almost as big as before the meteorite crash. “That’s a pretty rapid recovery, or at least one aspect of recovery,” Lyson said.
By 300,000 years, the walnut tree family had diversified, and the biggest mammals were plant eaters about as heavy as a large beaver. Based on other studies of their diet, they may have evolved along with those trees, Lyson said.
By 700,000 years, the fossil record shows the first known appearance of legume plants, the family that includes peas and beans. And it reveals the two largest mammals found in the study, with the larger one weighing about 100 pounds (50 kilograms), roughly like a wolf. That is about 100 times heavier than the mammals that survived the extinction, “which I think is pretty fast” for growth, Lyson said.
What drove mammals to get bigger? The main factor was the disappearance of the dinosaurs, leaving an ecological niche to be filled, he said. But the quality and types of food on the landscape probably also played a role, he said. The simultaneous appearance of legume plants and bigger mammals suggests the plants may have provided a “protein bar moment,” Lyson said.
He said the mammals were creatures that evolved from animals that had survived extinction or those that immigrated from elsewhere.
Zhe-Xi Luo of the University of Chicago, who did not participate in the work, said the report is remarkable for tying together records for plants, mammals and temperature, giving a “holistic picture.”
Scientists expected mammals to recover after the dinosaur extinctions, he said, and the new work “is a huge step forward in getting a firm understanding about just how it happened.”

336,https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/labuschagne-double-century-and-nz-resilience-highlight-day-2/,"SYDNEY: Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne’s stellar summer reached a new peak with his first double century before New Zealand showed great resolve on a deteriorating Sydney Cricket Ground pitch to battle its way to 63 without loss on the second day of the third test.
Labuschagne scored 215 off 363 balls, with 19 boundaries and a six, before his epic innings was ended amidst a late order collapse by the hosts to be all out for 454 by tea on Saturday.
New Zealand openers Tom Blundell and captain Tom Latham found scoring difficult on a SCG pitch starting to show variable bounce and pace, but crucially for the tourists finished the day with their wickets intact on a hot, and at times smoky, afternoon.
Latham reached stumps unbeaten on 26, with Blundell, coming off the back of a century in Melbourne, 34 not out. Both batsmen showed patience in their stroke play and survived some frightening deliveries, especially from Pat Cummins, which unexpectedly reared up at the body.
But not for the first time this summer it was Labuschagne’s day, despite a slow crawl toward his double hundred milestone.
It took well over an hour into the middle session for Labuschagne to get the final 19 runs he needed from his 181 not out at lunch and the 25-year-old was stalled for several overs on 199 before a streaky outside edge off Colin de Grandhomme raced away for a boundary and his first double century off 346 balls.
“You do get nervous,” Labuschagne said. “You probably don’t get nervous as you would on 99. I don’t know why. But that’s just the feeling. When you’re in the 190s, for me it’s just about not doing something silly.”
The world’s fourth-ranked batsman has scored 837 runs in five matches, including four centuries, this summer which is the most by any Australian over a five-test home program, eclipsing Neil Harvey’s 834 runs in 1952-53 against South Africa.
“That’s very special, going past a player of that caliber,” Labuschagne said. “It’s hard because, when you’re midway through a game or series, you don’t have time to reflect on the summer that you’ve had. It’s been a very special summer but I think what makes it even more special is the camaraderie of this team.”
The innings also helped his career average to 63.63, above Steve Smith’s 62.84 and second only on the record list to Don Bradman (99.94).
Skipper Tim Paine, who shared a 79-run partnership with Labuschagne, scored 35 before he was bowled by de Grandhomme (3-78) which triggered a late-order collapse for the hosts.
Astle then snared Labuschagne caught and bowled and Cummins for two, either side of Wagner bowling James Pattinson (2).
Some lusty hitting from Mitchell Starc (22) saw Australia pass 450 before Wagner (3-66) hit his middle stump to end the innings.
Resuming Saturday morning at 283-3, Australia added 71 runs for the loss of two wickets before lunch in an even session.
After making five changes for this match, four of which were for illness or injury, New Zealand’s tour took another blow with news that seamer Matt Henry had broken his thumb early on the first day and Jeet Raval had taken ill.
Henry continued to bowl as the injury is to his non-bowling hand, while Raval reappeared in the field later in the first session.
Despite the latest personnel setbacks, Saturday’s first session was New Zealand’s best in the field with spinner Will Somerville bowling Matt Wade (22) in the first over the morning, before Henry had Travis Head caught behind for 10 as they limited the hosts to 71 runs in two hours.
On Friday, Labuschagne and Steve Smith (63) combined for a 156-run partnership to swing the momentum firmly toward the hosts after Paine won the toss and batted.
Australia is seeking a clean sweep after winning the first two tests at Perth and Melbourne.

Tribhuvan Army Club defeated Nepal APF Club 3-1 on penalties in the final of the Martyr Ridamahang-Ramalihang Aathpahariya first Women’s Gold Cup at the local Tundikhel grounds today.
The match was decided in tie-breaker after both the teams failed to score in the regulation period of 80 minutes. Rashmi Ghising, Puja Rana Magar and Nisha Bohora scored for TAC, while only Manju Thing was able to score from the spot for APF. Star striker Sabitra Bhandari, Anita Basnet and Gita Rana Magar wasted their shots for APF in penalty shootout.

With their first win in final in five years against the departmental rivals, TAC took revenge of the loss in the final of the seventh CoAS International Women’s Football Tournament in Kathmandu last month. The TAC had last defeated APF in the final of the second edition of the CoAS Cup.
Both the teams created a couple of opportunities but they failed to find the back of the nets in regulation period after rain and fog made it difficult for the players. Nepal APF Club wasted a penalty, while TAC had at least three goal-bound strikes saved by goalkeeper Anjila Tumbamfe. The condition was so poor that the organisers were forced to scrap the extra time and decide the winners through penalty shootout directly.
Champions TAC received Rs 200,000, while APF got Rs 100,000. Sabitra Bhandari was declared the player of the tournament, while her APF teammates Gita Rana and Renuka Nagarkoti were named the best defender and midfielder respectively. Likewise, TAC’s Rashmi Ghising, Sharmila Thapa Magar and Chakra Tamang were declared the best forward, highest scorer and coach respectively. A total of eight teams took part in the tournament organised by Kirat Aathpahariya Society Nepal. Dhankuta Municipality Mayor Chintan Tamang among others handed over the prizes to the winners of the tournament.

Tamang, who won the SA Games gold medal with the record score of 14-under at the same venue, registered a 25-stroke victory over Abhirajsinh S Chauhan. The Indian golfer shot six-over 78 to finish second with the total score of 14-over 230.
Acharya, who was five strokes behind overnight leader Ritesh Tamang in the boys’ 12-16yrs category, produced the best card of the day to register five-shot victory on a rainy day. The 13-year-old golfer took the turn at four-under 32 and played even-par 36 on the back nine. He carded birdies on the second, fifth, sixth and eighth holes on the front nine. Acharya was six-under after two consecutive birdies on the 13th and 14th but he suffered a double bogey on the 15th hole.

Third-place Sevilla is four points behind leader Barcelona and two points behind second-place Real Madrid.
Barcelona visits last-place Espanyol on Saturday, while Madrid is at Getafe. Atlético Madrid can pull level with Sevilla if it beats Levante, also on Saturday.
Bilbao controlled the match in Seville in the first half and went ahead in the 15th minute when right back Ander Capa received the ball on the side of the area and fired a shot under goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik.
Sevilla increased the pace after halftime and got its reward when Bilbao defender Unai Nuñez deflected a low cross by Lucas Ocampos into his own net with half an hour left.
“They had one scoring chance and put it in,” Ocampos said. “We found our pace in the second half and got the draw. But we leave with a bittersweet taste since we couldn’t get the victory.”
Sevilla will not have Ocampos, its top scorer in the league with five goals, for next round’s match at Madrid after he picked up a fifth booking of the season for a foul in the second half.
Bilbao striker Iñaki Williams had to be substituted for what appeared to be a leg injury late in the match. He walked off the field.
Bilbao, which stayed in seventh place, also earned a 0-0 draw at Madrid in the previous round.
“We are playing well at the back. That is our strength and we need to keep that up,” Capa said. “The own-goal is just too bad.”
Also, Valladolid striker Enes Unal scored his second goal of a brace with 11 minutes left to earn a 2-2 draw at home against Leganés.

CAPE TOWN: South Africa grabbed the wickets of England captain Joe Root and Joe Denly to leave England four wickets down for 149 at tea on the opening day of the second test at Newlands on Friday.
Root picked up the run rate after lunch but was caught out off his gloves as he ducked into a vicious bouncer from Anrich Nortje to depart for 35 off 49 balls.
He had been dropped in the slips two balls earlier by Rassie van der Dussen but it did not prove costly for home side.
Ben Stokes, who hit a career-high 258 when he was last at the picturesque Cape Town ground four years ago, was 28 not out along with Ollie Pope (5), one of three changes to the tourists’ line-up after they lost the first test by 107 runs.
Denly (38) was bowled by a full delivery from spinner Keshav Maharaj that clipped the top of his off stump.
England, who won the toss and elected to bat on a wicket expected to be full of runs, lost Zak Crawley cheaply for four in the third over and Dom Sibley for 34 just before lunch.
Both were caught behind by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock as fast bowlers Vernon Philander and Kagiso Rabada claimed the first two wickets of the match.
The 21-year-old Crawley was making his second test appearance after being brought in to replace the injured Rory Burns, who hurt his ankle playing soccer on Thursday in the latest setback for England on a calamity-filled tour.
Pace bowler Jofra Archer was left out of the team after suffering an elbow injury and was due to go for further scans on Friday.

SYDNEY: Any hopes New Zealand had that the New Year would bring a change of fortune on their tour of Australia were shattered on Friday by a combination of illness, a lost toss, some questionable selections and brilliant batting from their hosts.
At the end of the first day of the third test, a match the Black Caps must at least draw to avoid a 3-0 series sweep, they were already in a big hole with Australia on 283 for three and centurion Marnus Labuschagne still at the crease.
The first blow did not come entirely out of the blue with captain Kane Williamson and batsman Henry Nicholls having missed training on the previous two days with a flu bug that was sweeping through the squad.
Spinner Mitchell Santner joined them in the sick bay on Thursday and while he was ruled out altogether on Friday, Williamson and Nicholls were allowed a net to test their fitness.
“You could see pretty quickly that they weren’t right. Both those guys have been tough competitors and tough people,” said coach Gary Stead.
“And when you don’t get an argument back around whether you should play or not, you know they are not very well.”
The bug led to three changes to the team that lost heavily in Melbourne last weekend with batsman Glenn Phillips, who was flown over as cover on Thursday, handed his first cap.
A fourth change was forced by the injury suffered by paceman Trent Boult in the second test, but the fifth and last was the unexpected decision to drop experienced quick Tim Southee in favour of Matt Henry.
“We just felt we wanted a bit more pace out there with what Matt offers over Tim,” Stead added.
“The workload that Tim’s had, not just in the last two tests, but you put the last four together it’s somewhere around about 200 overs in a short period of time, we felt that Matt would have given us a point of difference.”
Southee and Henry could have both played, had New Zealand not elected to reduce their pace attack by one to make room for twin spinners Todd Astle and Will Sommervile on what they thought would be a dry wicket.
That decision looked all the more questionable once stand-in captain Tom Latham had lost the toss.
“We make decisions on what is in front of us and what are the best decisions to make at the time,” Stead said of the three-man selection panel. “We live and die by those as well.”

343,https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/relentless-liverpool-on-course-to-shatter-premier-league-points-record/,"
LONDON: Liverpool are on course to shatter the Premier League’s record points haul and the way Juergen Klopp’s side are churning out wins it would now be a surprise if they failed to do so.
When Manchester City won the title in 2017-18 it was felt their 100-point total, a new Premier League record, would become a high-water mark to endure for many years.
City’s haul that year was five more than the previous Premier League record of 95 set by Chelsea under Jose Mourinho in 2014-15, although they needed almost as many last season when they topped the table with 98 to Liverpool‘s 97.
Liverpool‘s 2-0 win over Sheffield United on Thursday means they have 58 points from a possible 60 after 20 games — the tally Man City achieved at the same stage two years ago.
With 19 wins and a draw they are averaging 2.90 points per game, putting them on course for 110 from 38 games which would also be a record for Europe’s top five leagues.
Even with a couple of defeats or a few draws they would still would top City’s 2018 total.
Since losing to Manchester City exactly a year ago, Liverpool are unbeaten in the Premier League, taking 101 points from 37 games during that period.
Only two other teams have gone a year unbeaten in the Premier League — Arsenal’s so-called invincibles in 2003-04 (a run of 49 Premier League games) and Chelsea (40 matches) from October 2004 to November 2005.
Since that City defeat, Liverpool have won 32 of their 37 league matches, averaging 2.7 points per game.
They are 13 points clear of Leicester City having played a game less and those desperately seeking a chink in Liverpool‘s armour appear to wasting their time.
They have scored in 29 successive league games and have netted 89 goals in their year-long unbeaten run.
Liverpool have won their 11 league games and have even stopped leaking goals, a theme earlier in the season when they went eight games without clean sheet. They have scored 12 goals without reply in their last five league matches.
Yet Klopp believes his side are still improving.
“We can do things better and we have to,” he said after the win over Sheffield United. “In the dressing room there was no party or something.”
While a first English title since 1989-90 looks a formality, Liverpool still have a way to go to match other great runs in European football.
Arsenal’s 49-match streak is beatable this season but matching AC Milan’s remarkable 58-game run without a Serie A loss from 1991-1993 still looks a distant prospect.
To emulate that great Milan side would require Liverpool to go unbeaten in the Premier League until November. Even to break the British record looks a daunting task with Celtic’s 62-match unbeaten league run between 1915 and 1917 looking untouchable.

CAPE TOWN: England lost opener Zak Crawley early and Dom Sibley just before lunch as they reached 67 for two wickets on the opening day of the second test against South Africa at Newlands on Friday.
The 21-year-old Crawley, playing only his second test, came in at the top of the order for Rory Burns, who was ruled out of the rest of the tour on Thursday after injuring his ankle in a soccer kick-about.
Crawley, however, was out in the third over of the day, edging a Vernon Philander delivery behind to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock for four runs.
Opening partner Sibley was also caught behind off Kagiso Rabada, getting a healthy nick to a rising delivery, to depart for 34.
Joe Denly on 21 and captain Joe Root (4) were not out at lunch.
Burns’ injury was yet another blow for England, who have had to deal with considerable adversity on the tour, starting with a flu bug which spread through their camp on their arrival in South Africa in the middle of last month.
That was followed by injuries to Burns and pace bowler Jofra Archer, who was left out on Friday.
Archer has a recurring elbow injury and did not bowl in practice over the last two days, with England opting to rest him in the hope that he can be fit for the remainder of the four-match series.
Officials said on Friday that he would go for a second scan to better diagnose the injury.
England also brought Ollie Pope and Dominic Bess into the team after the first-test defeat as they won the toss and elected to bat on a hot first day at Newlands.
Off-spinner Bess was not originally selected for the tour squad but flew to South Africa as cover ahead of the first test when several players were bed-ridden.
South Africa handed opener Pieter Malan a test debut at the age of 30 in place of the injured Aiden Markram, who underwent surgery this week on a broken finger and will play no further part in the series.
South Africa won the first test in Pretoria by 107 runs.

352,https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/sudans-women-pursue-soccer-dream-challenging-conservatives/,"OMDURMAN: All her life, Elham Balatone wanted to play soccer — like her brothers, like the boys on her street. But in the Sudan where she grew up, women could be flogged for wearing pants, let alone soccer shorts. She heard all the reasons why she had to give up her dream. It’s a Muslim country; the uniform is inappropriate; the sport was meant for men.
She played anyway, wearing pants or putting on leggings underneath shorts.
“There’s nothing in this world that I love more than soccer. Please let me play,” she says she told her family. For years, she and other women played largely in the shadows, sometimes on dirt pitches they cleaned themselves, often bouncing from one spot to another.
The women finally took centre stage when the world watched them play at a Khartoum stadium as the youth and sports minister and others celebrated Sudan’s new, officially recognized women’s soccer league. Balatone even had her family’s blessings.
But it’s more than just a game. The women’s league became a field of contention as Sudan grapples with the transition from three decades of authoritarian rule that espoused a strict interpretation of Islamic Shariah law and, activists say, disenfranchised women in particular.
Transitional authorities have taken some steps to roll back the legacy of ousted President Omar al-Bashir. In November, they overturned a notorious “public order” law that the prime minister said had been used as a “tool of exploitation, humiliation,” resulting in “atrocities” against women and youth. Rights defenders call it a step in the right direction, but say the fight is far from over.
Some ultraconservatives, however, have been pushing back. Preacher AbdulHay Yousif and others have painted soccer as part of a battle for Sudan’s identity.
“What religion, what Shariah, what manhood would allow a Muslim woman to appear before men … with her arms, legs and some of her thighs exposed and then run before them,” Yousif told worshippers in October, shortly after the league, made up of 20 teams, started.
“By God, these people have not come … for economic development or social prosperity or scientific elevation. They have come to destroy religion and morals.”
He also denounced the youth and sports minister, a woman, saying she “doesn’t believe in what we believe in” and is a follower of “an apostate” — comments that sparked a legal battle between him and the minister.
A pro-Shariah group that backs Yousif urged preachers “to use their pulpits to make the truth victorious and to defend the constants of Shariah … and expose the government’s secularization plots.”
Critics argue some conservatives are using an old playbook in Sudan: weaponizing stringent religious views to target political opponents, control women and thwart change.
“Clearly this is part of an effort by Yousif to undermine the new government by stimulating a ‘moral panic’ regarding the subversion of gender roles. Partly it’s about his religious views, but it is predominantly a patriarchal form of gender politics,” said Willow Berridge, a lecturer in history at Newcastle University who has written about Sudanese Islamists.
Yousif and his supporters “tend to occupy the most uncompromising end of the religious spectrum in Sudan.”
The preacher’s diatribe has had little direct impact on the league. But Taghreed Awoda, an administrator with one of the teams, al-Difaa, and a feminist, said the showdown was part of a larger fight for change.
“To have a women’s soccer league play in Sudan, this dismantles many of the main pillars underpinning the last regime,” she said.

Under al-Bashir, laws like those restricting attire were inconsistently applied and disproportionately targeted the poor and less educated, as well as anti-regime activists, Awoda said. Women players were generally left alone if they kept a low profile, although one group was once briefly arrested, she said.
Preparations for the league began more than a year ago in line with the objectives of the international soccer federation FIFA, said Mervat Hussein, head of the women’s soccer committee at the Sudan Football Association. The efforts accelerated after al-Bashir’s removal, she said. FIFA, which sets criteria for developing women’s soccer, says member associations have objectives to meet to obtain funding.
Women were at the forefront of the protests that eventually pushed the military to overthrow al-Bashir in April.
Hala Al Karib, regional director of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, said this should have translated into more rights, but many laws discriminating against women remain in place even after the public order law was reversed.
She said some hardline Islamists are fighting for their interests after losing clout in al-Bashir’s fall, arguing their rhetoric finds little resonance. Women’s issues usually “get turned into bargaining chips” and risk being sacrificed to appease hardline groups, she said.
In the midst of all the wrangling is the story of women who say they just want to play soccer.
“These are people who have struggled, toiled and have pressed ahead in the face of so many attempts to destroy their talents,” said Amany Anas, a player for al-Tahadi team. “Now the moment has come when they can show people that women could play just like men.”
Al-Difaa player Fatima Gadal said in the past players sometimes used their own money to buy balls and gear. At times, she skipped buying food to afford bus fare to go play. “We were very much so on the margins.”
Some things are still austere. After a recent game in Omdurman, Khartoum’s twin city, the al-Difaa team squeezed into a minibus with cracked windows, rusty interiors and not enough seats. The engine soon quit and team members pushed the bus, cheering when the engine restarted.
The players hope official recognition will now result in more opportunities. Some families asked to enroll their daughters after they saw the league, said Anas.
At the Omdurman game, the players picked up fans — men and women.
One spectator, Akram Abdel-Aziz, said he didn’t expect to see women play soccer in Sudan.
“It’s a lovely thing that I hope will continue. I love the courage of the women on the field,” he said. “I pray and I am a believer … and I can see that women are covered up and dressed modestly.”
On the field, most players wear leggings under their shorts, but otherwise are in regular soccer kit, and many don’t cover their hair.
Some are not convinced. After praying at the mosque where Yousif preaches, a woman who gave her name only as Balqis said she wouldn’t allow her daughters to follow in the players’ footsteps, stressing the need for modest attire.
“We’re Muslim people and we love our Islam and how religious we are,” she said. Women sports were fine in closed areas, she said.
The players say there’s no conflict between their faith and their sport.
Gadal said she once heard men at the stadium saying women playing the game was “haram,” or religiously forbidden, and the players belonged at home. She ignored them.
“I fast, I pray and I perform my Islamic duties. I see no problem,” she said, pointing out that numerous Muslim countries field women’s soccer teams.
Balatone, who was raised in a conservative household that is “religious but not extremist,” said she once explained to her brother why she was so determined to play.
She had already given up a lot. She had three passions: singing, soccer and English. She couldn’t afford college, she dropped singing because she was told it’s haram.
“When it came to soccer, I said ‘Excuse me, I cannot let soccer go,’” she said. “We live and breathe soccer.”

HONG KONG: Former Everton midfielder Li Tie is the new head coach of China’s national team, the country’s football association announced on Thursday.
Li takes over as the long-term replacement for Marcello Lippi, who quit following a surprise loss to Syria in November in a qualifying match for the 2022 World Cup.
Li, 42, was selected from a three-man short-list by the Chinese Football Association having led a reserve side to the East Asian Championships in South Korea in December.
As a player, Li represented China on 92 occasions, including at the finals of the 2002 World Cup, the country’s only appearance at the competition to date.
Later that summer Li moved to England from Chinese side Liaoning to join Everton, initially on loan, and spent three seasons with the Goodison Park-based club.
Li retired from playing in 2011 and worked under Lippi as an assistant coach with both Guangzhou Evergrande, where he won the Asian Champions League title in 2013, and the senior national side before taking over as head coach of Hebei CFFC.
He was appointed head coach of Wuhan Zall during the 2017 season, leading the club out of the second division to a sixth-place finish in the Chinese Super League by the end of the 2019 campaign.
Li will meet up with his players on Sunday for a training camp in Guangzhou. His first competitive match in charge will come on March 26, when China play the Maldives in qualifying for Qatar 2022.
China trail Syria in Group A of Asia’s second phase of qualifying for the World Cup, with only the winners guaranteed to advance to the next round, where four of the continent’s berths at the finals will be filled.

LIVERPOOL: Goals from Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane helped Premier League leaders Liverpool restore their 13-point advantage at the top of the table as they saw off a valiant Sheffield United 2-0 at Anfield on Thursday.

Salah opened the scoring on four minutes, capitalising on a slip from United defender George Baldock. Mane tapped in from close range on 64 minutes after his original effort had been saved to secure a victory that marked Liverpool being unbeaten in the top flight for a year.
Jurgen Klopp’s side have 58 points from 20 games – a feat only matched by Manchester City’s 2017-18 title winning side – while Sheffield United sit eighth, seven points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.
Liverpool were far from their dazzling best but had too much quality for the newly-promoted outfit, which they illustrated by amassing a club-record 874 passes against The Blades.
“It was very unlike us. We didn’t lay a glove on them or do anything that has got us into this position,” Sheffield coach Chris Wilder told BT Sport.
“I thought they were outstanding. They didn’t have to get out of second or third gear, though. When we played them at our place we laid a glove on them and made it difficult, but they won every first ball, dropped on every second ball, ran forward and ran back. They did that miles better than us.
“They still had the humility and desire to do all that as world champions, as European champions and they’re well on their way to being Premier League champions.”
The only blot for Liverpool was when midfielder Naby Keita limped off during the warm-up. The Guinean was replaced in the starting line-up by James Milner, and was ruled out of Sunday’s Merseyside derby by Klopp post-match.
The opener came after Baldock slipped under Virgil van Dijk’s long ball, allowing Andy Robertson to break into the box and square for Salah, who swept in his 10th league strike of the season.
It marked the beginning of a lively opening 15 minutes in which John Lundstram saw a looping effort land just wide for the visitors, as well as having an equaliser correctly ruled out for offside.
Salah was denied a second by a spectacular Dean Henderson save before Georginio Wijnaldum fired narrowly over.
Salah then hit the post after the restart. But he showed excellent composure to feed Mane, whose initial effort was parried by Henderson – but he netted the rebound.
The home crowd were spared a nervy finale as substitute Oliver McBurnie contrived to steer Enda Stevens’ inviting cross straight at Alisson Becker from inside the six-yard box with two minutes remaining.

Nawayug Shrestha and Santosh Tamang scored in the second half as TAC registered their third straight victory. The win took the departmental side to second position with nine points, while Three Star faced their first defeat and they have seven points.

After a goalless draw in the first half, Shrestha opened the scoring with an acrobatic goal following a pass from his skipper Bharat Khawas in the 54th minute. Tamang then sealed the victory in the 79th minute after he converted the free kick from 25 yards into the goal.
Tamang returned to the team after serving 45-day suspension for spending a night in Thamel on the eve of national team’s departure to Bhutan. Tamang and three others — Bimal Gharti Magar, Anjan Bista and Dinesh Rajbanshi — were barred from traveling to Bhutan and later slapped with hefty suspensions.

In another match, Suman Lama netted a brace for NPC, while Amit Tamang replied for Sankata. With the win, NPC accumulated seven points, while Sankata have four.
Lama opened the scoring in the 15th minute after he capitalised on misunderstanding between Sankata goalkeeper and defenders. Sankata earned a penalty kick three minutes later after Ajit Bhandari handled the ball inside the area and Tamang converted from the spot to level the scores.
Lama restored the lead in the 33rd minute after he collected a pass from Prawesh Kunwar and beat Sankata goalkeeper Binaya Shrestha in one-on-one situation.

MANCHESTER: Danny Ings continued his fine scoring form to earn Southampton a 1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur – who had striker Harry Kane go off injured – in the Premier League on New Year’s Day, while Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw at Brighton & Hove Albion.
Brighton forward Alireza Jahanbakhsh’s brilliant equaliser denied Chelsea winning back-to-back league matches for the first time since November.
The draw means fourth-placed Chelsea are five points clear of Manchester United, in action later in the day at Arsenal, and six clear of Spurs after another away defeat.
Despite early improvements under coach Jose Mourinho, Spurs have suffered from inconsistency of late, with their loss at St Mary’s derailing their push for the top four.
Days after a laboured showing in a 2-2 draw at bottom side Norwich City, Spurs could not find a way back into the game after Ings’ eighth goal in his last nine appearances in the 17th minute.
Kane thought he had equalised late in the second half, but he was adjudged to be offside. The England captain then limped off, seemingly with a hamstring injury.
“We see the bad result today which is the continuity of the last year,” Mourinho said.
“For 12 months, it has been very difficult to get results away from home. The work is not about buying, it is about working with the players on the pitch. It is something that is very difficult for us because we have no time to do it.”
GOAL OF THE SEASON CONTENDER
Chelsea have also struggled for consistency over the festive period, but looked to be on course for victory at the Amex Stadium to follow their success at Arsenal on Saturday.
Cesar Azpilicueta celebrated his 100th start as Chelsea captain by putting Chelsea in front, guiding the ball home from close range in the 10th minute.
The visitors held on to that lead until the 84th minute, when Iranian Jahanbakhsh came off the bench to spectacularly earn his side a point, firing home an incredible overhead kick.
“When I saw the ball, I just tried to hit it as hard as I could and the bicycle kick was the only option,” he said. “I’m going to watch it a couple more times.”
The result helped Brighton end a run of nine straight league defeats by Chelsea stretching back to 1983.
Leicester City recorded a comfortable 3-0 victory at Newcastle United — their second away win in as many games.
Former Newcastle forward Ayoze Perez got the ball rolling in the first half for Brendan Rodgers’ side, before a stunning strike from James Maddison made it two before halftime.
Hamza Choudhury’s first goal for the club was the icing on the cake for Leicester, who closed the gap to Liverpool at the top of the table to 10 points.
Watford continued their resurgence under new manager Nigel Pearson as they made it three wins from their last four games with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers.
Christian Kabasele was sent off after the intervention of VAR with 20 minutes to go, but the home side held on for the win.
Earlier in the day, Aston Villa earned just their second away win of the season with a 2-1 success at Burnley, who have now lost six of their last eight games.

MANCHESTER: Two goals from Gabriel Jesus helped a nervy Manchester City earn a 2-1 victory over Everton at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, as new manager Carlo Ancelotti suffered his first Premier League defeat since taking charge of the Merseyside club.

Ancelotti had enjoyed two wins from two before the trip to Manchester, but the writing appeared to be on the wall as Phil Foden thought he gave City a 13th minute lead, only for the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) to spot an offside in the build up.
For the remainder of the first half, City were not at their best, but came out after the interval with added impetus, taking the lead in 51st minute through Gabriel Jesus – the Brazilian’s sixth goal in five matches against Everton.
That soon became seven in five as Jesus drilled home Riyad Mahrez’s pass seven minutes later to make it two, only for stand-in City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo to gift Everton a way back into the match as Richarlison scored with 19 minutes left.
The home fans held their breath as City looked uneasy defensively and Everton pressed for the equaliser, but the visitors could not find that killer final pass as City held on.
City’s fourth win in their last five games sees them stay one point behind second-placed Leicester City and 11 behind leaders Liverpool, having played two games more than the Reds.
Everton remain 10th.
“When you are far away from first sometimes people give up, but we never give up,” City manager Pep Guardiola said. “We have to keep going.”
Guardiola made five changes from the side who beat Sheffield United, with goalkeeper Ederson ill and unable to start.
Riyad Mahrez was the man, correctly, adjudged to have been offside when Foden thought he had scored, with the hosts then taking until the 24th minute to have a shot at goal, the latest they have had to wait for a shot at goal at home since January.
Twelve of City’s 16 home league goals this season had come in the second half prior to Everton’s visit and it took only six minutes after the break for Jesus to strike, collecting Ilkay Gundogan’s pass before finishing well.
Another fine move saw City double their advantage, as Foden laid the ball off for Mahrez, who slid Jesus in for the Brazilian to slot home his 13th goal in all competitions this season.
Bravo was then far too casual when picking a pass, Theo Walcott drilled across goal, with Richarlison sneaking the ball in.
City had chances to make the game safe but Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford stood firm.
“At the end City deserved to win — they were better than us,” Ancelotti said. We need time to work and adjust things which are not good.”

LONDON: Arsenal earned their first win under new coach Mikel Arteta by comprehensively overpowering a stale Manchester United side 2-0 in the Premier League on Wednesday with goals from Nicolas Pepe and Sokratis.
Club record signing Pepe put Arsenal ahead in the 10th minute of their third game under their former player by lashing into the net after good work down the left flank from Sead Kolasinac. Pepe later hit the post in a dominant first-half display from Arsenal before defender Sokratis deservedly doubled their lead in the 42nd minute by pouncing on some hesitant defending from the visitors following a corner. Arsenal comfortably saw out their advantage to record a first league win in five games which took them up to 10th in the standings on 27 points after 21 games.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side remain fifth on 31 points after missing out on the chance to close the gap on fourth-placed Chelsea, who drew 1-1 at Brighton & Hove Albion earlier in the day and are five points above United.
“I think it was great. We were great in the first half and showed a maturity in the second,” said Arsenal defender David Luiz.
“Mikel Arteta is a great coach, he was a great player. I think he can improve every player. Our season started very bad but things can change.”
United were searching for a third consecutive win but were out-fought by Arsenal and rarely looked capable of staging a revival, even after Mason Greenwood and Andreas Pereira came on and injected some energy into their attack.
UNITED ‘NOT GOOD ENOUGH’
“They played with high intensity, aggression and passed the ball way better than us,” said United defender Harry Maguire.
“The second goal was disappointing, we are conceding far too many from set plays. We need to do the basics. And to lose the second gave us too much to do in the second half. We huffed and puffed but it wasn’t good enough.”
Once considered the Premier League’s showpiece fixture when the clubs routinely battled for the title but, United and Arsenal now find themselves caught up in a topsy-turvy campaign.
United were without Paul Pogba after the France international hurt his ankle and also missed the services of midfielder Scott McTominay.
His replacement, Nemanja Matic, was sluggish in his passing and frequently beaten by Arsenal’s Lucas Torreira, although Pepe was the home side’s chief creator.
The Gunners also looked far more assured in defence than they have all season and were quick to snuff out United’s attackers whenever they advanced towards their area.
“We have started again, I think we have a lot of space to improve,” added goalscorer Sokratis.
“The second half we didn’t play like the first but I think every game we are getting better. The fun is back.”

BURNLEY: Struggling Aston Villa picked up just their second away win of the Premier League season, securing three vital points in a 2-1 win at Burnley on New Year’s Day, their first league win at Turf Moor since 1936.
Villa thought they had taken an 11th minute lead through a diving header from Jack Grealish but a VAR review found that Wesley’s heel was marginally offside during the move and the goal was over-turned.
It was exactly the kind of ‘forensic’ use of VAR that has been criticised over the festive period and which has been questioned by the game’s rule-makers IFAB.
But the lengthy break and eventual decision did nothing to interrupt Villa’s momentum as they continued to play positively while Burnley looked to be feeling the pace of the hectic schedule with limited changes to their starting line-up.
It was Wesley who opened the scoring in the 23rd minute — the impressive Grealish finding him in the box and the Brazilian swivelled and fired past Nick Pope to give Villa a deserved lead.
Burnley were unusually sloppy in defence and lacking their usual spirit of work-rate and it was no shock when Grealish doubled Villa’s lead four minutes before the break, finishing off a lovely passing move with a confident curling finish.
Sean Dyche made a double substitution at the break with Jay Rodriguez and Johann Berg Gudmundsson introduced and that had the desired effect with the Clarets much more positive.
Rodriguez and Chris Wood both missed good chances before Wood finally found the target with a back post header from an Ashley Westwood cross in the 80th minute but Burnley were unable to force an equaliser.
Villa’s former Burnley keeper, England international Tom Heaton injured himself during Wood’s goal and was carried off on a stretcher.
Burnley have now lost six of their last eight games and head into a tough run of games where they will face Chelsea, Manchester United, Leicester City and Arsenal.
The win takes Villa, who had lost eight of their last eleven games, out of the bottom three and Grealish, whose class shone throughout, said they had responded to facing up to their situation.
“We had a long meeting during the week and there were some home truths said and it showed today. Burnley is one of the toughest places to come in the league and thankfully we got the win,” he said.
Burnley boss Sean Dyche was nonplussed by his team’s first half display.
“Disappointing result but the frustration is we didn’t turn up today until halftime. You can’t give any team a two-goal headstart and it wasn’t through excellent play, it was from our mistakes,” he said.
“With the quality of chances we created we could’ve nicked something out of the game but you can’t give teams that headstart.”

LONDON: Brighton & Hove Albion forward Alireza Jahanbakhsh scored with a brilliant bicycle kick in the second half to cancel out Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta’s opener in an entertaining 1-1 draw in the Premier League on Wednesday.
The result at the Amex Stadium helped Brighton end a run of nine straight league defeats by Chelsea stretching back to 1983 while Frank Lampard’s side missed the chance to seal back-to-back league wins for the first time since November.
Left back Azpilicueta celebrated his 100th start as Chelsea captain with the opening goal, guiding the ball home from close range in the 10th minute after Tammy Abraham’s shot was blocked near the goal line by Brighton’s Aaron Mooy following a corner.
Substitute Jahanbakhsh then produced an early contender for goal of the year in the 84th minute, with a superb overhead kick that flew into the bottom left corner giving Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga no chance.
“It is an amazing feeling. When I was about to go on, I had a feeling I could have an impact on the game,” Jahanbakhsh, who scored his first Brighton goal in last week’s 2-0 victory over Bournemouth, told the BBC.
“When I saw the ball, I just tried to hit it as hard as I could and the bicycle kick was the only option. I’m going to watch it a couple more times.
“I’m very glad to help the team win points. I couldn’t start the year any better… we did a great job.”
Spaniard Arrizabalaga had earlier kept out substitute Aaron Connolly’s strike from close range and came to Chelsea‘s rescue again after the equaliser when he saved Neal Maupay’s first-time shot from Martin Montoya’s cross.
Chelsea also had opportunities to take all three points with their best chance falling to substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi, but his curled effort from distance narrowly missed the target in the 88th minute.
Lampard said he was frustrated by Chelsea‘s inability to kill off the game in the opening period.
“In the first half, the game was there to be won. We weren’t ruthless enough. We got the goal and we had the possession. But we just didn’t kill the game off,” Lampard said.
“We allowed them to stay in the game. In the end it was a wonder goal but we were lucky not to lose. The tactics matched up for both teams but they were better than us. We have to take that on the chin.”

Rup Bahadur Lama and Bijaya Ghalan scored in second half as Prabhu Jawalakhel Youth Club defeated Chyasal Youth Club 2-0 in the Qatar Airways Martyrs Memorial A Division League here at the ANFA Complex grounds today.
After a goalless first half, Lama scored a sensational goal from the edge of the box in the 81st minute following a cross from Hari Kathayat. JYC doubled the tally two minutes later when Ghalan scored from close in rebound after Chyasal goalkeeper Alan Neupane fumbled Lama’s attempt in front of the goal.
With their second win, JYC accumulated eight points from four matches and are at the third position, two points behind leaders Manang Marshyangdi Club. Machhindra FC are second with nine points. Chyasal faced their second straight defeat after they won a match and played a draw in the previous two games. They are at the ninth position with four points.
Santosh Sahukhala was made to wait in his bid to become the first footballer to score 100 goals as JYC defenders kept him at bay. With 99 goals under his belt, Sahukhala was the centre of attraction but he could not live up to the expectations. He came close to scoring twice but he could not find the back of the nets. After wasting a chance in the 41st minute, Sahukhala penetrated the JYC defense in the 72nd minute and was at a good position to score with goalkeeper Tekendra Thapa being the lone man to stop him. But the former national team striker ended up with a wide shot in an attempt to score in the second bar.
After Taiga Nakamura shot above the cross bar in the 51st minute, JYC took control over the match and they slammed two goals against their neighbours.

Buses from Tokyo’s Shinjuku district conveniently drop climbers off at a station located at the 2,300-metre (7,546 feet) point of the majestic mountain, the country’s tallest at 3,776 metres (12,388 feet). It’s not cheating. This is where most people start the long — and crowded — trek.





The Yoshida trail is the easiest and most popular among the routes to the top, with climbers wearing headlamps and carrying heavy packs spaced just feet apart on the rugged, rocky terrain. It takes an average hiker five to six hours to reach the summit. Most spend the night in simple mountain huts and start the final ascent in darkness. Crammed together in the sparse accommodations is part of the communal climbing experience.
Witnessing the sunrise from the summit of the nation’s symbolic mountain is hard to top. Watching it paint the sky deep orange is magnificent.
Climbing season runs from early July to early September, Mount Fuji will open to the public a couple of weeks before the Tokyo Summer Olympics opening ceremony on July 24.

BANGKOK: Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, edged out Paris and London as the world’s most popular city to visit, according to a survey released on Wednesday, welcome news for Thailand after worries over a drop in foreign arrivals.
Bangkok was named the most-visited city for the fourth consecutive year, with about 22.8 million visitors reported in the annual rankings by MasterCard Inc.
Paris and London were ranked second and third, each with about 19.1 million arrivals, trailed by Dubai with 15.9 million.
Other Southeast Asian cities, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were fourth and fifth in the rankings, based on third-party research, proprietary analysis and public data across 200 destination cities.
New York, Istanbul, Tokyo and Antalya, Turkey, rounded out the top 10.
The number of international visitors across the 200 cities grew by 76% in the last 10 years.
Despite Bangkok’s longtime reign atop the list, the Thai tourism industry has faced headwinds, with arrivals dropping 1.03% year-on-year in May before recovering to grow 0.89% in June from a year earlier.
Tourism accounts for about 12% of Thailand’s economy.
However, weaker Chinese economic growth and a boat accident last year led to a drop off in Chinese arrivals in Thailand in the first half of this year.
The downturn in the number of visitors from China was partially offset by Indian arrivals.
Thailand expects to welcome 2 million Indian tourists in 2019, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, told Reuters, adding this was one year earlier than its target.
In August, the government extended a waiver of a 2,000 baht ($65) fee for visa-on-arrivals for tourists from 18 countries including those from China and India.
A growing middle class and increasing wealth in populations and the rise of low-cost airlines will make travel more accessible, Minor Hotels Chief Executive, Dilip Rajakrier, said in an email.
“Given only less than 10% of the China’s total population having passports today. The potential of the Chinese market will never fade,” he said.

371,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/thailand-extends-visa-fee-waivers-to-boost-tourism-as-growth-slows/,"BANGKOK: Thailand will extend until April next year a measure that waives fees for visas on arrival issued to tourists from 18 countries, as it looks to stimulate growth in tourism to spur a slowing economy, the prime minister said on Tuesday.
The waivers are part of a $10-billion stimulus package to boost growth, including a debt moratorium for farmers, loans for smaller businesses, and more money for low-income earners.
“The cabinet approved the extension of fee waivers until April 2020,” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters, adding that the scheme would cover Lunar New Year and the Thai new year, Songkran.
Foreign tourist receipts make up about 12% of Southeast Asia’s second largest economy, but arrivals increased just 0.89% in June, with visitors from China, the biggest source, declining 7.1% from a year earlier.
The fee of 2,000 baht ($65) is to be waived unil next year for travellers from 18 countries, including China and India.
But the cabinet rejected a proposal for visa-free entry for visitors from China and India, because of security concerns, government spokesman Narumon Pinyosinwat said.

372,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/not-just-bali-indonesia-hopes-to-develop-more-tourism-sites/,"YOGYAKARTA: Hundreds of tourists, many of them young Westerners, sat on grey stone steps atop the world’s largest Buddhist temple, occasionally checking cellphones or whispering to each other as they waited for daylight.
Sunrise wasn’t spectacular on that recent summer day. But even ordinary dawn at Borobudur Temple — nine stone tiers stacked like a wedding cake and adorned with hundreds of Buddha statues and relief panels — provided a memorable experience.

The 9th-century temple is in the centre of Indonesia’s Java island, a densely populated region with stunning vistas. Other highlights include the towering Hindu temple complex of Prambanan, like Borobudur a UNESCO World Heritage site, and Mount Merapi, the country’s most active volcano, whose lava-covered slopes are accessible by jeep.
While the two temples draw many visitors, other foreigners head to the relaxing beaches of Bali, just east of Java and by far the most popular tourist destination in a nation of thousands of islands and almost 270 million people. More than 6 million tourists visited Bali last year, or about 40 per cent of 15.8 million visitors to Indonesia overall, according to official figures.
Recently reelected President Joko Widodo wants to change this dynamic by pushing ahead with “10 new Balis,” an ambitious plan to boost tourism and diversify Southeast Asia’s largest economy.
Key to the plan is to upgrade provincial airports and improve access to outlying destinations, such as Lake Toba on Sumatra island, more than 1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from Jakarta, the capital. Yogyakarta, the provincial city from where visitors head to Borobudur and Prambanan, is getting a second airport, expected to be fully operational later this year.
Widodo has been promoting his plan in meetings with foreign leaders and in recent interviews, including with The Associated Press, in hopes of encouraging foreign investment. The president of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation told the AP in late July that as part of his push, he would like to see more business ties with the Middle East.
“For investment and tourism, we would like to invite investors from the Middle East as much as possible because … we have many tourism locations in Indonesia, not only one or two or four, but many,” said Widodo. He did not give specifics.
Muslim tourists, including from the Middle East, might also be an easier fit for some of the more conservative areas earmarked for tourism development. Tourism officials have played down the possibility of cultural friction that might accompany the influx of more non-Muslim visitors, arguing that Indonesia’s brand of tolerant Islam can accommodate everyone.
“Maybe there are some particular locations that are very strict (religiously),” said Hiramsyah Thaib, who heads the “10 New Balis” initiative. “We believe we won’t have any problems. Sometimes we have problems in the media, but not in reality.”
Yet Islamic hard-liners have become more assertive in recent years, potentially spooking investors by undermining Indonesia’s image as a moderate nation. Thaib said he believes investor confidence rose “significantly” after Widodo defeated former special forces general Prabowo Subianto in April’s presidential election. Subianto had been backed by Muslim groups favouring Shariah law.
The tourism plan remains key to Widodo’s final five-year term, though at least one target — 20 million visitors this year — appears to have been too ambitious. The 2019 visitor tally is expected to be 18 million, based on current growth figures, said Thaib.
Still, the Indonesian tourism sector grew by 7.8 per cent in 2018, or twice the global average, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
One of the 10 sites earmarked for development is the Borobudur Temple area and nearby Yogyakarta, a city of several hundred thousand people that are embedded in a large metro area. The city is a centre of Javanese culture and a seat of royal dynasties going back centuries.
In 2017, former President Barack Obama and his family visited the city, where his late mother, Ann Dunham, spent years doing anthropological research. Obama, who lived in Indonesia as a child, toured Borobudur and Prambanan during the nostalgic trip.
But while the Obamas got around with relative ease, including private jet travel, ordinary visitors struggle with congested streets packed with motorbikes weaving in and out of slow-moving traffic.
Travellers hoping to be in place at Borobudur just before sunrise need at least 90 minutes to get there from Yogyakarta, a journey of 40 kilometres (24 miles). A 230-kilometre (140-mile) round trip to the Dieng highlands, with terraced fields, small temples and a colourful volcanic lake, requires a full day of travel, some of it on bumpy back roads.
Anton McLaughlin, a 55-year-old visitor from York, England, said he was astounded by the number of motorbikes in the streets. Speaking during a jeep tour of the slopes of Mount Merapi, he said he’s become more aware of the natural disasters Indonesians endure regularly. Indonesia straddles the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Merapi’s last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people, and the ruins of one destroyed hamlet were part of the tour.
“People just seem to crack on with life,” McLaughlin said.
Just a day after his tour, the volcano shot out hot clouds and lava that flowed 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) down its slopes. No casualties or damage were reported.
Jan Tenbrinke, 37, from Zwolle in the Netherlands, said Bali is the next stop for his family of four, but that he hoped to get a better sense of Indonesian culture in Yogyakarta.
In the city, tourists can visit workshops for Batik textiles, silver jewellery and Kopi Luwak — coffee made from partially digested coffee cherries that were eaten and defecated by wild tree cats, or civets. Billed as the “world’s most expensive coffee,” Kopi Luwak became known to a wider audience in the 2007 Jack Nicholson-Morgan Freeman movie “The Bucket List.”
Local museums, including two royal palaces and a former Dutch fort, pose a challenge for foreign visitors eager to learn more about local history and culture because they mostly lack easily accessible explanations in English.
Thaib, the tourism official, acknowledged that there is room for improvement. He said Indonesia is determined to catch up to other Asian nations, including Thailand, which he said began developing their tourism industries much sooner.
“There is still a lot of work,” he said of his nation’s efforts. “We believe we are on the right track.”

HIKKADUWA: Sipping fresh coconut water while sunbathing on deserted Hikkaduwa beach, Alexi Konchayenko, a sports trainer from Ukraine, struck a stoical note.
Bomb blasts can happen “anywhere, anytime,” he said, adding that he was not afraid. “Sri Lanka is an amazing country. This is my first visit and I will tell my friends also to come.”
His is a lone voice — and a lone presence. Sri Lanka was the Lonely Planet guide’s top travel destination for 2019, but since the Easter Sunday attacks on churches and luxury hotels, foreign tourists have fled.
Many of those booked to come in the next few months have cancelled. Hotel occupancy across the island has plummeted by 85% to 90%. The tropical beaches, restaurants and shops are empty.
The coordinated suicide bombings on April 21 not only destroyed lives but also wiped out the livelihoods of Sri Lankans who depend on tourism.
More than 250 people, including 45 foreigners mainly from China, India, the US and the UK, died in the Islamic State group-claimed blasts.
Tourists normally come to Hikkaduwa, in the southwest, for the strong waves that are perfect for surfing and sparkling clear waters made for snorkelling. Today, of the 27 hotels, very few are open. Most, along with the eateries that line the 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of palm-fringed beach, are closed.
Among the few hotels still open is Hikkaduwa Beach Hotel. On April 21, all 50 rooms were occupied; today, only a handful. “It’s a real disaster. We don’t know what to do right now,” said Sanjeewani Yogarajah, an executive with the hotel. She said the attack has cost the hotel 5.5 million Sri Lankan rupees ($31,000), forcing the hotel’s management to send half the staff home.
Some tourism officials say the damage to the industry after the bombings is worse than during the 26-year civil war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the government which ended a decade ago. At least then, the violence was mostly contained to the north of Sri Lanka, they said. This time, no part of the island has remained untouched by the blasts.
Lankesha Ponnamperuma, general manager of hotel chain Hikka Tranz, is one of the luckier ones. While most hotels report wholesale cancellations, he is surviving thanks to business from local residents. Last Friday, two-thirds of the 150 rooms were booked, mostly by domestic tourists.
“I haven’t sacked anyone yet. Instead, we are training our people to adjust their expenditure and helping them restructure their bank loans,” Ponnamperuma said.
The president of Sri Lanka’s Hotels Association, Sanath Ukwatta, said hotels have offered 30-50% discounts to entice local residents.
Such a strategy won’t solve the problem, he said, but will “help at least to keep the hotels going.”
The manager of a clothing shop said the owner had shut the group’s other two shops and the factory too. “Business collapsed after April 21,” said Kumari, who declined to give her surname.
According to government figures, there has been an 80% drop in arrivals since the attack. Tourism accounts for 4.9% of Sri Lanka’s GDP. Last year, 2.3 million tourists visited the island, generating $4.4 billion in revenues, a nearly 12% jump from 2017. Around half a million Sri Lankans directly depend on tourism while 2 million depend on it indirectly.
One of them is Mohomed Musflick, the owner of a souvenir shop in Galle which is full of wood carvings, local paintings and postcards. “I have not sold one item. There are no tourists and we are in a huge crisis,” he said.
While life is gradually returning to normal on the island with offices and schools re-opening, the tourism industry is in a sombre mood over the slump in foreign tourists. Tour operators from Russia, Norway and Britain have cancelled bookings going right up to April 2020.
A travel ban issued by nearly a dozen countries is the greatest cause for concern. “The ban is our main worry. Until it is removed or softened, we can’t start our marketing to attract tourists. If it is lifted soon, we are hopeful we can bounce back this year or otherwise definitely next year for sure,” said Yogarajah.
In the meantime, Sri Lanka’s government should target “people and countries resilient to this kind of attacks and situations, such as Russia, Israel and India,” said Anusha Frydman, managing director of the Lavanga Resort and Spa.
The industry is clear about what else it wants from the authorities: Ensure that stringent security measures are in place to reassure potential visitors; persuade politicians to put their differences aside and adopt a bipartisan approach on national security; and work fast to get the travel ban lifted.
To help the industry cope, the government has put together a relief package comprising easy loans at special rates and reduced taxes. The government also plans to formulate a $100 million insurance fund for compensation to any tourist injured or killed while visiting the island.
“In the past we have had many serious crises and we have recovered. I am quite positive we can do it again,” said Jan van Twest, general manager of the Fortress Resort and Spa near Galle, where 750 room nights have been cancelled from May to October.
“But we need to recover, recover very fast,” he said.

Whenever I told someone I was planning to climb to Mount Everest Base Camp this spring, I received the same shocked and wide-eyed response: “Be careful!” While that’s good advice for any adventure, it was difficult to convince friends and family that this trip would not at all be the same thing as actually climbing Mount Everest.
Instead, the Everest Base Camp Trek provides an opportunity for regular hikers like me to tackle a feasible portion of one of the most iconic climbs in the world.
Base Camp is located at 17,600 feet, well below the peak of Everest, which is 29,000 feet. Base Camp is where those planning to summit spend weeks acclimatising and preparing for their journey. It is also the furthest you can go using only your legs before other equipment like ropes and ice picks get involved.
Our eight-day journey to Base Camp began at 9,300 feet, in the small Nepalese mountain town of Lukla. There are no roads to Lukla. It is accessible only by a 30-minute plane ride from Kathmandu. When we landed, I was shocked to find the area crowded and bustling, filled with locals selling trinkets and outdoor gear, and what felt like hundreds of trekkers preparing for their climbs.
From Lukla, we wound our way up muddy paths and across dangling suspension bridges, stepping aside for herds of yak and dzo (yak/cattle hybrids) as we walked further and further into the most remote area in which I have ever hiked.
Yet, it didn’t feel that way. Small towns continued to greet us all the way up. There were lodges to stay in. There were restaurants and bars. I have photos at the world’s highest Irish pub and the world’s highest bakery. In one of the larger towns, Namche Bazaar, at about 11,200 feet, there was even a North Face store. In these towns, dozens of miles from the nearest road, all food and supplies are brought in by helicopter, porter or animal.
In addition to breathtaking, 360-degree views of the Himalayas, elaborate Buddhist monuments lie along the entire route. Every day along the trail we saw massive, intricately painted boulders and colourful stupas (structures meant to bring good karma) wrapped in multicoloured prayer flags. At one point, we even toured a large, fully functioning monastery.
The terrain itself is not as difficult as you’d expect. Anyone in good physical shape could do it, and I have done many other hikes that I found more challenging. We still climbed several thousand feet per day, but the inclines were relatively gradual. This trek, instead, should be known for its panoramic views and the unique experience of hiking through these remote mountain towns.
Of course, the trip is not without risks, but they lie in unexpected places. The flights to and from Lukla are the most dangerous part of the journey. The Lukla airport has long been considered one of the most dangerous airports in the world — and in fact, a fatal crash occurred while we were there. I tried to push the knowledge of the airport’s dangers to the furthest recesses of my mind as I boarded a tiny propeller plane bound for that very place.
The plane ride is beautiful, with mountains on all sides, but the landing is enough to put even the fiercest adventurer on edge. A standard runway is between 6,000-8,000 feet long; Lukla’s is only 1,700 feet long. It’s sloped upward to help slow the plane before it hits the solid rock wall waiting at the end of it. At the other end is a 2,000-foot drop. After landing safely, we were mesmerised watching the planes taking off for Kathmandu literally fly off the edge of a cliff.
Altitude sickness is also a concern, though if you work with an experienced guiding company as we did, they will ensure you climb up slowly to acclimatise. We had two layover days and hiked a far shorter distance each day than our bodies were capable of going. This itinerary helped us grow accustomed to the air as it grew thinner.
Hiking up slowly didn’t feel like a burden, though, as it allowed extra time to take in those jaw-dropping views. The higher I climbed, the more I felt like I could reach out and touch the shimmering, snow-capped peaks. The further we progressed, the more the mountains seemed to bend toward us like we were inside of a snow globe.
At several points, we caught sight of Everest’s majestic peak peering out from behind its neighbours. Most of Everest lies in Tibet, but the peak is in Nepal. As such, the trek to Base Camp does not actually take place on Mount Everest, but inside Sagarmatha National Park — Sagarmatha being the Nepalese name for Everest.
Each day, as we made it a little higher, the air became a little thinner and our breath a little shorter. By day eight, the time between each step I took had grown significantly. I was breathing hard. My feet were dragging and my head pounding. I trudged slowly upward, but upward nonetheless, knowing the goal was within reach.
By mid-afternoon, we hiked across the final ridge and Base Camp came into view. We had made it to the gateway to the top of the world.
Base Camp rests on a massive glacier. I high-fived my group and took in the sight of dozens of yellow tents pitched across the ice, tents belonging to those preparing for their ascent. According to my trekking guide, the glacial terrain changes so rapidly that the expeditioners have to move their tents every two weeks.
We took pictures beside the sign declaring we were there and feasted on dark chocolate almond bark to celebrate. As the afternoon clouds rolled in, we lay back and watched the mountains disappear above our heads. The cheers and squeals of more trekkers arriving filled the air as it began to snow.
It may not have been the top, but it was nonetheless a spot where most people on the planet will never set foot. I feel so lucky to have stood in that very special place, and, as I always do at the end of a hike, I feel so strong knowing it was my own two feet that got me there.

Photo: AP
AMSTERDAM: The city of Amsterdam’s latest attempt to rein in the nuisance of over-tourism by banning guided tours of the red light district has run into opposition from some of the people it is intended to protect: sex workers.
The Dutch capital plans to ban such tours, saying they are disrespectful and contribute to congestion in the narrow, canal-side streets where scantily-clad sex workers sit behind windows to attract customers.
The first step in the new policy was taken Monday night in the red light district, with tours banned from 7 p.m.
On a recent Friday night, the problem was clear to see: Tourists bathed in a red glow emanating from the windows and peep shows’ neon lights were packed shoulder to shoulder as they shuffled through the alleys.
But sex workers’ union Proud questions whether banning tours will reduce tourist numbers and argues that guides educate visitors and encourage them to behave more respectfully toward the women.
“It could also be that now there are no guides that people just wander into the area themselves and gawk at the women behind the window and take photos because there is no one anymore to inform them how to behave or what the rules of the game are in this area,” said a sex worker who goes by the name of Velvet and is the advocacy coordinator for Proud. Velvet declined to give her real name, saying that because of the stigma attached to sex work, most sex workers use a working name or pseudonym to protect their privacy and safety.
Amsterdam’s Prostitution Information Center, which is housed in the same building as Proud, offers its own red light district tours.
The total ban on guided tours, which is planned to come into full force on Jan. 1, is another step in the city’s campaign to reduce the problems associated with over-tourism and part of a broader package of measures reining in tours in the city.
Bobien van Aalst of the Dutch tour guide association Guidor slammed the ban on tours, not just to the red light district but to other historic parts of the city. She said it means guides won’t be able to explain to tourists where Rembrandt van Rijn painted one of his first famous works or where the painter’s wife is buried.
“I mean it’s like in Paris if you’re forbidding (tours) to go to the Arc de Triomphe or the Eiffel Tower,” she said.
City Hall says that more than 1,000 tour groups per week now operate around the Old Church Square in the heart of the red light district.
“Yeah, there’s really over-tourism there — too crowded. I mean there were evenings where … residents basically couldn’t leave their homes anymore because the alleys were blocked,” the city’s deputy mayor, Udo Kock, told The Associated Press.
People who work in Amsterdam’s sex industry question whether there are more tourists, or whether similar numbers are squeezing into a red light district that has shrunk in recent years as hundreds of the sex workers’ windows have been shuttered in an attempt to diversify the narrow streets.
Kock acknowledges that not everybody is happy, but says many others are pleased that the city is tackling the tours.
The red light district is a tourist magnet, especially after dark, with crowds of people waiting to get into sex shows and visiting the Red Light Secrets Museum of Prostitution, where you can experience the windows from a sex worker’s perspective by sitting on a stool in front of a “window” onto which images are projected of men walking past and peering in.
The museum’s manager, Natascha Flipsen, agrees that guided tours help educate the visitors not just about the history of the centuries-old red light district, but also about how to treat the women who work there with respect.
And she says that tourism is good for the business.
For tourists, “this is like the once in a lifetime experience, so they visit the sex work as well of course,” Flipsen said.

A lighting strike is pictured from an aircraft at an area in Singapore. Photo: Skanda Gautam/THT
So, my brother, who lives in the US, was getting married. Arrange a visa, head to the States to attend the wedding — that’s a lot of work. I thought I’d just wish him from here. A few days later, a Viber group was created including me and other children from my maternal family, and all of my mother’s sisters — eight in total. Now the wedding would take place in Bali, Indonesia. Wow a ‘Destination Wedding’!
More excited than ever, I agreed that I was going. So I started saving, and yes the time finally came.
I took leave from office for 10 days, booked the tickets for my mother and me, and started packing. When I left my house and reached the airport, it didn’t feel like I was actually going to Bali, but when I sat on the plane, I realised that my journey had begun. The flight, which was pretty chilled with a couple of beers, was of around four hours to Singapore, our transit point.
Then through tough Singapore security, helped by Starbucks coffee and a coconut drink, we were finally on our way to Bali.
So Bali. What can I say? The first thing that crossed my mind is ‘hot and sweaty’. As we got the hang of the weather, we found our guide, and an hour’s drive to the villa.





The sight along the way was awesome — statues of Hindu deities were around every street and corner. And you could see beautiful hand-carved statues of Ganesha and other deities in the shops, a breathtaking scene, their faith in religion, how they worship the gods.
I later found out that they are so religious that all of Bali was closed for two days for New Year’s prayers a day before we arrived. They meditate and pray at temples and their homes.
The villa was like a dream house with a swimming pool. The first thing I did was leave my baggage and go to a local pub for some chilled beers. The most popular and loved beer was Bintang, which cost 25,000 rupiah a bottle — shocking at first, but I later realised it’s around Rs 200.
People from all over the world, especially Australians come here to surf.
The weather is humid, so you sweat like crazy. It is constant summer with no winter, and even the metrology can’t predict rainfall. So it’s mandatory to spend your day in the pool with yes, chilled beer.
The local food was amazing, and hospitality commendable. The beautiful sunset by the ocean added to our first few days making everything surreal.
We also went for Luwak coffee tasting where they give you different drinks of flavoured tea and coffee, which was all free until you wished to drink the world’s most expensive coffee — Luwak animal poop coffee. The process to extract the poop was amazing using traditional hand method of collection to packing. A small cup cost us around 350,000 million Indonesian rupiah, and to buy a small pack I spent nearly 750,000 million rupiah, a gift for my dad that equals around $80. Crazy right? And it was really strong too.
The monkey temple was cool, more like a jungle with amazing sculptures of deities and filled with monkeys, better looking than the ones from Nepal. More mature looking I must say.
Then we visited the Saroswati Temple famous for its lotus blooms. Most people come for wedding photo shoots.
I also pampered myself to a fish spa for my feet. So ticklish!
Then the big day arrived — everything had to be Nepali style, the groom in a car to the wedding temple to the attire to the wedding dance janti. People were amazed, a few even made attempts to film the wedding.
About 50 guests attended the wedding.
The temple where the wedding was held was a massive one dedicated to Lord Shiva. The rituals were in Sanskrit language and I couldn’t understand any of it! The ritual was short as compared to Nepal, the ceremony concluded in just around two hours.
My brother had hired an amazing wedding planner. The ceremony was for two days — mehendi night at our new villa by the beach with black sand, a Jacuzzi and a swimming pool and breathtaking view of the surfers. The whole night was a blast with no sleep where my phone dived into the pool and died. Sad story but …
The next day was the wedding — early morning ceremony by the ocean and janti in 1940s classic vehicle headed towards the temple where the ceremony took place. The reception took place in the evening where a Balinese fire dancer showcased all kinds of acts and fire tricks. The decoration was beautiful with all the lights reflected by the pool of our villa.
We had heard of the popular Bali swing, so the last day we spent seeing that and other sites and shopping places.
Though we had a few mishaps  — a few had their luggage arriving a day late, one bashed his head swimming at 3:00 am, one broke his leg, my aunt lost $1,200, and I dropped my phone in the pool, it was one heck of a week.
As I write this story, I still feel the wind, the ocean, my family’s laughter and the closeness we felt coming together from different parts of the world for a week, leaving our hectic lives behind to enjoy and be together in a beautiful new place and for such an auspicious occasion. It was an experience of a life time.

CYRENE, LIBYA: Graffiti covers the walls of a Greek amphitheatre in Cyrene, an ancient ruined city in eastern Libya now struggling with neglect, vandals and illegal confiscation of land by locals.
The deserted souvenir shops and cafes on the mountainous road leading to the 2,600-year-old site are the only reminders that this used to be a major tourist destination.
Looting has hit Libya’s archaeological sites since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 when the country descended into turmoil with rival administrations competing for control.
Cyrene is one of five of UNESCO’s World Heritage sites in the North African country listed for their outstanding value. Others include the ruins of the Roman city of Leptis Magna, and Sabratha, both in western Libya.
Apart from Cyrene, some 200 km (124 miles) east of Benghazi, the east of the country has the Apollonia site just 20 km away.
With tourists gone and the antiquities department complaining about budget shortages, vandals have smeared graffiti on columns and looted artefacts.
Some treasures such as heads or entire torsos of statues listed in guidebooks issued in 2011 are no longer there.
“Many artefacts have been smuggled abroad,” said Ahmad Hussein, the head of the antiquities department of a parallel administration in charge of eastern Libya.
Unable to prevent theft, his department has been registering artefacts, a process which has helped to recover some in Europe, he said.
There was better site protection before 2011, but excavation at the site, in fact, dates back to Italian rule — the colonialists’ equipment can still be seen. The last Italians left the east in 1943 following their military defeat when the region came under British administration.
“There has been a lot of destruction in recent years,” said Ismail Miftah, a farmer living next to Cyrene. “Ordinary people don’t appreciate the ancient heritage.”

KATHMANDU: Four Sherpa climbers who got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Mt Makaulu Base Camp in two-metre deep snow in Sankhuwasabha for over a week shared that the high route of the Great Himalaya Trail witnessed an unusual snowfall in this winter season.
Four climbers – Pemba Jangbu Sherps, Darinji Sherpa, Pemba Rinji Sherpa and Pasang Gelu Sherpa were rescued by a Kailash Air helicopter on Monday as they ran out of food in the mountain area while embarking on a trek namely “German Nepal Friendship: The Great Himalaya Trail in Winter”.
It was really an unusual snowfall in the region, one of the team leaders Pemba Jangbu shared.
“We had to to turn around due to heavy snow in the Barun-Valley in Sankhuwasabha this season,” he said, recounting that as this is was a friendship project between Nepal and Germany the crew continued to Barun Dobhan trying to reach the high passes – Sherpani Col 6,110m, West Col 6,100m and Amphu Labtsa 5,700m – to cross into Khumbu.
“This is not only the story of the first ever attempt of the GHT High Route in winter but a story about German-Nepali friendship,” German Geographer Hannes Kuenkel, who is also a leader of the team, added.
This year the crew regrouped and was joined by seven experienced Sherpa – Darinji, Pemba Rinji, Pasang Gelu, Dafuri, Pasang Dawa, Phurba Sonam, Pasang Tendi – from Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Municipality-1, Solokhumbu, German photographer Martin Poetter and Austrian videographer Julia Brunner.
As they started their trek from Olongchun Gola where they had to break up last time and then crossed the snowy Lumbha Samba Pass (5,175m), the team reached Arun Valley on January 11.
“As all routes up to Makulu Base Camp were very difficult we tried the High Route above Hongon up to Malun Pokhari at 4,000m and we had experienced heavy snowfall and up to two feet high snow which made it impossible to hike with heavy loads,”  Kuenkel said.
As the weather was very unpredictable and the route not marked or built the team decided to take their only chance for the High Route by splitting the group in Gadhi on January 19 and sending the four strongest Sherpas led by Pemba Jangbu with only minimum equipment and light packs via Keke La pass (4,100m) towards the high passes while the others returned to Tumlingtar and flew via Kathmandu to Namche to meet up with the crew again, according to him.
The plan was that the Germans met the Sherpa again in Khumbu and together finished the Eastern part of the GHT via the icy Trashi Labtsa Pass (5,777m).
“Unfortunately the weather became worse and the Sherpa team got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Makaulu Base Camp in up to two-metre deep snow and the crew experienced 120 hours of continuous snowfall between January 22 (1pm) and January 28 (1am).”
On January 24, the snowfall stopped for 13 hours but the helicopter could not start from Kathmandu due to bad weather there. Pemba Jangbu who led over 26 expeditions told that he never experienced this kind of snowfall before. “On 28th January, a helicopter rescue was successful. It was just in time as the crew run out of gas and food.”
This winter the extraordinarily heavy snowfall did not allow the team to continue. So the team returned to Kathmandu were they stay together as friends and already prepare plans for a next attempt, according to Kuenkel, who visited Nepal for 15 times.
The two expedition leaders Pemba Jangbu and Kuenkel mentioned that they continued this project for three reasons: to promote trekking in Nepal, make people sensitive for the consequences of global warming and demonstrating how strong and powerful the international friendship can be.
According to team members, Pemba Jangbu, also owner of IAM Trekking & Expeditions and the German Geographer Hannes met during an Everest North Side Expedition which was shattered by the big earthquake in 2015.
In January 2017 they started the first attempt of the GHT High Route in winter. As the eastern part of Nepal has the highest mountains and passes they decided to take that challenge first and go from East to West starting in Taplejung.
They went up to Pangpema BC of Kantschendzonga, crossing the Nango La (4700m) to Olangchung Gola. That year the German became heavily sick in Olangchung Gola and had to give up early.

BANGKOK: Thailand approved marijuana for medical use and research on Tuesday, the first legalisation of the drug in a region with some of the world’s strictest drug laws.
The junta-appointed parliament in Thailand, a country which until the 1930s had a tradition of using marijuana to relieve pain and fatigue, voted to amend the Narcotic Act of 1979 in an extra parliamentary session handling a rush of bills before the New Year’s holidays.
“This is a New Year’s gift from the National Legislative Assembly to the government and the Thai people,” said Somchai Sawangkarn, chairman of the drafting committee, in a televised parliamentary session.
While countries from Colombia to Canada have legalised marijuana for medical or even recreational use, the drug remains illegal and taboo across much of Southeast Asia, which has some of the world’s harshest punishments for drug law violations.
Marijuana traffickers can be subject to the death penalty in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.
But in Thailand, the main controversy with legalisation involved patent requests by foreign firms that could allow them to dominate the market, making it harder for Thai patients to access medicines and for Thai researchers to access marijuana extracts.
“We’re going to demand that the government revoke all these requests before the law takes effect,” said Panthep Puapongpan, Dean of the Rangsit Institute of Integrative Medicine and Anti-Aging.
Some Thai advocates hope that Tuesday’s approval will pave the way for legalisation for recreational use.
“This is the first baby step forward,” said Chokwan Chopaka, an activist with Highland Network, a cannabis legalisation advocacy group in Thailand.

BERLIN: More than 6 million visitors, 7.5 million liters of beer, 124 rotisserie oxen and Bill Clinton in lederhosen; another Oktoberfest in Munich has come and gone.
Festival organizers say good fall weather helped attract 100,000 more people to the annual event than last year; in all, 6.3 million from about 70 countries. That’s despite this year’s Oktoberfest running only 16 days — two fewer than in 2017.
Former US President Clinton and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showed up Friday night — he dressed in traditional Bavarian garb and she in a trademark pantsuit.
Security guards confiscated 101,000 liter-size beer mugs from sticky-fingered guests seeking souvenirs. Munich authorities cleaned up 95 tons of garbage during the festival that ended Sunday.

MEDORA: For travelers looking to visit all 50 states, North Dakota is often one of the last to be checked off. It’s not exactly on the way to anywhere else, and flying there is expensive.
It ended up being 49th on my 50-state quest (sorry, Idaho!). Part of the challenge was deciding what to do there and how to get there. I had to choose between visiting Fargo in eastern North Dakota (and the name of one of my favorite movies) or Theodore Roosevelt National Park in the west.
It’s 330 miles (530 kilometers) between them, and I didn’t have time for both on a week-long road trip that also included Montana’s Glacier National Park and Idaho’s Craters of the Moon.
In the end, Roosevelt Park won out. Photos of its badlands and prairies enchanted me, and the story of Teddy Roosevelt’s sojourn there following the deaths of his wife and mother on the same day intrigued me.
What was it about this place that allowed this future president to grieve and recover — while at the same time inspiring him to become one of America’s most influential conservationists? I needed to see it for myself.
GETTING THERE
My husband and I flew to Denver — by air from New York, the cheapest jumping-off point — and rented a car (unlimited mileage, of course). We then drove 600 miles (965 kilometers) north through Wyoming and South Dakota to the tiny North Dakota town of Medora (population 132), at the entrance to the park’s South Unit.
Fortunately, those 600 miles were easily done in a day, thanks to speed limits of 75 and 80 mph (120-128 kph) in many spots, and little traffic outside Colorado. Still, it felt like we were heading to a pretty remote place, and I wondered if the park would hold its own against national parks I’d visited in Alaska, Hawaii and the Southwest, not to mention Yellowstone and Yosemite.
About 700,000 people visit Roosevelt Park yearly, compared to the more than 3 million annual visitors at places like Montana’s Glacier Park.
THE LOOP AND WILDLIFE
Teddy Roosevelt Park is open 24 hours daily. We arrived at 7:30 a.m. one day at the tail end of last summer. Map in hand, we drove the 36-mile (58-kilometer) scenic loop around the park’s South Unit, stopping at many of the nearly 20 points of interest along the way.
Within minutes, we came upon a prairie dog town. Dozens of the tiny creatures scampered back and forth, popping in and out of little holes amid scrubby grasses. We’d see three more prairie dog towns before we completed the loop, along with wild horses grazing on a hill by the roadside and in another spot, a herd of bison.
The wildlife encounters were thrilling and unexpected surprises.
THE LANDSCAPE
The landscape was thrilling too. The scent of sage perfumed the air, and bursts of red foliage punctuated the gray-green grasslands. Stripes of peach, cream and mud-brown earth and stone lined the curving banks of the Little Missouri River.
Framing it all were the famous badlands stretching to the horizon: flat-topped stone formations with striated slopes in tawny yellows and russet reds, dotted with bright green trees and patches of grass. They looked like the crusty paws of some massive alien creature on the verge of rising up.
We did most of the hikes along the loop drive, some just a few minutes’ walk to an overlook, others 20 to 40 minutes along hilly trails covering a mile or more. At every stop, we were awed by the scenery, from the astonishing palette of earthy hues to the stone shapes etching land and sky.
ROOSEVELT’S STORY
An exhibit at the visitor center tells Roosevelt’s story. On his first visit in 1883, he hunted bison and invested in a ranch near Medora. He’d been a state assemblyman in his native New York, but after his mother and wife both died on Feb. 14, 1884, he left politics and returned to the badlands to mourn his losses.
He lived in a small ponderosa pine cabin now located just steps from the visitor center. It’s furnished with period pieces and some of his belongings, including his traveling trunk, a replica of his writing desk and a rocking chair.
Roosevelt lived the cowboy life, spending days riding and herding in what was considered America’s last frontier. His experiences there were formative: He lost more than $24,000 when blizzards decimated the cattle he’d invested in. He witnessed the environmental damage done by overgrazing. And he realized that the bison, who once roamed the plains in the millions, had dwindled to the hundreds.
Roosevelt wrote three books inspired by his Western sojourn. He eventually returned to politics, serving as New York governor and from 1901-1909, as US president. His accomplishments included the conservation of 230 million acres of land, a legacy that led to the creation of the National Park Service in 1916.
For me, Roosevelt Park ranks among the most interesting and beautiful I’ve seen. I wish I hadn’t waited so long to visit, and I hope someday to go back and absorb more of the place that Roosevelt called “a land of vast silent spaces — a place of grim beauty.”

DENPASAR, INDONESIA: The Indonesian tourist island of Bali closed its international airport Friday, stranding thousands of travelers, as the Mount Agung volcano gushed a 2,500-meter (8,200-feet) column of ash and smoke.
The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said nearly 450 flights were canceled, affecting some 75,000 people.
The regional Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Darwin, Australia, said winds would carry the ash southwest toward Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island. Volcanic ash is a potentially deadly threat to aircraft that can cause engines to “flame out.”
The volcano began belching ash and smoke on Thursday and several airlines canceled inbound and outbound flights scheduled for the evening.
“We hadn’t a place to stay for the night so we had to find something else, just took a taxi and stayed at a random hostel,” said a stranded German backpacker who identified herself as Louisa. “We hoped that we could leave this morning, but the airport is closed,” she said.
Two small airports, at Banyuwangi and Jember in eastern Java, also closed because of the ash threat.
Agung’s alert level has not been raised and an exclusion zone around the crater remains at 4 kilometers (2.5 miles).
The disaster agency said the closure of Bali’s airport is in effect until 7 p.m. It said the situation will be reviewed at midday.
Australia’s national airline Qantas said in a statement that it’s “currently not safe” to operate Bali flights.
It said it was monitoring advice from the ash advisory center and its own pilots and meteorologists would decide when flights can resume.
The volcano, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) northeast of Bali’s tourist hotspot of Kuta, last had a major eruption in 1963, killing about 1,100 people.
It had a dramatic increase in activity last year, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, but had quietened by early this year. Authorities lowered its alert status from the highest level in February.
Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Government seismologists monitor more than 120 active volcanoes.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: Once a pristine Thai paradise, the secluded bay made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie “The Beach” has been exhausted by mass tourism. Now it’s getting a break.
After Friday, the daily influx of dozens of boats and thousands of visitors unsuccessfully scrambling for an unspoiled view of Maya Bay’s emerald waters and glistening white sand will end. The attraction is being closed for four months to give its coral reefs and sea life a chance to recover.
Thailand has promoted unfettered tourism for decades and the onslaught on Maya Bay, which is on Phi Phi Leh Island in the Andaman Sea, has only picked up pace in recent years. Authorities now say they are striving to balance profit and conservation and the closure will happen every year.
It is part of a rethink happening globally about unrestricted tourism that brings in big dollars but damages historic sites, harms the environment and often alienates locals.
Last month, the Philippines began a six-month closure of popular Boracay Island, whose waters President Rodrigo Duterte described as a “cesspool.” Venice, the famed Italian lagoon city that lives off tourism, installed gates at two access bridges during a four-day holiday in April so it could turn back visitors if numbers became overwhelming.
Many of Thailand’s marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October during the monsoon season but because of Maya Bay’s popularity, it hasn’t had a break since a Hollywood crew set foot on its sands in 1999 to film the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland. Its corals have been decimated by the suffocating clouds of sand and sediment churned up by speedboats.
“I tried to push this campaign for many, many years, but you know in Thailand we are a tourism industry country and we need a lot of money, so before not so many people listened,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine biologist and member of a government committee on development and the environment.
“It should have been done 10 years ago but at least it has been done,” he said.
Thailand had about 35 million international visitors last year, a five-fold increase in little more than two decades.
Shi Pengfei, among the last tourists to visit Maya Bay before its closure, said he had no idea that there would be so many people on the beach.
“I feel that there are so many people here,” said Shi, from Henan, China. “The government’s plan to close off the beach for a few months is only natural because the ocean needs a break, a chance to recover, so that the next generation can have a better and even more beautiful destination.”
But locals aren’t entirely happy. The head of the Phi Phi Tourist Business Association, Watrapol Jantharo, said he was surprised when the closure was announced in March by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
He said locals were under the impression that Maya Bay would only be closed to boats, while visitors would still walk to the bay from the other side of the island.
“We are not against protecting our environment,” he said. “We know full well that Maya Bay is our important resource, like a rice field to a farmer, but we wish there are more communications about the government’s plan before the decision was made.”
Thon, however, said the plan was discussed with locals for three years before a decision was made.
“In the past, we made some mistake because we think that the money is very important. But now we are trying to change our idea,” he said. Overseas visitors are “very important to our country, but the most important thing is our national resource. We have to preserve and hand it to the next generation.”
The government has set a limit of 2,000 tourists a day when the bay reopens — about half the current number. Boats will no longer be allowed to anchor but must dock on the opposite side of the island.
“Now that the government has this plan, we can’t change it. But we could use this opportunity to tell the world that we do not just have Maya Bay. There are 10 other beautiful beaches and islands around here that tourists can enjoy,” said Watrapol.
Thailand’s efforts to protect certain islands after decades of unregulated tourism began about three years ago under the current military junta, which has banned the types of protests such moves may have sparked had they been announced by civilian governments.
Yoong Island, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Tachai Island in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off-limits to tourists since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said he was amazed by the results. Waters that were devoid of fish are now teeming, he said, and there is about 10,000 square meters (107,600 square feet) of newly recovered coral off one of the islands.
At Maya Bay, park rangers have been preparing a coral propagation program, attaching it to rocks that will be placed in the bay once the tourists are gone.
“We’re almost certain that something good will happen in Maya Bay,” Thon said.

BANGKOK: The daily hordes of tourists have exhausted the Thai beach made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie.
Maya Bay, on Phi Phi Leh island in the Andaman Sea, will be closed to all visitors for four months annually starting this June to allow for the recovery of the battered coral reefs and sea life. The decision to keep visitors away was made Wednesday by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
“It’s like someone who has been working for decades and has never stopped,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a prominent marine scientist and member of Thailand’s national strategy committee on environment development. “Overworked and tired, all the beauty of the beach is gone. We need a timeout for the beach.”
Many Thai marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October, but because of tourist demand, Maya Bay has remained open year-round since a Hollywood crew set foot there in 1999 to film “The Beach,” the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland.
The beach receives an average of 200 boats and 4,000 visitors each day. Recent surveys by a team led by marine biologists found a large part of the coral reefs around the area is gone and sea life has virtually disappeared.
Other Southeast Asian beach resorts are under threat too.
In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has vowed to close Boracay, a small central island popular for its powdery white sand beaches and vibrant nightlife, saying it has become a “cesspool.”
“Their waste would go directly to the ocean. The germ content is already very high there,” Duterte said last week. “It only looks good because of the white coastline.”
His top environmental officials say Boracay may be closed in the last week of April after a 30-day notice is issued and the tropical island placed under a state of calamity to allow the government to extend emergency funds to affected villagers and establishments.
During the closure, which could last six months or less, a massive cleanup is planned and noncompliant beach resorts and other establishments would have to install waste treatment and disposal systems to halt further contamination. Boracay drew more than 1 million tourists last year mostly from Asia, the United States and Europe.
Boracay officials may face administrative cases for allowing environmental laws to be breached for years and for failing to regulate the influx of tourists beyond the island’s capacity.
Thon said the Thai beach’s temporary closing will kick-start the rehabilitation process.
“If you ask me if it is too late to save our islands, the answer is no. But if we don’t do something today, it will be too late,” said Thanya Netithammakum, head of the National Parks and Wildlife Department.
When Maya Bay reopens, the department will set a daily limit of 2,000 tourists, while boats will no longer be allowed to anchor there and will have to dock on the opposite side of the island at floating piers.
The number of visitors the beach has been seeing is unsustainable, and a temporary closure is better than nothing, Thon said.
“The locals know that and we all know that,” he said. “This would be a good way to start managing our tourist destinations. And we can improve on what we learn after the first year. We know that it’s important we manage our resources well. It’s not about more numbers of tourists but about sustainable tourism that benefit locals as well.”
More than 35 million tourists visited Thailand last year, compared to around 10 million when “The Beach” premiered in 2000.
Thai authorities have in the past closed off islands ruined by mass tourism. Koh Yoong, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Koh Tachai, in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off limits to tourists permanently since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said the results have been amazing. Areas with a bleak sea life environment and coral bleaching are now teeming with robust and colorful sea life and coral, he said. He’s certain that the annual closure will also help restore Maya Bay.
“I have always dreamt that one day we could work to bring her back to life. I have been following and working on Maya Bay for more than 30 years. I had seen it when it was a heaven and I see it when it has nothing left. Anything that we can do to bring this paradise back to Thailand is the dream of a marine biologist,” he said.

IFEROUANE: Tuaregs in northern Niger are hoping to draw tourists back to the region by putting their traditional dances, music poetry and camel races on display.
Despite concerns about Islamic extremism throughout the Sahel region in West Africa, organizers recently hosted more than 1,000 visitors to a cultural festical in Iferouane, a village in Niger’s far north.
“Without tourism, our youth risks falling into idleness and misery, and will join the wave of migration to Europe,” said Mohamed Houma, the mayor of the town located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the central city of Agadez.
The Air festival, considered one of the most important gatherings to celebrate the culture of the Tuareg people, has been held since 2001.
It was marked last month by the sound of tende, the Tuareg style of music and drumming, as the women and men, on foot and on their camels, participated in song and dance competitions.
Since 2001, the gatherings have been held to celebrate the culture of the semi-nomadic Tuareg people. More than 2 million Tuaregs live in the Sahara Desert area, stretching across Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria and Tunisia.
Niger’s Air region, with oases, mountains and sand dunes, has been a destination for adventurous Western tourists since the 1980s and the visitors have been a financial boon for the region. But the tourism has dwindled since the Tuareg rebellion, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, and from the proliferation of armed and extremist groups in the Sahel region.
Security guards watched over the dozen French and Belgian tourists who participated this year’s in Air Festival.
“We are very happy because this festival shows the rest of the world that despite the international geopolitical and security context, we live here in peace, sheltered from the upheavals of some of our neighboring countries,” Houma said.
French tourists to the festival this year included Jacques Maire, a French legislator who heads a France-Niger Friendship group in the French National Assembly.
While the situation in Niger is tense, he said it is not the worst in the region.
“There has always been a strong French appetite for the Sahara,” said Maire. “We must seize every opportunity to recreate tourist flows.”

PHOENIX: Arizona officials on Friday guaranteed that Grand Canyon National Park will remain in full operation if Congress fails to pass a budget and a government shutdown ensues.
Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said the state’s top tourist attraction “will not close on our watch, period.”
Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak says the state’s parks and tourism agencies plan to provide up to $100,000 to ensure lodging, campgrounds and restaurants remain open, and more funding if needed.
The state agencies have been working with the National Park Service to plan for a possible shutdown as early as Saturday if Congress fails to pass a government funding bill. The House passed a temporary government funding bill Thursday night, but the Senate was deadlocked.
President Donald Trump and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer met Friday afternoon in an eleventh-hour effort to avert a shutdown. The impasse is over federal spending and legislation to protect some 700,000 younger immigrants from deportation.
“If Washington, D.C. won’t function, Arizona will,” Ducey said in a statement. “Don’t change your travel plans, because Arizona is open for business — regardless of what happens back in Congress.”
The U.S. Interior Department said national parks and other public lands will remain as accessible as possible if a shutdown happens. That’s a change from previous shutdowns, when most parks were closed and became high-profile symbols of dysfunction.
But spokeswoman Heather Swift said services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds, full-service restrooms and concessions won’t be operating in most locations.
Arizona’s decision to guarantee funding to cover the cost of those services means they should operate at the Grand Canyon as normal if a shutdown occurs.
Arizona paid about $100,000 a day to cover the full cost of keeping the Grand Canyon open during the last shutdown in 2013 but was eventually reimbursed by the federal government. Former Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, worked to pay the National Park Service $651,000 to keep the popular tourist destination open for a week. That came after a shutdown that lasted more than a week.
Federal lawmakers reached an agreement on the budget before those seven days were up.
During a 1995 shutdown, Arizona’s governor famously led a convoy of unarmed troops to the park’s gate to demand it be opened.
They were met there by the park superintendent, who negotiated with then-Gov. Fife Symington, a Republican, for a partial reopening if the budget impasse continued.
The shutdown was briefly solved, but when the parks were again closed a month later, the state paid more than $17,000 a day to keep the road to the Grand Canyon Village and the Mather Point scenic viewpoint on the canyon’s South Rim open.

LAMJUNG: A number of domestic tourists visiting a historical site of Rainaskot in Lamjung district has increased significantly.
Home stay, started after renovation of an earthquake affected houses are now packed with the domestic tourists. It is being run in a total of 14 houses which are built with the modern techniques where 84 tourists can be accommodated at once.
The concept of home stay in Rainaskot begun with American national Natasha Wajniyak providing a fund of Rs 20.75 million to renovate the quake affected houses according to Sarbodaya Old Age Home’s Chairperson Krishna Raj Oliya.
One of the home stay entrepreneurs in Rainaskot, Dilmaya Gurung informed that the domestic tourists are also provided the opportunities of observing the local cultural programs during their stay.
“Besides, tasting the local organic foods, domestic tourists also can experience the local cultures,” said Gurung. Since the Rainaskot has a big Gurung population, a museum related to that caste also has been established.
Meanwhile Rainaskot Tourism Committee’s Chairperson Khadak Bahadur Gurung expressed his hope of attracting even bigger number of the domestic tourists in the future. Visitors can reach the site after two hours of bus ride and three hours of hike from Paudi, a gateway of Lamjung district.
Mesmerizing views of 18 mountain ranges including Annapurna and Machchapuchhre can be seen from the Rainaskot.

MADRID, SPAIN:  A passenger on a delayed Ryanair flight from London who apparently got fed up waiting to get off a plane after it landed in the southern Spanish city of Malaga surprised fellow passengers by using the emergency exit to jump onto a wing.
The incident on New Year’s Day took place 30 minutes after the flight from Stansted Airport landed.
The man, who has not been named but is said to be a non-Spanish citizen, was coaxed back onto the plane while police were called.
Fellow passenger Fernando del Valle Villalobos, who videoed the incident, said he heard the man say he got fed up waiting.
“I was astonished,” del Valle, 25, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
He said the passengers were standing in the aisle waiting to get off the plane when the man “very calmly asked permission to get past, opened the emergency exit, looked out, saw the wing, went back for his back-pack.”
Later, he said the captain came out and asked the man why he had done it and del Valle heard him say clearly that he was sick of waiting inside. The passengers, except the man in question, were kept a further 15 minutes on the plane before being let off.
Police said Wednesday that they have opened a complaint against the man for breaching security.
Ryanair said the incident was now in the hands of Spanish authorities.

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA: While much of the nation shivers in bone-aching cold, people in Alaska’s largest city are basking in warmer weather, jogging in short sleeves, ice-skating in T-shirts or walking dogs while just lightly bundled up.
Anchorage saw an official high of 44 degrees Tuesday, tying the record set in 1981 and 2011. That was warm enough for Patricia Bierer, who was visiting Alaska this winter from Montana.
“I am from the Bitterroot Valley in Montana, and it’s colder there today than it is here in Alaska,” said Bierer, dressed in a pink parka as she strolled with family members around Anchorage’s Westchester Lagoon. “And my children that are there are jealous because I’ve got 40-degree temperatures here.”
National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Kurtz said areas of high and low pressure are working together to push tropical air to the north. But temperatures are expected to begin dropping Tuesday night, and below freezing by Wednesday. That freeze-thaw vacillation should bring slick conditions to the area.
“I jokingly refer to it as freezy, skid stuff,” Kurtz said.
It comes as the weather service issued wind chill advisories and freeze warnings covering a vast area, from South Texas to Canada and from Montana to Maine.

A large swath of the US is freezing under Alaska-like weather, but parts of the nation’s northernmost state itself are basking in balmy conditions. Tuesday’s official temperature hit a record 45 degrees in Anchorage. (Jan. 2)

The unseasonable temperatures brought Anchorage resident Cassandra Sullivan out to walk her pit bull Athena along downtown streets. She said it helped jolt her out of the winter blues.
“For some reason, with the weather out today as it is and just the breeze and the warm air, it kind of brings me out of it,” she said.
Ashley Durst, walking her dog at the downtown lagoon during her lunch break, admitted that the warmer weather was a little unusual because it can be minus-30 this time of the year.
But she doesn’t mind that others are feeling that bite instead. “I just think maybe it’s time they get their little taste of it for a while,” she said with a smile.

LAS VEGAS: Las Vegas welcomed 2018 with fireworks, big-ticket musical acts and unprecedented security in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in US modern history just three months ago.
Law enforcement officers kept a close eye Monday on the estimated 330,000 people who traveled from all over the US and beyond to pack in the Las Vegas Strip and downtown’s Fremont Street. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had every officer working throughout the weekend and was aided by the Nevada National Guard and federal agents.
Rosy-cheeked visitors took selfies and livestreamed the celebration amid temperatures in the mid-40s (4 Celsius), much warmer than most of the US. They wore glittery hats, tiaras and other 2018-themed paraphernalia as they hugged and cheered on the new year.
“One bad incident is not going to deter us from having a good time,” Honolulu resident Pettra Stark, who planned her trip after the Oct. 1 shooting, said while standing underneath the massive video canopy on Fremont Street.
For Stark, the heavy presence of armed officers was reassuring. But not everyone felt the same way, including Adrian Dominguez, who traveled for the festivities with 10 other relatives.
“It’s not pleasant to see so many officers,” Dominguez, a resident of the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Juarez. “They are everywhere.”
The heightened security comes after a high-stakes gambler killed 58 and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below before killing himself.
On Saturday, two security guards were fatally shot while investigating a disturbance at Arizona Charlie’s Decatur, a hotel-casino just west of the Strip. Police said the suspect was hospitalized with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities described it as an isolated incident and assured that it was not terrorism-related.
A roughly eight-minute fireworks display at the top of seven of the city’s world-famous casino-hotels started at the Stratosphere 10 seconds before midnight Monday and continued to Venetian, Treasure Island, Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Aria and MGM Grand. More than 80,000 pyrotechnic firings that illuminated the sky in gold, red and green.
Megastars performed at venues up and down the Strip. The Foo Fighters played at The Chelsea at The Cosmopolitan, Maroon 5 was at the Mandalay Bay Events Center and Britney Spears performed at The Axis at Planet Hollywood.
At a lower-key celebration in downtown Las Vegas’ casino-flanked Fremont Street Experience, bands played under a massive video canopy while visitors danced and sipped giant beers.
Las Vegas police officer Larry Hadfield on Monday said there were no incidents related to the festivities to speak of. The Nevada Highway Patrol on Twitter reported the arrest of two suspected impaired drivers near the Strip.
Police cruisers, dump trucks and other large vehicles blocked key intersections during the night to try to prevent anyone from plowing into crowds.
Strollers, backpacks, large bags, coolers and glass bottles were banned from the Strip for the night. Ticket holders for the celebration on Freemont Street Experienced went through checkpoints where security guards used hand-held metal detectors.
New Year’s Eve is worth an estimated $254.3 million to Las Vegas, according to the city’s Convention and Visitors Authority. More than 97 percent of the destination’s nearly 149,000 hotel and motel rooms were expected to be booked.

Canada is more than just its great mountains, wild moose-spotting road trips and craggy-coast good looks. Its endless variety of landscapes might keep you busy the first few days but what would a traveller look for beyond the great outdoors? Its captivating culture will engulf you; from west to east, a foodie’s paradise your palates would be thoroughly refreshed and thriving cities with their own artistic flair will surprise you. But if you’re looking to weave stories out of adventures for years to come here are a few places that you must check out.

Venture into the woods

If snuggled in a sphere suspended atop the forest canopy of Vancouver Island in the middle of nowhere is what excites you then a visit to the Free Spirit Spheres is a must. It’s part Middle Earth fantasy and part childhood dream, you’ll find large wooden orbs suspended from the trees. Take the spiral staircase and short suspension bridge leading up to them and enter into the sphere to experience nature from a different perspective.
Designed to look vaguely like enormous nuts or seeds, the cedar and spruce spheres borrow from and collaborate with the surrounding environment. The spheres are made of fibreglass and wood, and borrow heavily from sailboat construction methods. Inside the curving walls complete with portholes for windows, space is maximised with fold-out tables and mirrors, curved loft beds and benches, and tiny appliances. Touted as ‘the ultimate tree-house experience,’ these Free Spirit Spheres can be rented overnight.

Brace yourself

Mazes and labyrinths reached its zenith as a form in Renaissance England, more as a device for
entertainment than serious purpose. Today VanDusen Garden in Vancouver is one of only six in North America.
It carries on the tradition of Elizabethan hedge mazes in North America. The maze is made of 3,000 pyramidal cedars — Thuja occidentalis ‘Fastigiata’ to be specific was planted in the autumn of 1981 and slowly grown into the form of the maze one finds today.
Named after local lumber magnate and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen, this garden is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. In addition to the maze, the gardens cover 55 acres and displays plants from around the world. There is an observation terrace from which the less adventuresome visitor can view the maze and the struggles of its confused occupants.

For your eyes only

A book collector’s dream, The Monkey’s Paw in Toronto has the world’s first ‘Biblio-Mat’, a
random book vending machine.  All of the books lining the shelves of Stephen Fowler’s bookstore are ones you couldn’t possibly find anywhere else. He opened The Monkey’s Paw in March 2006 and since then it has been a haven for antiquarians, complete with
medical drawings on the wall and a stuffed crow on a typewriter.
The unusual store, named after a horror short story by author WW Jacobs, has a diverse range of old books. Fowler selects each book to fit these categories: the beautiful, the arcane, the macabre and the absurd. For some its charm may be the custom-made Biblio-Mat, a vending machine that will dispense a randomly selected vintage volume for $2, a surprise you might want to see for yourself.

Fairytale escape

An old world fairytale-land with over 350 fairy folk figurines hidden amongst 800-year old cedars is something that will surely lure you in. Artist Doris Needham and her husband Ernest needed a place to put her hand-sculpted cement creations, so they bought a forest in British Columbia and filled it with enchanted figures from fairytales and nursery rhymes.
When Rogers Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needhams’ unusual haven; one just cannot drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house.
The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage, or a favourite
nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. Take the Nature Walk, a 2-km walk through the lush Canadian forest, where you’ll discover many trees, including an 800-year-old cedar grove. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest tree house in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old
cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.

Jewel in the crown

As their contribution to Montreal’s 1967 World’s Fair Exposition the United States government
commissioned architect, scientist, and well-known genius Buckminster Fuller to design a pavilion for the Canadian exhibition.
Fuller, who popularised, perfected, and named the Geodesic Dome, designed a 20-storey-tall dome in the fashion of his hallmark design to represent the USA. Done in a full two-thirds sphere, rather than the typical half dome, the massive steel structure was seen and admired by over 5.6 million visitors who went into the dome to see exhibits from actual spaceships from the Apollo missions to American works of art.  The dome’s steel skeleton was fitted with a clear acrylic covering, making the structure look like a massive, glittering jewel.
When the fair ended, the pavilion remained, securing the dome’s place in Montreal’s landscape. This relic of the 67 Expo survived fire and ice; it was reopened and was re-purposed as a museum devoted to environmental action. Today the Biosphere of Montreal remains, a sturdy and beautiful example of ‘Bucky’s’ geodesic architecture.

Work of art

Comprised of 15,000 tonnes of snow and 500,000 tonnes of ice, the Hôtel de Glace is a massive undertaking, a stunning yet ephemeral work of art and architecture entirely built of snow and ice. Every winter, this unique hotel is completely redesigned and rebuilt, offering an unforgettable experience in the only hotel of its kind in North America.
Whether for a guided tour, a Nordic overnight stay, a wedding or a private function, the Hôtel de Glace is sure to dazzle visitors with its unique style and spellbinding décor. Guests can choose to enjoy a cocktail served in a glass made of ice or spend the night in one of the 44 theme rooms and suites and relax in the outdoor hot tubs and sauna.
Every inch of the hotel is created out of ice, including the furniture. To make the rooms more liveable, beds are covered with furs, blankets and sleeping bags tested to arctic temperatures. Although you might not get four-star service, the attraction has seduced over a million people around the world since its opening in 2001. Only 4-km from the north end of Québec City
a visit might just add to your Canada experience.  – Compiled

The Nepal Tourism Board  released the song ‘Chahara – ma’ last week to promote tourism in Nepal.
Penned by Nepal’s renowned poet, Viplob Pratik, and sung by  Nhyoo Bajracharya, who also composed it, the song was filmed in different parts of the country. The song reflects the country’s diverse topography with one of the world’s most varying altitudes.
The song has been directed by Soorya Baral, who also performs in the video. Director Baral believes that the song and music video such as this one, and the first of its kind, will no doubt give boost to the domestic tourism in Nepal once it is disseminated properly.

396,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/to-skirt-police-restrictions-some-indian-protesters-take-a-page-from-hong-kong-and-beyond/,"NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: Before midnight on New Year’s Eve, a call to action was sent on a private WhatsApp group – within the hour, dozens gathered in the centre of the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, many holding banners to protest a controversial new citizenship law.
Police quickly dispersed the group and briefly detained six people, but for Syed Faheem – who formed the WhatsApp group – it marked another successful flash protest, inspired by tactics used by protesters in Hong Kong.
Faheem, a software consultant, is one of a growing group of opponents to the new law who have begun to borrow tactics used in protests from Hong Kong to Paris, to protest legislation that critics say discriminates against Muslims.
In Hyderabad, some protesters say it is impossible to secure police permission to hold demonstrations, forcing them to adopt new tactics to show dissent.
“The objective is to get 30 minutes at one spot. Some people support us, others come and argue with us,” said Faheem, who has organised regular flash protests through WhatsApp messages that are amplified via social media.
The location of the protests, which change daily, are posted just an hour or two in advance, with the exact spots shared just minutes ahead of time.
Hyderabad’s police chief Anjani Kumar told Reuters people are being permitted to gather in areas such as sports grounds, or indoor auditoriums to protest, but added: “We’ve not given permission for any rally or procession because that affects traffic.”
‘BE WATER’
In Hong Kong, where anti-government demonstrations have raged on for months, protesters adopted a “be water” strategy, inspired by martial arts legend Bruce Lee, popping up in different locations almost daily to catch authorities flat-footed.
Sharjeel Imam, who helped organise a New Delhi sit-in protest against the new law that has run for weeks, said he plans to adopt the flash mob strategy to keep the agitation going.
In Hyderabad, the idea to copy Hong Kong‘s play-book came as protestors sought ways to run a long-term campaign that police would find hard to curb, two members from Faheem’s group said.
“Hong Kong has been pivotal….It was very inspiring,” said a 30-year-old IT professional, who declined to be identified.
After police restricted protests in another southern city, students at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore took inspiration from 2015 protests in Paris where shoes were put on display – in place of cancelled protests – to support action against climate change. Students also borrowed ideas from the 1975 protests against the imposition of an emergency in India.
“Police weren’t letting us place placards with any messages, so we copied what the press did in 1975 and left blank placards with ‘Concerned Citizens of IIM-Bangalore’ written on them,” a student involved in the protest said.
“Generations later, when they ask us what we did when they came for the Muslims, I at least want to be able to say – ‘We tried'”, she said.

397,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/1-fatally-stabbed-3-hurt-in-morning-attack-in-austin-texas/,"AUSTIN, TEXASL: A man stabbed two people, one fatally, inside a restaurant during a violent string of attacks Friday at a shopping plaza in Texas’ capital city that began with an assault at a coffee shop and ended with the suspect leaping off a roof, police said.
The attacks on a busy downtown avenue of restaurants and apartments just south of the Texas Capitol terrified customers stopping for their morning coffee on the way to work. It was the city of Austin’s first homicide of 2020.

It began when the alleged attacker, who police only identified as a 27-year-old male, struck a person inside the coffee shop “for no apparent reason,” according to Austin police. He then fled a few doors down to Freebirds World Burrito, where he stabbed two people before escaping to the roof and jumping.
By Friday night, police said the wounded person was in stable but serious condition, and the suspect was in critical condition.
“This guy out of nowhere just hit him in the back of the head with something,” said Stacy Romine, 33, who was getting her drink at Bennu Coffee when she saw the attack at a table full of regulars. “People tried to restrain him and stop him from leaving the store after it happened. But he could not be apprehended by three men, including a police officer.”
Authorities said both stabbing victims worked at the restaurant. Emergency responders described the person who died as a man in his 20s.
Hours after the attack, Republican Texas Gov Greg Abbott speculated on Twitter  that the attacker was homeless with a criminal record, fanning an ongoing feud  with Austin’s liberal leaders over people living on the streets. Police, however, have publicly offered few details on the suspect, and Abbott spokesman John Wittman would not comment beyond the governor’s tweet.
Last year, Austin relaxed ordinances on public camping, a move that made homelessness more visible downtown. Abbott has previously shared videos that he claims captures the dangers of the new policy, but they include videos criticized as misleading, including one of a man whose attorney later said wasn’t homeless and suffered from mental illness.
Austin Mayor Steve Adler said Friday night he didn’t know the stabbing suspect’s housing situation but called the governor’s tweet disappointing, saying it suggested that the homeless are dangerous.
“It’s harmful to a community when we demonize people like that falsely, misleading. There’s a real price,” Adler said.
In 2017, one student was killed and three others wounded in a random stabbing attack at the University of Texas campus in Austin. In that case, the assailant was later found not guilty by reason of insanity.

SEOUL: A group of 11 North Koreans who were detained in Vietnam while seeking to defect to South Korea have been released thanks to the help of European institutions, a Seoul-based activist group said on Saturday.
The eight women and three men were caught by border guards in northern Vietnam in late November after crossing from China, and had been held in the northeastern border city of Lang Son.

Peter Jung, who heads the group helping the refugees, Justice for North Korea, said they were freed and on their way to South Korea last month.
Multiple European organisations played a key role, he said. He declined to identify them due to the diplomatic sensitivity but said they included a non-government group.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that US officials, including diplomats engaged in denuclearisation talks with North Korea, intervened to secure the defectors’ release, citing unidentified sources.
But Jung said he was unaware of any US contribution.
South Korea’s foreign ministry said the government made immediate efforts to prevent the defectors from being forcibly repatriated, but refused to elaborate.
“The European institutions acted after we published a video of the refugees making desperate appeals for freedom,” Jung said. “The South’s foreign ministry got also involved later.”
Jung had distributed a video of some of the 11 protesting against deportation before appearing to faint.
About 33,000 North Koreans have resettled in the affluent, democratic South. Most risked their lives to cross the border in a journey that may entail persecution and slave labour, if caught and repatriated.
As living examples of some of Pyongyang’s worst abuses, defectors have long been the public face of campaigns to pressure Pyongyang to change its ways.
But South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been criticised by groups like Jung’s for not helping defectors enough and ignoring human rights issues as promotes rapprochement with the North.
In November, after brief questioning, South Korea expelled two North Korean fishermen calling them criminals who murdered 16 colleagues before crossing the border into the South.
A coalition of defector groups issued a joint statement criticising the decision, saying the men should have been tried in the South because they would likely face torture, and possibly execution back home.

Salvador Romero said both presidential and parliamentary elections would be held on the same day.
“When we announce the electoral calendar over the next few days, together with the formal call for the election, all the deadlines that both political organisations and citizens must meet will be specified,” he told reporters in La Paz.

The vote will be held almost seven months after the results of elections that handed a fourth term to Bolivia‘s former President Evo Morales but were then discredited.
An audit of last October’s election found serious irregularities, prompting Morales’ resignation and clashes between protesters and security forces that resulted in more than 30 deaths.
Morales, who had been in power for nearly 14 years, resigned following the election dispute and fled to Mexico, and later Argentina. He later said he had been toppled in a coup.
In an interview with Reuters last week, he ruled out standing as a candidate for his Movement for Socialism (MAS) coalition in the next election, but said that he would return to Bolivia by next Christmas.
He has identified Luis Arce Catacora, his former economy minister, and Andronico Rodriguez, a coca farmer union boss, as potential MAS presidential candidates.
Prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for Morales on charges of sedition, terrorism and terrorist financing. The allegations have been pushed by the government of interim President Jeanine Anez, a former senator and political opponent of Morales.

JAKARTA: Nearly 175,000 people remain displaced in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta and nearby towns, after flash floods and landslides killed at least 53 people, amid some of the heaviest rain since records began, authorities said on Saturday.
“The death toll has risen to 53 people, with one person missing,” disaster mitigation agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said.
Data from the disaster mitigation agency showed 173,064 residents remain evacuated from their homes on Saturday, after the deadliest flooding in years caused chaos in parts of Southeast Asia’s biggest city, with train lines blocked and power outages in some areas.






Swathes of Jakarta and nearby towns were inundated after heavy rain fell on Dec. 31 and into the early hours of New Year’s Day.
The deluge at the start of 2020 was “one of the most extreme rainfall” events since records began in 1866, the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said on Friday.
The agency said climate change had increased the risk of extreme weather and warned that heavy rainfall could last until mid-February, with Jan. 11-15 an expected peak.
Television footage showed flood waters inundating parts of Jakarta and mud-covered cars, some piled on top of each other.
Jakarta and its surroundings are home to more than 30 million people. More than 50 people died in one of the capital’s deadliest floods in 2007 and five years ago much of the centre of the city was inundated after canals overflowed.

Religious documents including a copy of the Koran were found among the man’s belongings, but there was no evidence the man had been influenced by radical Islamists, a spokesman for prosecutors said.
The attacker had a history of mental illness, had been admitted to hospital a few months ago, and was undergoing a course of psychiatric treatment, the spokesman said.

The attack happened in the town of Villejuif, about 8 km (5 miles) south of central Paris. Police cordoned off the area, and ambulances and police vehicles lined a road approaching the park.
The attack comes as the French capital has been rocked by major attacks resulting in mass casualties in the past four years.
The two injured victims were being treated in nearby hospitals, Laure Beccuau, the prosecutor whose office is handling the case, told reporters.
“The suspect tried to attack other victims during his murderous spree, who were able to escape,” she said.
Laurent Nunez, the deputy interior minister, visited the scene and said the attacker likely would have hurt more people if police had not shot him when they did. “It was an extremely courageous act,” Nunez said of the police response.
The prosecutor’s spokesman said the attacker, identified only as Nathan C., was born in 1997 in Lilas, a northeastern suburb of Paris.
One witness described hearing the attacker shout “Allahu Akbar,” or “God is great,” during the knife attack in the park, according to the spokesman.
But he said: “We don’t have evidence that would allow us to suppose there has been a radicalisation.” The man was not known to domestic intelligence services and had no criminal record, the spokesman said.
During the attack, the man first targeted a woman. The woman’s spouse intervened to protect her, and in the process he was fatally stabbed. The woman was not gravely wounded, the spokesman said.
In October last year, four people were stabbed to death at the Paris police headquarters by Mickael Harpon, an IT specialist working for the police. Prosecutors said that Harpon, who was shot dead by police, had come under the sway of radical Islamists.
Coordinated bombings and shootings by Islamist militants in November 2015 at the Bataclan theatre and other locations around Paris killed 130 people in the deadliest attacks in France since World War Two.

Trump says he ordered killing to prevent war, not start one
Iran’s leader vows harsh revenge
Oil prices rise $3
US embassy urges citizens to leave Iraq
European allies voice concern 

BAGHDAD/WASHINGTON: Iran promised vengeance after a US airstrike in Baghdad on Friday killed Qassem Soleimani, Tehran’s most prominent military commander and the architect of its growing influence in the Middle East.
Soleimani, a 62-year-old general who headed the overseas arm of the Revolutionary Guards, was regarded as the second most powerful figure after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The overnight attack, authorised by US President Donald Trump, was a major escalation in a “shadow war” in the Middle East between Iran and the United States and American allies, principally Israel and Saudi Arabia.
A senior Trump administration official said the general had been planning imminent attacks on US personnel across the Middle East. Democratic critics said the order by the Republican president was reckless and that he had raised the risk of more violence in a dangerous region.
“Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel but we caught him in the act and terminated him,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war.”
Trump said the United States was not seeking regime change in Iran, but that Tehran must end what he called its aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters.
A top US general cautioned that the plot by Soleimani could still happen despite his death. US officials said Washington was sending nearly 3,000 more troops to the Middle East, joining roughly 750 sent to Kuwait this week.
The attack, which also killed a top Iraqi militia commander and adviser to Soleimani, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, divided Iraqi opinion.
Many condemned the attacks, seeing Soleimani as a hero for his role in defeating the Islamic State militant group. Others voiced approval, saying Soleimani and Muhandis had backed the use of force against unarmed anti-government protesters last year and established militias that demonstrators blame for many of Iraq’s social and economic woes.
However, many Iraqis criticised Washington for killing the men on Iraqi soil and possibly plunging Iraq into another war.
Iraq’s Popular Mobilisation Forces umbrella grouping of paramilitary groups said that early on Saturday in Baghdad, air strikes targeting its fighters hit a convoy carrying its medics near Taji stadium.
An Iraqi army source said six people were killed and three wounded. State TV reported that it was carried out by the United States. There was no immediate confirmation from Washington.
There had been a sharp increase in US-Iranian hostilities last week when pro-Iranian militia attacked the US Embassy in Baghdad following a deadly US air raid on the Kataib Hezbollah militia, founded by Muhandis.
Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said with Friday’s attack Washington had breached Iraq’s sovereignty and violated a deal for keeping US troops there.

INTELLIGENCE OPERATION
Two Iraqi security sources said the attack followed an intelligence operation in which inside sources recruited by the CIA revealed the timing of Soleimani‘s arrival in Baghdad and his convoy leaving the airport.
Khamenei said harsh revenge awaited the “criminals” who killed Soleimani and his death would redouble resistance against the United States and Israel. He called for three days of national mourning.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the attack was an act of “international terrorism” and Iran would take legal action to hold Washington to account.
US officials said Soleimani was killed in a drone strike. Iran said he died in an attack by US helicopters.
Israel put its army on high alert and US allies in Europe including Britain, France and Germany voiced concerns.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was disappointed by the reaction of Washington’s European allies. “The Europeans haven’t been as helpful as I wish that they could be,” Pompeo told Fox News. “The Brits, the French, the Germans all need to understand that what we did, what the Americans did, saved lives in Europe as well,” he said.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for “maximum restraint.”
In a letter to Guterres and the UN Security Council, Iran said it reserved the right under international law to self-defense and that Soleimani‘s killing “by any measure, is an obvious example of State terrorism.”
Iran’s top Arab foe, Saudi Arabia, urged restraint. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Pompeo on a phone call that the killing “grossly violates international law” and would lead to serious consequences for regional peace and stability, according to a ministry statement.
The US embassy in Baghdad urged American citizens to leave Iraq immediately, and dozens of US citizens working for foreign oil companies in the southern city of Basra left. The evacuations would not affect output and exports, Iraqi officials said.
Oil prices jumped more than $3 a barrel over concern about disruption to Middle East supplies.

‘STICK OF DYNAMITE’
The United States and its allies have suspended training of Iraqi forces due to the increased threat they face, the German military said in a letter seen by Reuters.
Chas Freeman, a retired US diplomat who served as US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said he could think of no other example of the United States openly killing a senior foreign government official during peacetime. “This is unprecedented,” Freeman said.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, a top contender among Democrats seeking to run against Trump in the November presidential election, said Trump had “tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox.”
After being briefed by US officials in Washington, House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a Democrat, questioned why Trump chose to act against Soleimani now, when previous administrations decided such a step would increase the risks in the region.
“If the administration has a broader strategy, they have yet to articulate it,” Schiff told reporters.
As chief of the Quds Force, the Revolutionary Guards foreign arm, Soleimani had a main role in fighting in Syria and Iraq. Over two decades he was at the forefront of projecting Iran’s military influence across the Middle East and survived several assassination attempts by Western, Israeli and Arab agencies, acquiring celebrity status at home and abroad.
President Hassan Rouhani said the killing would stiffen Iran’s resistance to the United States.
In Tehran, the capital, hundreds of demonstrators marched toward Khamenei’s compound to convey their condolences.
“I am not a pro-regime person but I liked Soleimani. He was brave and he loved Iran, I am very sorry for our loss,” said housewife Mina Khosrozadeh in Tehran.
Soleimani became head of the Quds Force in 1998, after which he strengthened Iran’s ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria’s government and Shi’ite militia groups in Iraq.
In Soleimani‘s home town, Kerman, people wearing black gathered in front of his father’s house, weeping as they listened to a recitation from the Koran.
“Heroes never die. It cannot be true. Qassem Soleimani will always be alive,” said Mohammad Reza Seraj, a teacher.

403,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/australian-pm-calls-up-reservists-as-fire-threats-escalate/,"SYDNEY: Australia’s prime minister called up about 3,000 reservists as the threat of wildfires escalated Saturday in at least three states with two more deaths, and strong winds and high temperatures were forecast to bring flames to populated areas including the suburbs of Sydney.
Scott Morrison said 23 deaths have been confirmed so far this summer, including the two in a blaze on a highway on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia. “We are facing another extremely difficult next 24 hours,” he told a televised news conference.

“In recent times, particularly over the course of the balance of this week, we have seen this disaster escalate to an entirely new level,” Morrison said.
He also confirmed that his scheduled visits to India and Japan later this month have been postponed. He was due to visit India from Jan. 13-16 and Japan immediately afterwards. Morrison came under fire for taking a family vacation in Hawaii as the wildfire crisis unfolded in December.
“Just around half an hour ago the governor general signed off on the call-out of the Australian Defence Force Reserve to search and bring every possible capability to bear by deploying army brigades to fire-affected communities,” he said.
Defense Minister Linda Reynolds said this was the first time that reservists have been called out “in this way in living memory and, in fact, I believe for the first time in our nation’s history.”
The government has committed 20 million Australian dollars ($14 million) to lease four fire-fighting aircraft for the duration of the crisis, and the helicopter-equipped HMAS Adelaide was deployed to assist evacuations from fire-ravaged areas.
The fire danger increased as temperatures rose to record levels across Australia, surpassing 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit) in the capital Canberra and 48 C (118 F) in Penrith, in Sydney’s western suburbs.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said her state was facing “another terrible day” and called on people in areas threatened by the fires to leave while they can.
“I’m pleased to say that we’ve never been as prepared as we are today for the onslaught we’re likely to face,” Berejiklian told reporters. “All of the major road networks are still open but we can’t guarantee that beyond the next few hours. So there are still windows for people to get out.”
The deadly fire on Kangaroo Island broke containment lines Friday and was described as “virtually unstoppable” as it destroyed buildings and burned through more than 14,000 hectares (35,000 acres) of Flinders Chase National Park. While the warning level for the fire was reduced Saturday, the Country Fire Service said it was still a risk to lives and property.
New South Wales Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers warned the fires could move “frighteningly quick.” Embers carried by the wind had the potential to spark new fires or enlarge existing blazes.
Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fizsimmons said the 264,000-hectare (652,000-acre) Green Wattle Creek fire in a national park west of Sydney had the potential to spread into Sydney’s western suburbs.
He said crews have been doing “extraordinary work” by setting controlled fires and using aircraft and machinery to try to keep the flames away.
Fitzsimmons called on residents and tourists in the path of the fires to evacuate as soon as possible.
“Our message has been to make sure you leave yesterday,” he said. “Leaving it until today is cutting it fine. The sooner you make that decision the better and I would say do it now. Don’t leave it any longer because the window will shrink and will shrink very quickly.”
More than 130 fires were burning in New South Wales and at least half of those were out of control. Temperatures in parts of the state are expected to soar in the mid-40s C (about 113 F) amid strong winds and low humidity.
A total of 48 fires were burning across almost 320,000 hectares (791,000 acres) in Victoria state and conditions were expected to worsen with a southerly wind change.
“We still have those dynamic and dangerous conditions, the low humidity, the strong winds and, what underpins that, the state is tinder dry,” Victoria Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp said.
Thousands have already fled fire-threatened areas in Victoria and Crisp urged more people to leave.
“If you might be thinking about I can get out on a particular road close to you, well there’s every chance that a fire could hit that particular road and you can’t get out,” he said.
Victoria police reported heavy traffic flows on major roads and praised motorists for their patient and orderly behavior.
The early and devastating start to Australia’s summer wildfires has already burned about 5 million hectares (12.35 million acres) of land and destroyed more than 1,500 homes. That’s more acres burned in Australia than any one year in the U.S. since Harry Truman was president.

404,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/cycle-of-revenge-whats-next-after-killing-of-iran-general/,"JERUSALEM: The unprecedented killing of Iran’s top general in a US airstrike in Iraq has sent shockwaves across the Middle East, with Iran and its allies vowing revenge amid fears of an all-out war.
But while they have vast arsenals and are within striking distance of US troops deployed in Syria, Iraq and the Gulf, Iran may be wary of launching a retaliatory attack that could ignite a major conflict.

The targeted attack on Friday could give them pause by signaling that the mercurial President Donald Trump is willing to wield US military power in dramatic and unforeseen ways.
The slain general, Qassem Soleimani, was a towering figure who mobilized heavily-armed militias across the region against the United States and its allies, extending Iran’s influence to the Mediterranean.
His death was a major blow to Iran and led nearly everyone from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on down to vow massive retaliation.
“There will be for sure a reaction from Iran’s side and the axis of resistance, but the question is where, when and how,” said Ibrahim Bayram, an analyst with Lebanon’s daily An-Nahar. “I think the Iranians are precise and know how to direct the hit.”
Here is a look at possible scenarios going forward:
___
AMERICA OUT OF IRAQ
The most immediate repercussions are likely to be felt in Iraq, where the airstrike — which also killed a top Iraqi militia commander — was seen as an assault on the country’s sovereignty.
Iraq’s parliament will meet for an emergency session Sunday. On Saturday, the country’s powerful Iran-backed militias will hold a funeral in Baghdad that thousands are expected to attend.
The targeted killing is likely to strengthen Iran-backed forces and political factions in the face of anti-government protesters who oppose Tehran’s influence. Iran’s allies can now present themselves as upholding national sovereignty against foreign aggression.
Iraq’s government, which has maintained an uneasy alliance with both Washington and Tehran, will come under mounting pressure to expel the 5,200 American troops who are in the country to help prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group.
Restricting or expelling American troops on Iraqi soil is a likely immediate impact option, according to Renad Mansour, a research fellow at the London-based international affairs think tank Chatham House.
“I think it would be hard for any Iraqi government official making a claim to keep American troops after this,” Mansour said. If America goes, he added, other diplomatic missions might follow.
That would place Iraq even more firmly in Iran’s camp, alongside Syria and Lebanon, and fulfill a goal Soleimani had pursued since the 2003 US-led invasion.
But it might not be enough.
___
REGIONAL PRESSURE POINTS
Over the last decade, Soleimani had mobilized tens of thousands of heavily armed fighters in Syria and Iraq, who have battled alongside President Bashar Assad in Syria’s civil war and fought the Islamic State group in both countries.
The United States has relatively small deployments of troops in both countries who could be targeted in revenge attacks. The latest escalation began last week when a rocket attack blamed on an Iran-backed Iraqi militia killed a US contractor.
The US responded with a wave of airstrikes that killed 25 militiamen in Iraq and Syria, and the militiamen then staged two days of violent protests at the US Embassy in Baghdad. No one was hurt in the protests, but demonstrators breached the embassy compound.
Iran could also exact revenge through allies further afield, in Lebanon, Yemen or the Gaza Strip.
The Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group dominates Lebanon and has an arsenal of tens of thousands of rockets that can hit every part of Israel. But it is unlikely to risk an all-out war that would devastate Lebanon, which is already in the grip of a severe economic crisis and its own anti-government protests.
___
CYBERATTACKS AND OTHER POSSIBLE RETALIATION TACTICS
Security experts said cyberattacks were likely to be part of Iran’s retaliation. And while cautioning that the US power grid is quite resilient, there are plenty of other opportunities for major disruption, they said.
Other potential targets include the financial sector, manufacturing, oil and gas plants and transit systems.
Iranian hackers carried out a series of disruptive attacks that knocked US banks’ websites offline prior to the Obama administration’s 2015 nuclear deal.
“Our concern is essentially that things are going to go back to the way they were before the agreement,” said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm FireEye. “There are opportunities for them to cause us real disruption.”
Iran has also been doing a lot of probing of US industrial systems in recent years — trying to gain access — but has limited its destructive attacks to targets in the Middle East such as the Saudi oil company, experts say.
STRIKING THE GULF
Rather than unleashing its proxies, Iran might respond on its own by targeting U.S. allies in the Gulf and their oil infrastructure. The US blamed Iran for a sophisticated attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities in September that temporarily halved its oil production.
The US also blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers last year in the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world’s oil passes. Iran denied those allegations, but acknowledged shooting down a US surveillance drone in June.
Iran could also retaliate by abandoning the 2015 nuclear deal, which has gradually come unraveled since Trump withdrew from the agreement in May 2018 and restored crippling sanctions.
Iran has already openly breached some of its commitments in response to the sanctions and could announce a major new drive to enrich uranium.
___
SOUND AND FURY?
There’s also the possibility, amid all the dire predictions, that Iran does nothing, at least for now.
Israel, for one, does not appear terribly concerned. Authorities closed a ski resort near the borders with Lebanon and Syria, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a trip to Greece, but there have been no other security measures or any talk of calling up reserves.
“I think the Iranians are shocked now,” said Yoel Guzansky, an expert on Iran at the Institute for National Strategic Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank.
Iran and its allies have lost several other senior commanders over the years. While they always vow revenge, they usually add that it will happen at a time and place of their choosing — and the crisis passes.
For example, Hezbollah vowed revenge after one of its top commanders, Imad Mughniyeh, was killed in a bombing in Damascus that the group blamed on Israel. That was in 2008, and while the group has traded fire with Israel since then, it has not carried out any major attacks.
Then again, there’s no real precedent for the killing of a figure like Soleimani.
Joost Hiltermann, the Middle East program director at the Crisis Group, an international think tank, says “we could see a war.”
“They have put themselves in a corner. They will have to respond,” he said.

NEW DELHI: More than 1,000 members of India’s LGBTQ community, rights groups and their supporters marched through the streets of the capital on Friday to protest a citizenship law that excludes Muslims.
Describing themselves as “Citizens Against Bigots,” they carried placards and shouted slogans accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government of pursuing policies aimed at forcing people to prove their citizenship and putting people from marginalized communities at risk.
India’s main opposition parties, led by the Congress party, say the Modi government is trying to consolidate its Hindu base, which constitutes more than 80% of India’s 1.3 billion people. Muslims comprise nearly 14% of the population.
The new citizenship law and a proposed National Register of Citizens have brought thousands of protesters out in the streets in many cities and towns since Parliament approved the measure on Dec. 11, leaving at least 23 dead in clashes between security forces and the protesters.
The law allows Hindus, Christians, and other religious minorities who are in India illegally to become citizens if they can show they were persecuted because of their religion in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. It does not apply to Muslims.
Thousands of Hindus, too, have joined the protests to assure the minority Muslims that they are not isolated. The governing Hindu nationalist party downplays the protests, saying they are orchestrated by opponents.

408,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/how-climate-change-other-factors-stoke-australia-fires/,"Australia’s unprecedented wildfires are supercharged thanks to climate change, the type of trees catching fire and weather, experts say.
And these fires are so extreme that they are triggering their own thunderstorms.
Here are a few questions and answers about the science behind the Australian wildfires that so far have burned about 5 million hectares (12.35 million acres), killing at least 17 people and destroying more than 1,400 homes.


“They are basically just in a horrific convergence of events,” said Stanford University environmental studies director Chris Field, who chaired an international scientific report on climate change and extreme events. He said this is one of the worst, if not the worst, climate change extreme events he’s seen.
“There is something just intrinsically terrifying about these big wildfires. They go on for so long, the sense of hopelessness that they instill,” Field said. “The wildfires are kind of the iconic representation of climate change impacts.”
Q: Is climate change really a factor?
A: Scientists, both those who study fire and those who study climate, say there’s no doubt man-made global warming has been a big part, but not the only part, of the fires.
Last year in Australia was the hottest and driest on record, with the average annual temperature 2.7 degrees (1.5 degrees Celsius) above the 1960 to 1990, average, according to Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology. Temperatures in Australia last month hit 121.8 degrees (49.9 degrees Celsius).
“What would have been a bad fire season was made worse by the background drying/warming trend,” Andrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology, said in an email.
Mike Flannigan, a fire scientist at the University of Alberta in Canada, said Australia’s fires are “an example of climate change.”
A 2019 Australian government brief report on wildfires and climate change said, “Human-caused climate change has resulted in more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires in recent decades for many regions of Australia.”
Q: How does climate change make these fires worse?
A: The drier the fuel — trees and plants — the easier it is for fires to start and the hotter and nastier they get, Flannigan said.
“It means more fuel is available to burn, which means higher intensity fires, which makes it more difficult — or impossible — to put out,” Flannigan said.
The heat makes the fuel drier, so they combine for something called fire weather. And that determines “fuel moisture,” which is crucial for fire spread. The lower the moisture, the more likely Australian fires start and spread from lightning and human-caused ignition, a 2016 study found.
There’s been a 10% long-term drying trend in Australia’s southeast and 15% long-term drying trend in the country’s southwest, Watkins said. When added to a degree of warming and a generally southward shift of weather systems, that means a generally drier landscape.
Australia’s drought since late 2017 “has been at least the equal of our worst drought in 1902,” Australia’s Watkins said. “It has probably been driven by ocean temperature patterns in the Indian Ocean and the long term drying trend.”
Q: Has Australia’s fire season changed?
A: Yes. It’s about two to four months longer, starting earlier especially in the south and east, Watkins said.
“The fires over the last three months are unprecedented in their timing and severity, started earlier in spring and covered a wider area across many parts of Australia,” said David Karoly, leader of climate change hub at Australia’s National Environmental science Program. “The normal peak fire season is later in summer and we are yet to have that.”
Q: Is weather, not just long-term climate, a factor?
A: Yes. In September, Antarctica’s sudden stratospheric warming — sort of the southern equivalent of the polar vortex — changed weather conditions so that Australia’s normal weather systems are farther north than usual, Watkins said.
That means since mid-October there were persistent strong westerly winds bringing hot dry air from the interior to the coast, making the fire weather even riskier for the coasts.
“With such a dry environment, many fires were started by dry lightning events (storms that brought lightning but limited rainfall),” Watkins said.
Q: Are people starting these fires? Is it arson?
A: It’s too early to tell the precise cause of ignition because the fires are so recent and officials are spending time fighting them, Flannigan said.
While people are a big factor in causing fires in Australia, it’s usually accidental, from cars and trucks and power lines, Flannigan said. Usually discarded cigarettes don’t trigger big fires, but when conditions are so dry, they can, he said.
Q: Are these fires triggering thunderstorms?
A: Yes. It’s an explosive storm called pyrocumulonimbus and it can inject particles as high as 10 miles into the air.
During a fire, heat and moisture from the plants are released, even when the fuel is relatively dry. Warm air is less dense than cold air so it rises, releasing the moisture and forming a cloud that lifts and ends up a thunderstorm started by fire. It happens from time to time in Australia and other parts of the world, including Canada, Flannigan said.
“These can be deadly, dangerous, erratic and unpredictable,” he said.
Q: Are the Australian trees prone to burning?
A: Eucalyptus trees are especially flammable, “like gasoline on a tree,” Flannigan said. Chemicals in them make them catch fire easier, spread to the tops of trees and get more intense. Eucalyptus trees were a big factor in 2017 fires in Portugal that killed 66 people, he said.
Q: How can you fight these huge Australia fires?
A: You don’t. They’re just going to burn in many places until they hit the beach, Flannigan said.
“This level of intensity, direct attack is useless,” Flannigan said. “You just have to get out of the way… It really is spitting on a campfire. It’s not doing any good.”
Q: What’s the long-term fire future look like for Australia?
A: “The extreme fire season in Australia in 2019 was predicted,” said Australian National University climate scientist Nerilie Abram. “The question that we need to ask is how much worse are we willing to let this get? This is what global warming of just over 1 degree C looks like. Do we really want to see the impacts of 3 degrees or more are like, because that is the trajectory we are on.”

409,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/indonesia-capital-floods-leave-43-dead-397000-displaced/,"JAKARTA, INDONESIA: The death toll from floods in Indonesia’s capital rose to 43 of Friday as rescuers found more bodies amid receding floodwaters, disaster officials said.
Monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged at least 182 neighborhoods in greater Jakarta and caused landslides in the Bogor and Depok districts on the city’s outskirts, which buried a dozen people.


National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said the fatalities also included those who had drowned or been electrocuted since rivers broke their banks Wednesday after extreme torrential rains throughout New Year’s Eve. Three elderly people died of hypothermia.
It was the worst flooding since 2013, when 57 people were killed after Jakarta was inundated by monsoon rains.
Floodwaters started receded in some parts of the city on Thursday evening, enabling residents to return to their homes.
Wibowo said about 397,000 people sought refuge in shelters across the greater metropolitan area.
Those returning to their homes found streets covered in mud and debris. Cars that had been parked in driveways were swept away, landing upside down in parks or piled up in narrow alleys. Sidewalks were strewn with sandals, pots and pans and old photographs. Authorities took advantage of the receding waters to clear away mud and remove piles of wet garbage from the streets.
Electricity was restored to tens of thousands of residences and businesses.
Jakarta’s Halim Perdanakusuma domestic airport reopened Thursday after its runway was submerged. Nearly 20,000 passengers had been affected by the closure.
The flooding has highlighted Indonesia’s infrastructure problems.
Jakarta is home to 10 million people, or 30 million including those in its greater metropolitan area. It is prone to earthquakes and flooding and is rapidly sinking due to uncontrolled extraction of ground water. Congestion is also estimated to cost the economy $6.5 billion a year.
President Joko Widodo announced in August that the capital will move to a site in sparsely populated East Kalimantan province on Borneo island, known for rainforests and orangutans.

410,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/opposition-website-says-at-least-631-killed-in-iran-unrest/,"
DUBAI: An opposition website said on Thursday that at least 631 people had been killed in Iran during unrest that broke out in November.
The reported toll has varied between a Reuters account of 1,500 dead and an Amnesty International figure of more than 300. Both have been dismissed by Iranian authorities.
“According to the classified official bulletin, at least 631 people were killed during the unrest … most of them were lower-income people,” the Iranian reformist Kaleme website reported.
Hundreds of young and working-class Iranians took to the streets on Nov. 15 to protest against fuel price rises. The protests turned political, with demonstrators burning pictures of senior officials and calling on clerical rulers to step down.
London-based Amnesty said more than 300 people were killed and thousands were arrested following a crackdown after the unrest, for which Iranian officials have blamed foreign enemies.
Iranian authorities, who have yet to give a death toll, have dismissed Amnesty’s figures and a Reuters report that said 1,500 people were killed in less than two weeks after protests erupted.
Tehran said in December that some “rioters” were shot dead by security forces. Iran’s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, denounced the unrest as a “very dangerous conspiracy” by Iran’s enemies.

411,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/irans-gen-soleimani-killed-in-airstrike-at-baghdad-airport/,"BAGHDAD: An airstrike killed General Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran’s elite Quds Force and architect of its regional security apparatus, at Baghdad’s international airport Friday, Iranian state television and three Iraqi officials said, an attack that’s expected to draw severe Iranian retaliation against Israel and American interests.
The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF, the officials said. The PMF media arm said the two were killed in an American airstrike that targeted their vehicle on the road to the airport.

Citing a Revolutionary Guard statement, Iranian state television said Soleimani was “martyred” in an attack by US helicopters near the airport, without elaborating.
There was no immediate comment from US officials, and US President Donald Trump was vacationing on his estate in Palm Beach, Florida.
Their deaths are a potential turning point in the Middle East and if the US carried them out, it represents a drastic change for American policy toward Iran after months of tensions.
Tehran shot down a US military surveillance drone and seized oil tankers. Meanwhile, the US blames Iran for a series of attacks targeting tankers, as well as a September assault on Saudi Arabia’s oil industry that temporarily halved its production.
The tensions take root in Trump’s decision in May 2018 to withdraw the US from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, struck under his predecessor.
A senior Iraqi politician and a high-level security official confirmed to The Associated Press that Soleimani and al-Muhandis were among those killed in the attack shortly after midnight. Two militia leaders loyal to Iran also confirmed the deaths, including an official with the Kataeb Hezbollah faction, which was involved in the New Year’s Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the US Embassy in Baghdad.
The security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said al-Muhandis had arrived to the airport in a convoy along with others to receive Soleimani, whose plane had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria. The airstrike took place near the cargo area after he left the plane to be greeted by al-Muhandis and others.
Two officials from the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces said Suleimani’s body was torn to pieces in the attack while they did not find the body of al-Muhandis. A senior politician said Soleimani’s body was identified by the ring he wore.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject and because they were not authorised to give official statements.
As the head of the Quds, or Jersualem, Force of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Soleimani led all of its expeditionary forces. Quds Force members have deployed into Syria’s long war to support President Bashar Assad, as well as into Iraq in the wake of the 2003 US invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, a longtime foe of Tehran.
Soleimani rose to prominence by advising forces fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria on behalf of the embattled Assad.
US officials say the Guard under Soleimani taught Iraqi militants how to manufacture and use especially deadly roadside bombs against US troops after the invasion of Iraq. Iran has denied that. Soleimani himself remains popular among many Iranians, who see him as a selfless hero fighting Iran’s enemies abroad.
Soleimani had been rumoured dead several times, including in a 2006 aeroplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern Iran and following a 2012 bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of Assad. Rumours circulated in November 2015 that Soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syria’s Aleppo.
Earlier Friday, an official with the Popular Mobilisation Forces said seven people were killed by a missile fired at Baghdad International Airport, blaming the United States.
The official with the group known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces said the dead included its airport protocol officer, identifying him as Mohammed Reda.
A security official confirmed that seven people were killed in the attack on the airport, describing it as an airstrike. Earlier, Iraq’s Security Media Cell, which releases information regarding Iraqi security, said Katyusha rockets landed near the airport’s cargo hall, killing several people and setting two cars on fire.
It was not immediately clear who fired the missile or rockets or who was targeted. There was no immediate comment from the US
The attack came amid tensions with the United States after a New Year’s Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the US Embassy in Baghdad. The two-day embassy attack which ended Wednesday prompted President Donald Trump to order about 750 US soldiers deployed to the Middle East.
It also prompted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to postpone his trip to Ukraine and four other countries “to continue monitoring the ongoing situation in Iraq and ensure the safety and security of Americans in the Middle East,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Wednesday.
The breach at the embassy followed US airstrikes on Sunday that killed 25 fighters of the Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb Hezbollah. The US military said the strikes were in retaliation for last week’s killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that the US blamed on the militia.
US officials have suggested they were prepared to engage in further retaliatory attacks in Iraq.
“The game has changed,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Thursday, telling reporters that violent acts by Iran-backed Shiite militias in Iraq — including the rocket attack on Dec. 27 that killed one American — will be met with US military force.
He said the Iraqi government has fallen short of its obligation to defend its American partner in the attack on the US embassy.
The developments also represent a major downturn in Iraq-US relations that could further undermine US influence in the region and American troops in Iraq and weaken Washington’s hand in its pressure campaign against Iran.

BATEMAN’S BAY: The Australian navy on Friday began the evacuations of some of the thousands of people stranded on the east coast of the fire-ravaged country as a searing weather front was set to whip up more blazes across the states of Victoria and New South Wales (NSW).
At the peak of the summer holiday period, tens of thousands of holidaymakers were urged to leave national parks and tourist areas on the NSW south coast and eastern areas of Victoria before a return of temperatures above 40C (104 F) and strong winds on Saturday.

Traffic out of Bateman’s Bay, a popular holiday spot on the NSW south coast, was less busy than on Wednesday and Thursday, with many people having heeded the directives to leave the area before the weekend.
Victoria declared a state of disaster for the first time, giving authorities broad powers to compel people to leave their properties and take control of services, similar to the state of emergency that has been declared in NSW.
Andrew Crisp, emergency management commissioner for Victoria, urged people in at-risk areas to leave their homes immediately and not count on luck to avoid disaster.
“This is your opportunity to get out. It is not just the fires we know. It is the new fires that might start today,” he told ABC News.
Another death from the fires in NSW was confirmed on Friday, taking the toll in the state this week to eight. Two people have died in Victoria’s fires, and 28 others are unaccounted for.
The navy’s HMAS Choules and Sycamore started the evacuations of nearly 1,000 of the 4,000 people stranded on a beach in the isolated town of Malla­coota in far-east Victoria, federal member of parliament Darren Chester tweeted on Friday morning.
With all roads blocked, sea transport and some airlifts are the only way out of the stricken town, and each round trip by sea could take a day or more.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison had called for calm on Thursday, before visiting the fire-devastated NSW town of Cobargo where he was not entirely welcome.
Video showed Morrison confronted by a group of angry locals, one of whom shouted he should be “ashamed of himself” and said he had “left the country to burn”.
NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance, whose represents the local area and is from the same party as the Prime Minister, said he had not heard from Morrison and did not know he was visiting the area.
“To be honest the locals probably gave him the welcome he probably deserved,” he told Channel 7.
Morrison’s conservative government has long drgmaiawn criticism for not doing enough to address climate change as a cause of Australia’s savage drought and fires.
Bushfires so far this season have scorched more than 4 million hectares (10 million acres) of bushland and destroyed over 1,000 homes, including 381 homes destroyed on the south coast just this week.


Anthony Albanese, head of the opposition Labor Party, called for a national response to a national emergency. “We haven’t, in my lifetime, had people on beaches waiting to be evacuated in life jackets…like it’s a peacetime version of something that we have seen during wartime. This is not business as usual,” he said in a media conference.
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews says the state of disaster was an extraordinary step for extraordinary circumstances. “If you can leave you must leave. Not just for your safety but for the safety of those who may be called to your aid,” he told ABC news.
Ten people have been killed by wildfires in the eastern states of NSW and Victoria since Monday, and 28 are still missing in Victoria.
NSW rural fire service says there are 127 fires burning in the state and warned of a fire front stretching 60 to 70 km (37-44 miles) on Saturday. Past Saturday, there were no other peak days of fire danger forecast for a while.
Police and emergency services again urged tourists on the state’s South Coast and in the Snowy Mountains to leave the area ahead of dangerous fire conditions. The deadline to leave Kosciuszko National Park was 10 am Friday (2300 GMT Thursday).
Thousands of people had already been evacuated from the region of East Gippsland in Victoria, one of the largest in the country since the northern city of Darwin evacuated over 35,000 people in the aftermath of cyclone Tracy in 1974.
A contingent of 39 firefighters from North America landed in Melbourne this week, bringing to almost 100 the number of US and Canadian experts who have flown in to help deal with the crisis.
New Zealand’s government said it would send another 22 firefighters next week. Since October, NZ has deployed 157 firefighters to Australia.
Morrison, forced to defend his government’s limited action on climate change, blamed a three-year drought and lack of hazard reduction for the unprecedented extent and duration of this year’s bushfires.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed sympathy for those who have suffered in Australia, UN spokesman Farhan Haq said on Thursday, adding that Guterres has warned that when it comes to tackling global warming, “right now the pace we’re on, we’re not winning that race.”

413,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/hundreds-arrested-in-hong-kong-in-new-years-day-protests/,"
HONG KONG: Hong Kong police arrested about 400 people in New Year’s Day protests after what started as a peaceful pro-democracy march of tens of thousands spiralled into chaotic scenes with police firing tear gas to disperse the crowds.
The arrests take the total to about 7,000 since protests in the city escalated in June over a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, and will highlight the apparent absence of any progress towards ending the unrest.
The tension on Wednesday rose after some arrests were made in the Wan Chai bar district near a branch of global banking group HSBC, which has been the target of protester anger in recent weeks.
When scuffles broke out, large numbers of black-clad protesters rushed to the scene while other protesters formed human chains to pass them various supplies including bricks, forcing police to bring in their own reinforcements.
Police then asked organisers to call off the march early and crowds eventually dispersed as a water cannon truck and scores of police in riot gear patrolled the streets late into the evening.
Jimmy Sham, one of the leaders of the Civil Human Rights Front that organised the march, criticised the police decision to get the crowd to disperse at such short notice and said they had arrested protesters indiscriminately.
Police told media on Thursday they had arrested 420 people over the New Year holiday, most on New Year’s Day, with 287 of them in one sweep for illegal assembly, including a 12-year old.
Police said they only made the arrests on Wednesday after they notified the march organisers and gave sufficient time for demonstrators to leave. Four officers were injured during the day, they said.
Organisers estimated that just over one million people took part in the New Year’s Day march. Police put the number at 60,000 at its peak.
Over the months, the protests have evolved into a broad movement pushing for full democracy in the Chinese-ruled city and an independent investigation into complaints of police brutality. Police maintain they act with restraint.
Arrests were also made on New Year’s Eve, when protesters briefly occupied a major road on the Kowloon peninsula as crowds of thousands counted down to midnight along the Victoria harbour.
Some protesters allege HSBC was complicit in action by the authorities against activists trying to raise money to support their campaign. The bank denies any involvement.

414,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/family-man-stabbed-in-hanukkah-attack-may-have-brain-damage/,"NEW YORK: A man wounded in the Hanukkah stabbings north of New York City may have permanent brain damage and be partially paralyzed for the rest of his life, his family said.
The Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council released a statement from the family of Josef Neumann, 71, and a graphic photograph Wednesday showing severe head injuries he received Saturday at a rabbi’s home in Monsey, New York.

Four other people were injured in the attack, which federal prosecutors say was a hate crime.
The photograph shows an intubated Neumann with a swollen and disfigured face lying in a hospital bed. A gash to his head appears to have been stitched up.
Neumann’s family released the photograph for the world and “the Jewish community to understand the gravity of hate,” Yossi Gestetner, the council’s co-founder, said in an interview. Neumann has seven children.
“These things are vividly and viciously disturbing and have long-term consequences,” Gestetner said.
The 18-inch machete used in the attack penetrated Neumann’s skull, the statement said, adding that Neumann’s “right arm has been shattered.”
“Our father’s status is so dire that no surgery has yet been performed on the right arm,” the statement said. “Doctors are not optimistic about his chances to regain consciousness, and if our father does miraculously recover partially, doctors expect that he will have permanent damage to the brain, leaving him partially paralyzed and speech-impaired for the rest of his life.”
The statement also called on Jewish people around the world to share their own experiences with anti-Semitism on social media using the hashtag #MeJew.
“We shall not let this terrible hate-driven attack be forgotten,” the statement said, “and let us all work to eradicate all sorts of hate.”
Federal prosecutors have charged Grafton Thomas, 37, with five federal counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs by attempting to kill with a dangerous weapon. He also has pleaded not guilty to five state counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary.
Authorities have said Thomas had handwritten journals containing anti-Semitic references and had recently used his phone to look up information on Hitler and the location of synagogues.
Thomas’ family has said he was raised in a tolerant home and had a history of mental illness.
The Hanukkah attack came amid a string of violence that has alarmed Jews in the region.
Former New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind said he recently spoke with an Orthodox Jewish man in New York who told him he had taken off his yarmulke out of fear.
“Part of what we’re trying to get across to people is that these attacks are not just statistics,” said Hikind, founder of Americans Against Antisemitism. “These people have to live with this the rest of their life.”
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday he has directed the state police to increase patrols in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods around New York. Mayor and fellow Democrat Bill de Blasio announced a similar heightened police presence in the city last week.
“Everybody feels very upset and disturbed about what happened,” Cuomo said during a New Year’s Day visit to Brooklyn’s heavily Orthodox Williamsburg neighborhood, “and everybody stands in solidarity with you.”

A fire official said three people were rescued from the debris of the building in Peera Garhi area in western New Delhi. Thirty-five fire engines were at the site, and the rescue operation was continuing for some people feared trapped there.

An eyewitness told New Delhi Television news channel he heard an explosion around 5 am and the fire station reported the structure collapsed soon afterward.
The fire official spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to release the information.
There were no workers inside the building when the fire broke out around 4 a.m., the police said.
The fire officials received injuries during the rescue work, the police said. They have been hospitalized.
The blaze was extinguished, but a heavy smoke engulfed the rear portion of the building which collapsed. It contained inflammable material like acid and plastic used for making batteries, the police said.
Poor safety standards are a frequent cause of fires in India. Last month, a fire believed to be caused by an electrical short circuit engulfed a building in New Delhi, killing at least 43 people.

BANGKOK: With protests from Chile to Hong Kong last year over widening inequality, violence against women, and climate change, more policymakers and campaigners started to openly debate potential shifts away from an economic model that relies on growth.
New Zealand became the first nation to introduce a Wellbeing Budget that requires all new spending to go to five priority areas including mental health, child well-being, indigenous people and a low-carbon-emission economy.
The idea of going beyond gross domestic product (GDP) as the main measure of success is not new.
Bhutan coined the term “gross national happiness” in the 1970s, the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development has released an annual well-being index since 2011, while the United Nations’ annual happiness report started in 2012.
But can nations prosper by putting well-being ahead of GDP in 2020? The Thomson Reuters Foundation asked nine experts:
ABDUL ABIAD, DIRECTOR, MACROECONOMIC RESEARCH DIVISION – ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK:
“A focus on sustained economic growth has helped raise hundreds of millions of Asians out of poverty over the last few decades. Continued GDP growth will be critical to pulling up the remaining 326 million who still struggle in extreme poverty.
But developing Asia is now largely middle-income, and people and policymakers are looking beyond progress only in income. An increasing focus on environmental sustainability, liveable cities, holistic health, and fairness and opportunities for all will be a hallmark of economic development in the coming years.
It is not an either-or proposition; these are growth sectors that have the potential to drive the region’s GDP.”
GEMMA CORRIGAN, LEAD, SUSTAINABLE MARKETS – WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM:
“In order to create a more equitable and sustainable world, we need to factor into our decision-making the consequences of our actions not only for financial and physical capital but for human, social and natural capital. This means measuring the impact of growth on living standards as well as future generations and the environment.
We can already do this; the next generation of measurements will also be able to take into account concepts like well-being so that we ensure our economic system is truly aligned with societal goals.”
KATHERINE TREBECK, POLICY & KNOWLEDGE LEAD, WELLBEING ECONOMY ALLIANCE:
“The question of our time is not whether nations can prosper putting well-being ahead of GDP, but how they can possibly continue to put GDP ahead of well-being and expect to prosper.
How can they stick to an outdated recipe in the face of evidence that GDP-orientated notions of prosperity are not only harming people and planet, but that the benefits of GDP in terms of social progress tail off after the work of growth is done? How can they refuse to embrace a new agenda, when there are thousands of examples of businesses, cities, communities and politicians who are striving towards a goal not of faster GDP or short-term profit, but returns for people and planet?”
KATRIN JAKOBSDOTTIR, PRIME MINISTER OF ICELAND:
“The climate crisis underlines the urgent need of thinking beyond GDP while measuring economic success. Prosperity without sustainability is no prosperity. The wellbeing economy initiative demands new thinking, putting people and the planet first. We have no choice but to rethink our economies to tackle the largest crises of our times: climate change and inequality.”
MATT MAYER, DIRECTOR, ECONOMY FOR THE COMMON GOOD:
“The current economic system, which measures success solely in financial terms, is no longer fit for purpose. The focus on GDP justifies the maximisation of profit above any competing interest, thereby exacerbating the very issues we so urgently need to address, like social inequality, global warming and environmental degradation.
Only by putting well-being, the health and happiness of people within the boundaries of a sustainable ecosystem ahead of GDP, can we hope to maintain the foundations of prosperity in the long run.
We need to measure what matters. That way we can make what matters the very criteria by which to tax business-as-usual and by which to incentivise the kind of businesses we want to see.”
MUHAMMAD YUNUS, NOBEL PRIZE LAUREATE & MICROFINANCE PIONEER:
“Economic growth is a means, it is not an end. The end is the world or society we want to build. If we want to build a world of, say, three zeros — zero poverty, zero unemployment, and net-zero carbon emissions – we have to craft the framework of economics and measurements to assess its successes and failures in achieving these goals. GDP and the economic framework which leads to it are not designed to achieving these goals.”
NICOLA STURGEON, FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLAND:
“Traditional measures like GDP are limited in what they can tell us about the distribution of income and wealth across society and whether it is sustainable for future generations.
As a government we recognise that economic growth is hugely important, but it must be matched by improvements in our environment, in people’s quality of life, in the opportunities available to people and the public services they have access to.
Wellbeing economy aims to deliver growth in a way that enhances the quality of life for all of our citizens and which is compatible with a net-zero emissions economy.
When we focus on wellbeing we start a conversation that provokes profound and fundamental questions on what really matters to us in our lives – what kind of country and society we want to live in.”
PINELOPI KOUJIANOU GOLDBERG, CHIEF ECONOMIST, WORLD BANK:
“Higher GDP is not the goal, well-being is!
Research suggests that people in wealthier countries are on average happier than those in poorer ones. Yet it is becoming clear that these citizens care about more than average growth. They value clean air and water, time with family, quality of work and life, and a more equitable distribution of income and wealth.
Often in low-income countries, the pursuit of traditional prosperity through economic growth is still the priority. But focusing on short-run growth, even in developing countries, may compromise long-run prosperity and well-being, as people suffer the consequences of environmental degradation and climate change.”
PEDRO CONCEICAO, DIRECTOR, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT OFFICE, UN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME:
“GDP was never designed to measure wellbeing. It is simply a metric of how much income is generated in an economy in any given year. Of course, income is important – it provides many of life’s essentials, propels investment, pays for social services and public goods. But there is more to life. Is a nation truly “prospering” if it is wrecking the environment or its citizens are not able to live dignified lives?
Pursuing genuine wellbeing, including but also going beyond income, recognises this. The Human Development Index http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-1-human-development-index-and-its-components-1 (HDI) – updated in December – adds health and education achievements to portray a broader measure of a nation’s prosperity.”

Five people survived the crash in mountains outside the capital.
As chief of the general staff, General Shen Yi-ming was responsible for overseeing the island’s defense against China, which threatens to use military force to annex what it considers it own territory.

The helicopter was flying from Taipei to the northeastern city of Ilan for a new year’s activity when it crashed.
According to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defence, 13 people were on the UH-60M Blackhawk helicopter, which took off shortly after 7:50 a.m. from Taipei’s Songshan air force base on its way to a base in Yilan county on the east coast. Just over 10 minutes later, it dropped from the radar screen and went down in the mountainous, heavily forested Wulai area southeast of the capital.
Shen, 63, had taken over as chief of the general staff in July after serving as commander of Taiwan’s air force, which is undergoing a substantial upgrade with the arrival of the most advanced version of the US F-16V fighter.
Alexander Huang, a strategic studies professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan who had known Shen for a decade, said he had stood out as a pilot and an officer.
“He was very calm and very stable and unlike other army guys he was always smiling, so he got a specific leadership style that also made him a popular leader in the entire military,” Huang said.
It will likely be months before the cause of the crash is known, but the pilots, both of whom were killed, appeared to have been highly experienced.
“Of course, reasonable people would think in the direction of mechanical failure or maintenance problem, but without proof you can’t say anything,” Huang said.
Taiwan’s military has operated Blackhawks for decades and in 2010, completed a sale for another 60 UH-Ms from the US for $3.1 billion.

The fight broke out Tuesday afternoon at the Regional Center for Social Reintegration in the town of Cieneguillas, located on the western flank of state capital Zacatecas, the state government said.

Local media reported that the dispute was triggered by a soccer game.
In a press conference Wednesday evening, state Public Security Minister Ismael Camberos said all prison staff working during the fight and on the previous shift would be investigated.
Camberos did not comment on the cause of the clash, but said the situation in the prison was under control.
After the fight, one inmate was arrested with a firearm, and three more guns were found in the prison, as well as various knives. Further searches will be conducted at the prison to rule out the presence of additional weapons, Camberos said.
In an interview with Mexican radio program Aristegui earlier on Wednesday, Camberos said officials believe the guns may have been brought in during visiting hours on New Year’s eve, as a search of the prison over the weekend found no such weapons.
“We are waiting for the results of the investigation – this includes the director, senior managers and commanders – to determine if we are going to remove staff,” he said.
The prison holds members of five criminal groups, including the Gulf Cartel, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel, Camberos said. 120 inmates were relocated after the fight in an attempt to prevent further violence, he added.
The government has launched an investigation to determine those responsible for the incident and how the weapons entered the prison.
The five wounded inmates are in stable condition, Camberos said in the interview.
Camberos noted that the Cieneguillas prison was built some three decades ago, when Mexico faced a different security landscape.
“We are investing and we are trying to modernize this prison,” he said.
The incident marks the latest blow to the security track record of Lopez Obrador, who took power in December 2018 pledging to reduce record levels of violence. Instead, Mexico was in 2019 on track to surpass the previous year’s total number of homicides, according to latest data.
Mexican prisons have long been plagued by violence. In 2017, at least 28 inmates were killed when a brutal fight broke out in a prison in the resort town of Acapulco.
Though he did not mention the prison fight specifically, Mexican Security Minister Alfonso Durazo cited the need to improve the nation’s penal system in a series of tweets detailing his security plans on Wednesday.
“We will continue promoting the reorganization of the prisons to fight the crime that is organized from there,” he wrote.

JAKARTA: The death toll from flash floods and landslides in and around Indonesia’s capital Jakarta reached at least 21 on Thursday, with more heavy rain forecast, authorities said.
The deadliest floods in years displaced more than 30,000 people and caused chaos across parts of Southeast Asia’s biggest city with train lines blocked and power outages in some areas.
Social affairs ministry spokesman Joko Hariyanto said in a message to Reuters that the death toll had now reached 21.

Swathes of Jakarta and nearby towns were inundated after heavy rain fell on Dec. 31 and into the early hours of New Year’s Day.
Indonesia’s geophysics agency forecast rain accompanied by lightning and strong winds later on Thursday.
Authorities did not give a full breakdown of the causes of death for all of the victims, but earlier said four people had drowned, four died in landslides and four more were electrocuted, while three died of hypothermia.
Jakarta and its surroundings are home to more than 30 million people. More than 50 people died in one of the capital’s deadliest floods in 2007 and five years ago much of the centre of the city was inundated after canals overflowed.
City authorities have in the last few years sought to improve low-lying Jakarta’s vulnerability to flooding during the rainy season.

The baby had lost too much blood to cry, but on Tuesday, hooked up to oxygen tubes and IV and swathed in bandages – he flexed his uninjured hand, sending a waterfall of tears coursing down the cheeks of his father, Somali farmer Abdi Abukar Hassan.
“Oh thank God,” Hassan exclaimed as his son moved for the first time after his right arm was shredded and his back torn by shrapnel in the bombing, which killed at least 90 people and wounded dozens at a bustling checkpoint. “Look, he is alive now, please let’s recite the Koran over him!”
Somalia’s al-Qaeda-linked Islamist al Shabaab insurgency claimed the bombing, saying it was directed at Turkish engineers and their government-provided security detail. In a rare admission, the group acknowledged civilian casualties but said they had been “unintentional”.
Al Shabaab wants to overthrow the weak, UN-backed government and impose a strict version of Islamic law. The conflict is complicated by layers of clan loyalties and rivalries between regional powers like Qatar and Turkey, which are jostling for power in the Horn of Africa nation.
On Wednesday, Hassan thanked the Turkish-run Erdogan Hospital for its free treatment, saying nurses had told him the oxygen and intravenous tubes would be removed from his baby and he may open his eyes later in the day.
Two Turkish nationals were killed in the explosion, which took place as Turkish engineers visited a construction site near the checkpoint.
Mohamed’s grandmother had left her tin shack to help the baby and his mother onto a minibus when the bomb went off. Mohamed’s mother was killed instantly.
His grandmother, wounded in the legs, staggered towards the family’s home, clutching him and screaming for help before she collapsed.
A neighbour ran out, shoeless, and tried, unsuccessfully, to flag down motorbike taxis fleeing the scene before catching a minibus to the hospital, cradling the baby’s bleeding arm attached by only a thin piece of skin. Hassan’s aunt called him to break the news.
“My wife, Naimo Mohamud Jeylani, she was very kind. May God rest her soul and take her to paradise,” said Hassan, as his six-year-old daughter Khadija and four-year-old Sadaq leaned silently against their father. “Thank God, my son is now moving. I am happy he is alive. Yesterday, I thought he was dead.’”

421,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/with-births-down-us-had-slowest-growth-rate-in-a-century/,"ORLANDO: The past year’s population growth rate in the United States was the slowest in a century due to declining births, increasing deaths and the slowdown of international migration, according to figures released Monday by the US Census Bureau.
The US grew from 2018 to 2019 by almost a half percent, or about 1.5 million people, with the population standing at 328 million this year, according to population estimates.
That’s the slowest growth rate in the US since 1917 to 1918, when the nation was involved in World War I, said William Frey, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution.
For the first time in decades, natural increase — the number of births minus the number of deaths — was less than 1 million in the US due to an aging population of Baby Boomers, whose oldest members entered their 70s within the past several years. As the large Boomer population continues to age, this trend is going to continue.
“Some of these things are locked into place. With the aging of the population, as the Baby Boomers move into their 70s and 80s, there are going to be higher numbers of deaths,” Frey said. “That means proportionately fewer women of child bearing age, so even if they have children, it’s still going to be less.”
Four states had a natural decrease, where deaths outnumbered births: West Virginia, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont.
For the first time this decade, Puerto Rico had a population increase. The island, battered by economic stagnation and Hurricane Maria in the past several years, increased by 340 people between 2018 and 2019, with people moving to the island offsetting natural decrease.

International migration to the US decreased to 595,000 people from 2018 to 2019, dropping from as many as 1 million international migrants in 2016, according to the population estimates. Immigration restrictions by the Trump administration combined with a perception that the US has fewer economic opportunities than it did before the recession a decade ago contributed to the decline, Frey said.
“Immigration is a wildcard in that it is something we can do something about,” Frey said. “Immigrants tend to be younger and have children, and they can make a population younger.”
Ten states had population declines in the past year. They included New York, which lost almost 77,000 people; Illinois, which lost almost 51,000 residents; West Virginia, which lost more than 12,000 people; Louisiana, which lost almost 11,000 residents; and Connecticut, which lost 6,200 people. Mississippi, Hawaii, New Jersey, Alaska and Vermont each lost less than 5,000 residents.
Regionally, the South saw the greatest population growth from 2018 to 2019, increasing 0.8% due to natural increase and people moving from others parts of the country. The Northeast had a population decrease for the first time this decade, declining 0.1% due primarily to people moving away.
Monday’s population estimates also offer a preview of which states may gain or lose congressional seats from next year’s apportionment process using figures from the 2020 Census. The process divvies up the 435 US House seats among the 50 states based on population.
Several forecasts predict California, the nation’s most populous state with 39.5 million residents, losing a seat for the first time. Texas, the nation’s second most-populous state with 28.9 million residents, is expected to gain as many as three seats, the most of any state.
According to Frey’s projections on Monday, Florida stands to gain two seats, while Arizona, Colorado, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon each stand to gain a seat. Besides, California, other states that will likely lose a seat are Alabama, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia.

422,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/big-crowd-gathers-in-hong-kong-for-1st-protest-rally-of-2020/,"
HONG KONG: A huge crowd gathered in Hong Kong Wednesday for an annual New Year’s Day protest march as the monthslong pro-democracy movement extends into 2020.
The massive rally followed overnight clashes between police and protesters on New Year’s Eve in a densely populated shopping district. Police also used tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons to break up groups of demonstrators who blocked traffic and lit fires in the street in the working class district of Mong Kok.
Hong Kong toned down its New Year’s celebrations amid the protests that began in June and which have dealt severe blows to the city’s retail, tourism and nightlife sectors.
Eric Lai, the vice convener of the march organizer, the Civil Human Rights Front, said he hoped to avoid a recurrence of the previous night’s violence.
“I really hope that this will be a peaceful protest,” Lai said. “We hope that the police can facilitate us, rather than provoking us, and to fire tear gas and water cannon at us.”
Such marches have often devolved at their conclusion into violence between hardcore, black-clad protesters and police. Both sides have been accused of provoking clashes, and nearly 6,500 protesters as young as 12 have been arrested in scores of incidents on streets, in shopping malls and on college campuses.
Recent protests have drawn participants from across Hong Kong society, sometimes numbering more than 1 million and packing the downtown area from Victoria Park to the government office complex a short distance away. Many joining in are concerned about an erosion of the former British colony’s civil liberties it was promised after being handed over to Chinese rule in 1997, along with a shortage of well-paying jobs and a yawning divide between the city’s ruling class and those merely getting by amid soaring housing costs.
This year’s event appeared to be significantly larger than in past years, although estimates of the numbers of participants often vary widely between organizers and police. Riot police were positioned in side streets along the march route, but there were no immediate reports of clashes.
Tuesday night’s police actions were focused on the more industrial and working class districts on the city’s Kowloon side where protesters were watching a New Year’s light show.
The protests began in June over proposed legislation that could have allowed residents to be extradited to China where they could face possible torture and unfair trials. The legislation was withdrawn, but not before the protests expanded to wider calls for reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.
Protesters Tuesday also gathered at the Prince Edward subway station where police four months ago had rushed in, beating and tear gassing demonstrators who had no way to flee. That incident is among many cited by demonstrators as cases of police abuse for which no one has been held accountable.
In her New Year’s address, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the months of protests had brought “sadness, anxiety, disappointment and even rage,” and she vowed to tackle underlying social and economic problems in the coming year.
Lam said she would “listen humbly” to help bring an end to the protests but also reinforced the importance of the “one country, two systems” framework under which China rules Hong Kong and which brooks no challenge to the ruling Communist Party’s ultimate authority.
In his own New Year’s address, Chinese President Xi Jinping referred to the protests, saying “Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability is the wish of Hong Kong compatriots and the expectation for the people of the motherland.”

Pope Francis was walking through the square in Vatican City and greeting pilgrims on his way to see the large Nativity scene set up in the huge, cobbled esplanade.
After reaching out to touch a child, the pope turned away from the crowd only for a nearby woman to seize his hand and pull her towards him. The abrupt gesture appeared to cause him pain and Francis swiftly wrenched his hand free.
The woman had made the sign of the cross as the pope had approached. It was not clear what she was saying as she subsequently tugged him towards her.

Revellers around the globe are bidding farewell to a decade that will be remembered for the rise of social media, the Arab Spring, the #MeToo movement and, of course, President Donald Trump. A look at how the world is ushering in 2020:

___
NEW YORK
Fireworks burst and confetti fell as throngs of revellers cheered the start of 2020 in New York City’s Times Square.
In one of the globe’s most-watched New Year’s Eve spectacles, the crowd counted down the last seconds of 2019 as a luminescent crystal ball descended down a pole.
About 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms) of confetti showered the sea of attendees, many of whom were also briefly rained on earlier in the evening as they waited in security pens for performances by stars including rap-pop star Post Malone, K-pop group BTS, country singer Sam Hunt and singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette.
The crowds packed into the heart of Manhattan mouthed lyrics and waved yellow and purple balloons in a frenzy as midnight approached.
“It was a dream, I wanted to do it so this year a lot of people helped me to get here so I’m here, and I’m thankful for that,” said Mariemma Mejias, 48, who flew to New York for the festivities from San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The fun was evident, but some important global issues were driven home as well.
Spotlighting efforts to combat climate change, high school science teachers and students pressed the button that begins the famous 60-second ball drop and countdown to the new year.
___
RIO DE JANEIRO
About 3 million people welcomed 2020 at Brazil’s iconic Copacabana beach as almost 34,000 pounds (15,420 kilograms) of colourful fireworks went off for 14 minutes after midnight.
Rio de Janeiro holds one of the biggest New Year parties in the world, with music, drinks and religious rituals on the shores. Many dress in white in a traditional sign of their hope for peace. About 2,000 policemen are working to ensure party-goers are safe. Authorities say only minor incidents have been reported so far.
Many locals and tourists are expected to stick around Copacabana until Wednesday’s sunrise for their first dip of the year in the ocean, expecting to wash away their troubles from 2019. Summer in Rio often brings high temperatures early on.
The party in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s metropolis, took about 2 million people to Paulista Avenue, the city’s main road. Nearly all the 6,000 pounds (2,720 kilograms) of fireworks used there were silent so pets did not get too bothered by the noise.
___
PARIS
A joyful crowd of Parisians and tourists walked, biked and used scooters to reach the Champs-Elysees for the new year celebrations, in a city with almost no public transport amid massive strikes.
Revellers converged at the famous avenue to watch a light show at the Arc de Triomphe, followed by a fireworks display at midnight. Paris police set up a security perimeter around the Champs-Elysees area with a ban on alcohol and traffic restrictions.
All metro lines in the French capital were closed except for two automatic lines, and only a few night buses were running, as Tuesday marked the 27th consecutive day of transport strikes against President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to overhaul the French pension system.
___
ROME
Pope Francis delighted tourists and Romans in St. Peter’s Square on Tuesday night when he took a stroll to admire the Nativity scene. Shouts of “Pope! Pope!” and “Happy New Year!” resounded as families rushed to catch a glimpse of him or thrust out their infant in hopes he would pat their heads or pinch their cheeks.
One woman grabbed the pope’s hand and pulled him toward her to shake it. Francis, 83, exclaimed and then struck the woman’s hand twice to free his hand.
At a New Year’s Eve Vespers service in St. Peter’s Basilica, Francis urged people to practice more solidarity and to “build bridges, not walls.” Since becoming pontiff in 2013, Francis has preached openness — a reform-minded agenda that has irritated a small but vocal group of ultra-conservatives in the church.
___
HONG KONG
Revellers as well as pro-democracy protesters flocked to sites across Hong Kong to usher in 2020.
The semi-autonomous Chinese city has toned down New Year’s celebrations amid the monthslong demonstrations. The protests have repeatedly sparked pitched battles with police and have taken their toll on Hong Kong’s nightlife and travel industries.
A fireworks display that traditionally lights up famed Victoria Harbor was cancelled amid safety concerns, while some roads were closed and barriers set up in the Lan Kwai Fong nightlife district to control crowds.
___
RUSSIA
Russians began the world’s longest continuous New Year’s Eve with fireworks and a message from President Vladimir Putin urging them to work together in the coming year.
Putin made the call in a short speech broadcast on television just before the stroke of midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. The recorded message was followed by an image of the Kremlin Clock and the sound of its chimes. State TV showed footage of extensive festive fireworks in cities of the Far East.
But one holiday tradition was missing in Moscow this year — a picturesque layer of snow. The Russian capital has had an unusually warm December and temperatures in central Moscow as midnight approached were just above freezing.
___
AUSTRALIA
More than a million people descended on a hazy Sydney Harbour and surrounding areas to ring in the new year despite the ongoing wildfire crisis ravaging New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state.
The 9 p.m. fireworks over Sydney’s iconic landmarks was briefly delayed due to strong winds, but revellers clearly enjoyed themselves in a desperately needed tonic for the state.
New South Wales has born the brunt of the wildfire damage, which has razed more than 1,000 homes nationwide and killed 12 people in the past few months.
___
NEW ZEALAND
New Zealand’s major cities greeted the new year with fireworks as the nation appeared happy to be done with a year of challenges, both natural and man-made.
On March 15, a lone gunman identified killed 51 people and wounded dozens at two mosques in the South Island city of Christchurch. In December, an eruption of volcanic White Island off the east coast of the North Island killed at least 19 tourists and tour guides.
___
SAMOA
Fireworks erupted at midnight from Mount Vaea, overlooking the capital, Apia. The end of the year celebration was a time of sadness and remembrance.
A measles epidemic in late 2019 claimed 81 lives, mostly children under 5.
More than 5,600 measles cases were recorded in the nation of just under 200,000. With the epidemic now contained, the Samoa Observer newspaper named as its Person of the Year health workers who fought the outbreak.
___
LONDON
Londoners watched a spectacular fireworks display from the banks of the River Thames that was launched from the London Eye and barges near Parliament.
The familiar chimes of London’s Big Ben clock tower rung in the new year, even though they have been silent for most of 2019 because of extensive restoration work.
To the north, the multi-day Hogmanay New Year’s celebrations in Edinburgh began Monday night with a torchlight parade through the streets of the Scottish capital.
Security was tight in both cities and elsewhere in Britain following a recent extremist attack on London Bridge that claimed two lives. Police arrested five men on suspicion of terrorism offences Monday but said the arrests were not related to the London Bridge attack or to celebrations.
___
SOUTH AFRICA
Thousands of revellers gathered at Cape Town’s Waterfront area to ring in the new year with music, dancing and fireworks in front of the city’s iconic Table Mountain.
In past years, residents of Johannesburg’s poor Hillbrow neighbourhood would celebrate the New Year by tossing furniture, appliances and even refrigerators from the balconies of high-rise apartment buildings. Police have issued stern warnings, and it appears the dangerous tradition has declined.
In a sombre statement, President Cyril Ramaphosa said, “while our economy created jobs, these have not been nearly enough to stop the rise in unemployment or the deepening of poverty.”
South African singer Yvonne Chaka Chaka was deported from Uganda, where she was to perform at a New Year’s Eve event. Ugandan police cited visa issues, but Ugandan media reported it was because she had voiced support for Ugandan pop star Bobi Wine, the most potent opposition challenger to President Yoweri Museveni.
___
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
For nearly 10 minutes, fireworks lit the sky over Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, as hundreds of thousands gathered downtown to watch the spectacular display.
The New Year’s Eve display at the 828-meter-tall (2,716-foot-tall) skyscraper was just one of seven different fireworks shows across the emirate. Tourists, especially from Europe and Russia, flocked to the sunny beaches of Dubai at this time of year to escape the cold, dark winter.
To keep the massive crowds safe, police created walkways around the Burj Khalifa tower for male-only groups to separate them from families and women.
Dubai this year will be hosting Expo 2020, a world fair that brings the most cutting-edge and futuristic technologies.
___
JAPAN
People flocked to temples and shrines in Japan, offering incense with their prayers to celebrate the passing of a year and the first New Year’s of the Reiwa era.
Under Japan’s old-style calendar, linked to emperors’ rules, Reiwa started in May, after Emperor Akihito stepped down and his son Naruhito became emperor. Although Reiwa is entering its second year with 2020, Jan. 1 still marks Reiwa’s first New Year’s, the most important holiday in Japan.
Stalls at Zojoji Temple in Tokyo sold sweet rice wine, fried noodles and candied apples, as well as little amulets in the shape of mice, the zodiac animal for 2020. Since the Year of the Mouse starts off the Asian zodiac, it’s associated with starting anew.
Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, an event that is creating much anticipation for the entire nation.
___
INDONESIA
Tens of thousands of revellers in Indonesia’s capital of Jakarta were soaked by torrential rains as they waited for New Year’s Eve fireworks while others in the country were wary of an active volcano.
Festive events along coastal areas near the Sunda Strait were dampened by a possible larger eruption of Anak Krakatau, an island volcano that erupted last year just ahead of Christmas Day, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 430 people.
The country’s volcanology agency has warned locals and tourists to stay 2 kilometres (1.3 miles) from the volcano’s crater following an eruption Tuesday that blasted ash and debris up to 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) into the air.
___
SOUTH KOREA
Thousands of South Koreans filled cold downtown streets in Seoul ahead of a traditional bell-tolling ceremony near City Hall to send off an exhausting 2019 highlighted by political scandals, decaying job markets and crumbling diplomacy with North Korea.
Dignitaries ringing the old Bosingak bell at midnight included South Korean Major League Baseball pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu and Pengsoo, a giant penguin character with a gruff voice and blunt personality that emerged as one of the country’s biggest TV stars in 2019.
___
GERMANY
Hundreds of thousands of revellers were expected to ring in the New Year in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.
Several German cities including Munich and Hamburg have banned private fireworks amid concerns about the danger and environmental impacts from the increasingly powerful fireworks. A recent poll by the Forsa research institute found 59% of Germans would support a ban on private fireworks in city centres, while 37% were opposed.
___
LAS VEGAS
Tourism officials expected more than 300,000 revellers for fireworks fired at midnight from atop seven casinos on the resort-lined Las Vegas Strip. Thousands more were expected for live music and an LED light and sound show at the downtown Fremont Street Experience pedestrian mall.
“I tell people to expect one of the better fireworks they’re ever going to see,” said Michael Austin, a country music singer from Nashville, Tennessee, who was booked to perform in Las Vegas. “Swarms of people getting along, bringing in the new year.”
Juan and Isabel Tinajero, making their first family visit to Las Vegas, said they hoped 2020 brings less stress than 2019.
“I expect a great show,” Juan Tinajero said as Isabel pushed a stroller along the Las Vegas Strip sidewalk. “It’s Vegas, right?”
___
HONOLULU
Revellers packed beaches from Waikiki to the Big Island as Hawaii residents and visitors prepared to ring in the new decade.
A strong winter swell brought heavy waves to north-and west-facing shores of the islands Monday, nearly triggering the iconic Waimea Bay big wave contest named after Hawaiian surfing legend Eddie Aikau.
The waves weren’t quite big enough for the green light on the North Shore Oahu surfing competition, but waters across the archipelago saw above-average sets of rollers that some surfers took full advantage of.
On Oahu, people packed the streets of Waikiki, where a fireworks display would welcome 2020. But across the island at Ko Olina and Turtle Bay resorts, people gathered to the sounds of bumping music as tiki torches burned along walkways.
Comedian Bill Maher was spotted leaving one hotel as he prepared for his annual comedy show in Honolulu.
Fireworks displays both big and small were expected across the islands as the sanctioned shows competed with the less legal versions of the explosive festivities in neighbourhoods on every island.
At Ko Olina Resort on Oahu’s west side, people watched sun dip below the horizon of the Pacific as the sky turned shades of orange and red before a deep blue sky took over. A traditional Hawaii luau was set for later in the evening, with fire and hula dancers set to entertain the crowds.

425,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/britains-zero-carbon-power-outstrips-fossil-fuels-in-2019/,"
LONDON: Britain, the birthplace of coal power, produced more electricity from zero-carbon sources such as wind, solar and nuclear than from fossil fuel plants for the first time in 2019, National Grid said on Wednesday.
Having built the world’s first coal-fired power plant in the 1880s, coal became Britain’s dominant electricity source and a major economic driver for the next century. But last year Britain became the first G7 country to commit to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and in November will host the United Nations’ international climate talks in Glasgow.
“As we enter a new decade, this truly is a historic moment,” said National Grid Chief Executive John Pettigrew, referring to the company’s latest data.
The data shows wind, solar, hydro, nuclear and imports produced about 48.5% of Britain’s electricity in 2019 while fossil fuels such as coal and gas contributed about 43%. The rest came from biomass.
The increase in zero-carbon power marks a huge shift from almost two decades ago when fossil fuels provided about three quarters of the country’s electricity.
The shift has been mainly thanks to a rapid increase in Britain’s renewable power capacity, with wind, solar and hydro producing more than a quarter of the country’s electricity in 2019, up from only 2.3% in 1990.
This figure is expected to continue to grow as more large offshore wind farms are built.
The National Grid data shows that 8% of Britain’s electricity came from imports from Europe via interconnectors with France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland.
About 66% of these imports came from zero-carbon generation.
The data confirmed expectations for growth in low-carbon power published by National Grid in mid-2019, based on data for the first five months of the year.
Britain’s windy coastlines in particular have proved to be an ideal host for large wind projects, with the northwest coast of England home to the world’s largest offshore wind farm, Orsted’s Walney Extension.
