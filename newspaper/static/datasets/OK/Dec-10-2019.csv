Kathmandu, December 8
Following a recent Supreme Court verdict, the government has fixed a new capital gains tax amount for the private telecommunication company Ncell for the company’s 2016 buyout deal.
According to the new decision, the company now has to pay Rs 22 billion and 445 million. The Large Taxpayer Office has already served a 15-day notice to the company.
Earlier, in April-May, the office had fixed Rs 60 billion and Rs 712 million as the total CGT amount and said the company was yet to pay Rs 39 billion and 606 million. Unconvinced with the decision, the company had filed a case against the decision at the apex court.
As per the court verdict, the company was needed to pay Rs 21 billion and 104 million. The office says it has also sought Rs 22 billion and 445 million including the applicable interest. The court had said the government could collect an interest also.",/business,"Sun, 08 Dec 2019 10:03:30 +0000"

Globally renowned economic magazine, The Economist, has forecast that Nepal’s economic growth rate will be 6.9 per cent the next year.
The magazine, in its The World in 2020 issue released last week, claims that Nepal’s growth will be faster than India, which will have a growth rate of 6.7 per cent. However, it will be slower than the growth of Bangladesh, predicted to be at the rate of 7.7 per cent.
The magazine has listed Nepal in the eighth position among the fastest 10 growers that include Bangladesh, Nepal and India from the South Asian region.
Though the listing among the fastest growers seems encouraging, the magazine’s forecast is lower than the government target. The government had set a target of 8.5 per cent economic growth in its annual budget plan for the current fiscal year. Earlier this month, the government revised the target and made it 7.01 per cent.
Meanwhile, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have estimated the growth rate to be at 7.1 per cent for the current fiscal year.",/business,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 06:04:40 +0000"

Kathmandu, November 25
New statistics have shown that Nepal is the third biggest source of education income for Australia, after China and India.
Australian Education Minister Dan Tehan informed last week that international education contributed 37.6 billion Australian dollars to the Australian economy last financial year, which was a $5 billion increase.
According to the ministry’s report, Nepal is the third-largest contributor to the education income as it provided 2.6 billion Australian dollars to the country. The two biggest contributors are China and India (12.1 billion and 5.5 billion Australian dollars respectively).
As per the current exchange rate, the amount Nepalis paid to Australia is around Rs 202.8 billion. It is around 13 per cent of the country’s annual budget for the current fiscal year (Rs 1.532 trillion).
Of late, Australian universities are lowering their standard to attract more Nepali and Indian students, according to media reports. However, the minister claims in his press release, “Australians should be proud of our innovative international education sector… It is our largest service-based export and supports 240,000 jobs, business opportunities and economic growth.”

After a dispute with India over the new system introduced to tighten pesticide residue testing on imported fruits and vegetables earlier this year, the government has finally started preparations to introduce the testing system at all border points including the Tribhuvan International Airport.
The TIA, nine Nepal-India crossings and two Nepal-China crossings will soon have such a technology installed, according to Mohan Krishna Maharjan, a spokesperson for the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control.

Meanwhile, the department also sent some of its staff to India to learn more about such technologies.
Earlier in July-August, media had reported that the government of Nepal withdrew from its pesticide residue testing plan owing to India’s pressure. However, the government has been claiming that the plan was put off to prepare necessary infrastructures and technologies first.

10,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kaira-movie-review-an-average-love-story-to-avoid.html,"
With the onset of monsoon, there are a lot of romantic movies being released in Kathmandu. After Romeo and Muna failed to attract the crowd last week, it was the Aryan Sigdel-starrer Kaira that tested its luck at the multiplexes in the Valley and around the country.
The romantic movie revolves around two characters Jay (Aryan Sigdel) and Kaira (Samragee Shah) who accidentally meet at a bar in Kathmandu. In a topsy-turvy journey, both seem to be ‘lucky’ in all matters except for romantic relationships. The story takes a turn when both of them meet in the Philippines where their love story deepens. What happens next changes and both an emotional ride begins.
The first half of the movie was quite engaging with the director showing the audience how the two characters met and the story behind the growth of their friendship. The half was gripping but there seemed to be something missing as the director tried to show a lot of things. Like most Nepali movies, Kaira too didn’t have an element of surprise–the story Was quite predictable.
The second half of the film failed to live up to expectations and lost its audience halfway through. The story got a bit intense and sad but it was over-stretched.

One good thing that stands out in the movie is the acting. It shows how much the actors have worked on getting their role right. Shah is good and so is as Kaira. Her acting is good, especially in the emotional scenes where she’s poised and natural. I didn’t think she Samragyee had it in her to play such an emotional role.
Sigdel, like always, is natural and calm throughout the film. His dialogue delivery, along with his expressions, is good. What is commendable is the flawless chemistry between the duo.
Other actors like Shishir Rana, Hitesh Sharma, Tsuresh Neupane and Marisha Shrestha are not as natural as the main cast but have complimented the two.
What is poor is the script which seems to have been inspired by a lot of Bollywood and Hollywood flicks. The story is quite good and gripping, but the way it has been presented is poor and shows a lack of originality. The screenplay does not do justice to the story which makes it a bit of a drag and makes the audience wish it was over as many left before the film ended. If not for the actors’ hard work, the movie would have been a poor watch as there a lot of faults with the planning of scenes and sequences throughout the film.
The songs are good as they feature a host of good singers such as Sugam Pokharel, Yubraj Chaulagain, Ketan Chhetri and Shreya Sotang. The cinematography is exemplary with Shivaram Shrestha capturing all the beautiful places in the Philippines elegantly. The wardrobe used is quite good too except for a few scenes in which you feel that Sigdel’s dress up is a bit over the top.
Overall, the movie is borderline average. Having expected so much from it, it disappoints.

11,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/kaala-movie-review-rajni-steals-the-show.html,"
South Indian movies being screened in a Kathmandu multiplex is a rare site.  Apart from Bahubali, not many have done well when shown to the public. But at a time when Nepali movies aren’t doing good business, bringing Rajnikant starrer Kaala seems like a no brainer.
The movie revolves around Kaala (Rajnikant), the don who rules one of the slums of Mumbai named Dharavi. Due to its central location, many builders want to take over the land and promise the people migrated from Tamil Nadu new houses. But the story takes a turn when Kaala sees the plans of these builders and opposes them. This makes him a prime target of the builders and a local politician Hari Dada (Nana Patekar) who want to eliminate him in order to get the land.
The first half of the movie is engaging and intense. It focuses on how we believe that by destroying, we can develop a case that has been seen here in Nepal too. It shows the hardships of the people who live in the slum. It shows how the people are brainwashed into selling their houses in return for fake promises.
The second half, even though it has a lot of action, is less engaging than the first as the audience can predict most of what is to come. The ending is a bit confusing and could have been better but the movie does end on a positive note giving the audience plenty to think about.

Superstar Rajni is superb like he was in his previous movie Kabali in which he was fighting for the rights of Tamil workers in Malaysia. His acting is natural and has that certain charisma that he has always shown. He has helped the director sell the movie which focuses more on the people of the slum than Rajnikant. But that said, Rajni is flawless, particularly in the action scenes on a fly over in which he rolls back the year and that too in slow motion with an umbrella in hand.
Nana Patekar as Hari Dada, the corrupt politician, is quite superb. He is natural and has played the role of an antagonist with grace. His confrontations with Kaala are terrific to watch, particularly the part in which he refuses to drink water in Kaala’s house.
Zareena (Huma Qureshi) who plays the role of Kaala’s ex-girlfriend and a social worker has also performed very well. Her acting is powerful and the chemistry between her and Rajnikant is worth admiring.
Eeshwari Rao (As Kaala’s wife) and Anjali Patil (As Kaala’s son’s girlfriend), also put in noteworthy performances.
The background score has been well planned and is quite good along with the songs in the movie which have been timed well but could have been a bit short.
The cinematography is brilliant as all action scenes are flawless. George Williams gives the film a polish that makes it very slick.
Kala is a movie that stars Rajnikant, but is not a movie about him or his character. It’s a movie about the people of Dharavi and how they make ends meet by doing manual labour. It’s a story about how the blue coloured people help maintain the city and how the city fails to function without them.
Most Rajini fans might find Kaala a bit dull. But the nearly three-hour film has the potential to grow on those many audacious departures from the norm. Kaala is a film for the people and the fact that Rajnikant is there is just a bonus.

12,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hari-movie-review-this-artistic-experiment-may-not-sell-in-cheesy-market.html,"
For a second week running, Nepali movie lovers have been treated with a movie that producers hardly consider making. Producers normally make movies which are either funny or are full of cheesy love stories because they know that these movies will sell and their investment is safe.
Breaking that trend, filmmakers have come up with a different movie which is sure to give the audience a new experience.
The movie Hari revolves around Bishnu Hari (Bipin Karki), a religious man in his early 30s who lives with his mother Parvati (Sunita Thakur). Hari’s life is pretty laid back as he has no worries, apart from his receding hairline and an oversmart colleague at work. The story takes a turn a bird ‘shits’ on his head, which also brings bad luck to his life.
The first half of the movie establishes Hari as the lead character. It gives the audience an insight into Hari’s monotonous life and his family history. Like the trailer, it’s abrupt and fails to answer many questions. Apart from a few jokes, the half is not very engaging as there is a feel that something big is going to happen in the second half of the film.
The second half though is just a continuation of the slow first half which fails to grab the audience’s attention but does get better with its various twists and turns. The fact that the directors have connected the characters helps the audience make sense of this playlike movie.
Bipin Karki, the star of this movie, had said this movie gave him artistic pleasure and he has done his role justice. He’s almost ever present in all scenes as he has played five roles in the movie, but there are times one feels he has performed better when not being Hari. The movie starts and ends with him and if you’re not his fan, you best not watch the movie.

Over the years, the audience has seen Karki in many roles as he has established himself as a versatile actor. We’ve seen him as Bindu in Chhadke, Bhasme Don in Pashupati Prassad, Pittal in Loot 2 and Goldie Don in Naakaa, but his role in Hari stands out from his previous roles.
Thinley Lhamo in her second Nepali movie has done well. Even though she has no dialogues, her emotions and expressions stand out. Sunita Thakur, who plays Hari’s mother, has given a stellar performance too along with Kamal Mani Nepal, who plays the role of Hari’s adversary naturally.
Safal KC and Pratik Gurung have done a good job with the direction as they have planned out most shots very well and the lighting is particularly noteworthy.
The story, however, could have been better. Although both KC and Gurung have tried to keep the audience hooked, the slow presentation makes it hard not to use the phone time and again.
The cinematography is what keeps the movie alive. Chintanraj Bhandari has captured most scenes very well and there is hardly anything bad one can point out.
Overall the movie is a good watch if one watches it with an open mind. If you’re looking for something entertaining, then there are other movies in the multiplexes you can watch. But if you’re looking to watch a unique Nepali movie with an artistic touch, Hari should definitely be on your list as this is more like play than a movie.

13,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sunkesari-movie-review-predictable-and-boring.html,"
There was a lot of hype surrounding Sunkesari but the movie has failed to live up to that hype mainly because of its poor storyline and script.
Having watched the producers and actors promote the movie so vigorously, many would have thought the movie would change the way people look at Nepali movies. But after watching Sunkesari the audience would have realised that Nepali movies disappoint more often than others.
The ‘horror’ movie is set in a mansion-turned-boutique-hotel in Australia where Sunkesari (Reecha Sharma) goes to take a break from her sad life. Yadav (Rabindra Jha) a housemaid is the only person in the huge mansion which seems to be haunted. Soon Sunkesari is joined by two more guests Rupen (Sunny Dhakal) and Emma (Lauren Lofberg) after which strange paranormal events begin to unfold.
The start of the movie is abrupt, clichéd and fails to give context. The start is decent but the writer and director Arpan Thapa fails to explain what is happening and why it is happening. The first half gradually gets better thanks to Rabindra Jha’s acting but the filmmakers have failed to scare the audience even though they have used loud sounds and spooky background sound.
The second half of the film has been rushed. With a runtime of 1 hour and 30 minutes, the movie fails to explain a number of things such as the background story of Rupen and Sunkesari.

The acting in the movie isn’t that great either. Sharma as Sunkesari is par and has delivered a flat performance. She seems to be lost and her turning into the ghost is so unnatural that it will make you laugh–especially when she ‘levitates’.
The movie introduces a foreign actor Lauren Lofberg who seems to have done a decent job but again the writing doesn’t help her. Thapa doesn’t seem to have thought about how to incorporate a foreign character before writing the film. But Lofberg as a ghost looks good and far more convincing than Sharma is.
Jha as Yadav is the most entertaining character in the film without whom the movie would have been a drag. The rest of the characters are unnatural and lack identity. The two ghost girls are good as they have done justice to their roles.
The cinematography is good along with the location and is the only thing that makes you feel that you’re watching a horror movie. The movie has been shot by both Nepali and foreigners–both seem to have done a good job to make sure the movie gave a spooky feel.
The writing though was poor and cliched as Thapa offers nothing new. He seems to have rushed the movie from start to finish as he fails to explain many plots. There are two songs in the film which are out of place, pointless and extremely unnatural. Maybe watching too many Bollywood horror movies made the director put them in the film.
Overall the movie fails to live up to the expectation. Its predictable and that makes it funny. The people in the hall were extremely disappointed as they expected more. The movie with his impressive promotion might have done well at the box office but its success there will not make the movie great.
There are signs that there will be a sequel but how many will watch it after such a disappointing prequel is a question for the filmmakers to answer.
P.S.: A+ for the effort.

Superhero movies are making money these days. After the success of Black Panther and Avengers Infinity War, Marvel Studios have come up with yet another superhero movie which is sure to tickle all your funny bones thanks to Ryan Reynolds’ superb performance as ‘Deadpool’.
Deadpool 2, like its predecessor, revolves around the story of a foul-mouthed mutant mercenary Wade Wilson aka ‘Deadpool’ (Reynolds) who has lost everything. He tries to bring together a team of fellow mutant rogues to protect a young boy blessed with supernatural abilities from the brutal, time-travelling mutant, Cable. But the story takes a dramatic turn when Cable has a change of heart. The events that follow will surely surprise everyone.
The first instalment of Deadpool didn’t seem to please the critics with its humour and to rectify that, the new movie has a bit more than just humour. The sequel has a better storyline and that makes this movie better than the first one as it shows the other side of the persona of Deadpool.
The story flows from start to finish. There is no confusion and the humour compliments the good storyline. The first movie had a lot of pop culture references which were hard to understand. But this one has better jokes (still inappropriate), which people can relate to. And this one also offers surprising depth and handles the story of the troubled teenage character with grace.
Reynolds as Deadpool is hilarious. It seems like he has learned from his first movie and added something more to his acting than just jokes. He showed that even a troubled superhero like him can have emotions and is particularly good in the second half of the film.

Julian Dennison as Firefist is good and delivers a stellar performance as a tough teenager who’s been dealt a rough hand at an orphanage.
Josh Brolin as a mutant from the future is just as good but if you look at it the movie is all about Reynolds as you can’t take your eye (and ears) off him.
The action scenes are quite brilliant throughout the movie (not that it was any worse in the first movie). Some scenes do look painful and the fact that the censor board hasn’t cut the film too much makes it much better.
For the brilliant action sequences, we can thank director David Leitch who has specialised in action films after his hit movies Atomic Blond and John Wick. You can expect the same hyper-real fantasia of the first film. Leitch and Reynolds (who also contributes as a writer) throw everything at it as they let your imagination wander.
If you liked the first movie, you’ll surely enjoy watching this one as it offers the same humour but on a larger scale.

PS: Don’t miss the post-credits and yea please leave your kids at home!

Nepali movies are full of surprises. One doesn’t know what to expect from them. The trailers give out very little as one can expect numerous twists and turns while watching one. But Kabir Khadka starrer Lamphoo is a movie that can be judged by its trailer. Like the trailer, the movie is abrupt, haphazard and downright boring.
Lamphoo revolves around Ramesh (Kabir Khadka), a carefree unemployed boy in the town of Kusma. Looking at where he is going, his parents constantly nag him and don’t let him peruse his dream which leaves him frustrated. He is fed up with life and spends with his friends who constantly get him into trouble. But his life changes when he meets Aarati (Mariska Pokhrel) who desperately wants him to change the way he lives life.
But that doesn’t go as planned, as he is tricked by his friends because of whom he has to leave the girl and the town and go to Kathmandu where his life changes drastically when he gets into the trap of selfish people. There are only two ways left for Ramesh, either surrender or fight with them.
The movie starts abruptly. It feels like a few scenes are randomly put together as it lacks proper planning and execution. The first half is extremely long and pretty avoidable. It focuses on Ramesh and his bid to get Aarati to like him which stretches so long the audience stops paying attention and the interval comes as a welcome break.
The long first half results in a confusing second half, which makes one wonder if the filmmakers themselves watched the movie before releasing it. It is full of twists and turns, but that makes the audience scratch their heard wondering what exactly is going on.
The script is poor and has been written by someone who clearly lacks experience. The director hasn’t been helped by the script, but the way he has introduced so many characters in such an abrupt manner makes one question his ability as well.
The actors are average. Khadka is decent as lead but the way he is presented is quite odd and apart from his chemistry with his little brother, there is nothing good to talk about.
Pokharel in the movie is decent, but she could have been better especially while portraying emotions in the film. Her chemistry with Khadka is poor.
Salon Basnet, who is introduced as Lekin in the second half, fails to live up to expectations. He has tried to lighten the mood with his witty acting, but at times goes over the top with his acting. That said, he is the only actor in the movie who has done a good job.
Sanjit Bhandari is poor as Dipak, a rich businessman. His acting is unnatural and his chemistry with Chandani Sharma is quite poor.

The movie also has a special cameo for ‘Tarkariwali’, Kusum Shrestha, whose photo of carrying vegetables had gone viral last year. She doesn’t have a big role and appears in a few shots making it obvious that her name has been used for promotion purposes.
Director Gopal Chandra Lamichhane is particularly off with his direction. He has haphazardly introduced characters and has also failed to explain few plots especially after the climax which seems to have been rushed.  He also randomly adds songs to the movie which is the primary reason that the movie is so long.
The cinematographer is just poor, particularly during the action scenes which have not been planned well. There are a few blurred and shaky shots along with a night shot where one of the characters is barely visible.
Above all, the flow of the script prepared by Bhupati is weak and it is evident that he clearly needs to work on his dialogues if he wants to do well as a scriptwriter. What these writers need to learn is how and where to add English into a Nepali film. The use of English in this movie is odd and very unnatural.
The only saving grace are the songs which are quite nice and are doing well but their placement in the film is out of place.
To sum up, the movie is not worth a watch. It’s a movie that will give aspiring actors a hope that even they can someday make it in this industry which doesn’t seem to be evolving.

Nepali movies these days have a similar storyline that revolves around money. If it isn’t about money, it is about mimicking films made in India or abroad. Most of the producers fear of losing money–no one wants to think outside the box and break the trend.
However, once in a while a movie comes along to challenge this. Damaru Ko Dandibiyo, which was released across Nepal on Friday, is one movie that brings in a gust of fresh air into the cinema industry.
Damaru ko Dandibiyo revolves around the forgotten sport of dandibiyo. Damaru (Khagendra Lamichhane) returns to his village with an aim to revive dandibiyo. But his father, once a reputed dandibiyo player, opposes him and tells him to concentrate on his career.
Damaru is left with no option but to defeat his father in a dandibiyo match to pursue his dream. But that doesn’t go to plan as his father defeats him and in the match and he leaves the village thinking it’s better to quit.
Damaru ko Dandibiyo is directed by Chhetan Gurung–this is his debut movie. Both the writer (Lamichhane) and the director have done a stellar job in showing the audience what ‘the lost sport’ is about. The strong script keeps the audience engaged and the tone in which the movie is shot compliments the script.
The first half of the film teaches the audience about dandibiyo and its rules. The second half was equally good and engaging as all those present in the hall wanted to know if Damaru would revive the sport or not.
All the actors have given stellar performances. Lamichhane, in the lead role, comes out with his best. His natural acting throughout the film makes him stand out from the rest of the cast.

Along with Lamichhane, Anup Baral who plays the role of Damaru’s father is equally good. His seriousness in the first half of the film is worth admiring as well as his role as coach in the second half.
Menuka Pradhan gives a powerful performance as Mala. She was particularly good in the emotional scenes where the rest of the cast were a bit weak. But the lack of chemistry between her and Lamichhane was visible. Supporting actor Buddhi Tamang is his natural self and has given another decent performance along with Ashant Sharma and Laxmi Bardewa who have done justice to their respective roles.
The background scores and the music in the film are good and they do not feel out of place. The cinematography is simple as the cinematographer has captured all scenes well, especially the dandibiyo matches that take place in the second half.
To sum it up, the movie is a worth a watch. It’s quite disheartening that more movies like these aren’t being made. The movie informs the audience about the country’s de facto national sport. Maybe this movie will encourage youngsters to take up the sport.

A recent trend in the Nepali film industry: rope in a group of well-known actors and give them funny roles to play. The reason: people will come watch the movie no matter how boring it may be. Kohalpur Express–I’m not surprised–does not buck the trend, even at the cost of creativity and presentation.
The story begins with SP (Buddhi Tamang), Krishna (Binod Neupane) and Salo Keto planning to kidnap (Rabindra Jha) Agrawal’s son. The mastermind behind this kidnapping is an expecting mother Champa (Priyanka Karki) who wants to have a happy life. She believes that looting a rich and corrupt man is the only way to do it without trampling on her ‘morals’.
But the story takes a turn when kidnappers SP, Krishna and Salo Keto get injured and Kohalpur Express (Keki Adhikari) has to kidnap the kid. However, all goes horribly wrong after she not only picks up the wrong kid, but also loses the ransom money.
Initially, you think the movie is quite nice. But when you realise the movie is an adaptation of the Kamal Hassan-starer Mumbai Express, the movie loses its appeal. Apart from a handful of sequences and dialogues, the movie offers nothing different. It revolves around the same narrative Nepali films normally play around money.
Keki Adhikari, also the producer of the film, has done a decent job as she plays the role of a woman who has difficulty hearing–she can do no wrong. But that said, she has no proper emotions in the movie and is always serious.
Karki is good as usual but her role of an angry pregnant woman is not as good it could have done. At times you wonder: Why is she is always mad? But her chemistry with Tamang does look genuine, unlike her ridiculously large belly.
Tamang doesn’t have a huge role but he makes you laugh with his usual witty dialogues. He is slowly becoming the Brahmanandam Kanneganti of Nepali movies.
Reecha Sharma is just odd. Her role of Agrawal’s second wife is awkward and she is too loud most of the times and overdoes things with her expressions.
The other actors are bearable. Child actor Kushagra Bhattarai gives a good performance but needs to work on his emotions in the future. Neupane, in a different role, has done quite well and pulled off the role of a stammerer with grace.

The script and screenplay are more than just an adaptation of Mumbai Express, so there’s not a lot one can talk about them. The positive aspect of the movie is that the writer has keeps the suspense under the wraps pretty effectively. The cinematography is quite good like all movies being made these days.
The music is not so great. The song ‘C-O-W Cow’ has received over 8 million views on YouTube. All other songs in the film are a just there to prolong the runtime.
The background score given by Rohit Shakya is good, especially the title song.

Multiplexes in Kathmandu are screening yet another romantic movie this week, the much-awaited Lily Bily. The movie starring popular actor Pradeep Khadka and debutante Jasita Gurung has been directed by Milan Chams.
This ‘rom-com’ revolves around the story of two characters Avash (Pradeep Khadka) and Shruti(Jasita Guring) who meet at a restroom at a cinema hall in Scotland. Both come from different family backgrounds–with their own baggage of emotions. During an unusual and interesting journey, they start to look for their soul mate inside one another before falling in love. But the story takes a turn when they find out the truth about one another.
The first half of the movie is avoidable and lacks substance and good writing. The start is abrupt as the movie loses the audience in the first half itself. The dialogues are clichéd and the sound is poorly dubbed.
The first half ends on a cliffhanger–it is the only reason people stick around to watch the movie. The story in the second half gets better, but again clichéd dialogues and screenplay leaves many in the hall restless and bored.
Pradeep Khadka has tried to do his best in a movie which he should never have signed up for. Rather than playing similar type of movies, he should have tried different roles to showed his versatility. But he had a movie to forget.

Jasita Gurung is below par and had a debut to forget. Her lack of experience in the field was the reason for such a mediocre performance–something the director must have noticed while shooting. All she does in the movie is cry from start to finish and brings nothing new to the table as she gives a flat performance.
Priyanka Karki does her best in a short cameo and the gulf in class and experience between her and Gurung os glaring. Anoop Bikram Shahi can be seen in a negative role again, but again his role was so short that nothing can be made of it.
The reason the actors were bad has to be the story. It plays on the same of narrative that we’ve been watching for decades. The writer of the film hasn’t tried anything different and has been lazy with both the dialogues and the screenplay. The only thing that makes it different is that it’s been shot in a foreign land.
The cinematography could have been better. Most of the film was shot in Scotland, which is an extremely picturesque and they have shown that. But it could have been done by literally anyone. There are times when the shot jump from one place to another without explaining why.
When it comes to romantic movies, at least the songs are good, but it’s not the case when it comes to Llily Bily. The songs aren’t any good and the choreography is just avoidable.
To sum it up, the movie doesn’t leave a good impression. One thing can be learned from the film: Shooting a flick in a foreign location doesn’t make it better. There are a lot of factors that make a movie great and this movie does not have any of it.

19,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/timi-sanga-movie-review-cliched-tale-of-friendship-love-and-sacrifice.html,"The story revolves around three characters, all from different walks of life destined to travel together. Niti (Samragyee RL Shah) is an NRN visiting Nepal for the first time and she meets Shuvam (Aakash Shrestha). He is her guide for her trek to Poon Hill. Bharat Raj Mishra (Najir Husen), an unusual trekker from Terai with his own personal mission, meets Niti and Shuvam on the way. During their journey, they go through unexpected love and emotions with each other.
Beginning of the movie Timi Sanga along with the first half is enjoyable as romantic comedies generally are; but there is a feeling that the director got carried away in the second half and stretched it too long. The actors have done a steady job trying to connect with the audience, but they fail to materialise in the second half of the film. One could sense what was coming because the second half of the movie plays on a similar narrative old Hindi movies used to play with corny dialogues in the forefront of it all.
The actors have done a decent job in the film. Fan favourite Samragyee Shah looks to be in her zone playing the role of an NRN. Acting as the lead in her third film, she has come a long way since her debut movie Dreams. Her attitude stands out in the film along with her acting in some of the emotional scenes.
Najir Hussain like always is brilliant with his witty acting and powerful dialogue delivery. One can’t help but feel that without him and his constant jokes, the movie would have been difficult to watch.

Acting in his second film, Aakash Shrestha also looks in his zone as his chemistry with Shah stands out. But there are times his inexperience shows especially during some emotional scenes. That said he also needs to dance better if he wasn’t to be a versatile actor.
The actors, however, have been let down by a poor script. The storyline has been thought of well but the dialogues are not as good. Some are witty and makes you laugh but most are frail and uninspired.
The film is over two hours long thanks to a number of songs, most of which are futile and drag the movie making the audience restless. The song ‘Man Ma Ago’ was needless and maybe would have been popular a few decades ago. Romantic movies do need songs but apart from ‘Ladyo Ladyo’. The rest of them are below average along with the background scores.
The cinematography is good given it was shot in such picturesque destination around the Annapurnas. However, they have done nothing new in the film and one can notice ‘grains’ during some night shots which makes it clear that the director didn’t give enough attention to details. Along with that, dubbing is equally bad as the audio isn’t in sync with the visuals.
Influenced by romantic Bollywood films, the movie isn’t a bad watch. The story is good and is engaging thanks to some fine acting by the cast. But with better planning and a shorter script, it could have been much better.

20,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/high-energy-consumption-should-not-be-discouraged-now-ghising.html,"NEA Managing Director Kulman Ghising
Nepal Electricity Authority’s Managing Director Kul Man Ghising is retiring in a few months. When he was promoted to the position in 2016, the country was in a severe power crisis. Nepalis had to endure up to 18 hours of load-shedding every day. However, the regular power outage is a once-upon-a-time story now. Rather, Ghising’s team in the authority is currently advocating for increased energy consumption in Nepal, claiming the country will see more hydropower projects in the next few years.
Onlinekhabar’s Rabindra Ghimire recently talked to Ghising about why he is promoting energy consumption though the country still imports electricity from India.
Excerpts:
Media reports claim that the NEA is in a comfortable position regarding the balance between energy demand and supply. Are you really confident about the company’s capacity to meet the demand?
Let me clarify the confusion first. Some media reports have said that demand is on a steady decline, but it is not true. Every year, the demand falls in October and November, mainly due to two reasons. The first: this period is one of transition–there is not much heat in the southern plains, neither there’s too much cold in the mountains. That’s why consumers don’t operate appliances such as heaters and fans that require heavy load. Besides, there are many festivals such as Dashain, Tihar, Chhath and Bishwakarma Puja. Factories close their operations for such festivals and demand significantly dips.
This is the usual trend. But definitely demand has slightly increased this time, so has the availability of power. The peak demand has not increased above 1,300 megawatt, which is good. Likewise, to maintain balance, many projects are underway to enhance energy efficiency whereas we have run a successful programme to control pilferage.
Daily load management is difficult because the demand amount differs every hour. Currently, our power generation capacity is around 1,200 megawatts, at least during the five months of the monsoon. This year, we also exported around 200-megawatt energy to Bihar because the generation exceeded the demand.
In the monsoon season, we do not need to import energy. Now, the monsoon is over most of our run-of-the-river projects are generating power below par. Hence, we are importing energy for peak hours. However, it is very nominal in comparison to the past. Till April-May next year, the import amount will increase as our production capacity continues decreasing–this has been the trend for every dry season. Despite that, we estimate that the amount of imported power will be less than that of last year.
On the other hand, we are completing some new transmission lines so that we can import power whenever we wish. They will also enable us to enter the Indian energy market for trading. We hope to produce an additional 1,000-megawatt energy by June-July the next year. It means we have to export at least 500 to 600-megawatt power in the monsoon. We are discussing how we can become more efficient in the Indian market next monsoon.
In the winter season, however, we do not have that flexibility. Nonetheless, we have to increase consumption in the domestic market. It means we have to increase the capacity of our distribution systems, substations, transmission lines. We also need to expand the scope of power consumption, for example to cooking. We are studying all these issues.
We believe that a certain volume of energy, at least 15 to 20 per cent of the demand, should remain on reserve. We are planning to convert the Indian grid as the reserve margin for us when Nepal is self-reliant to meet the demand. Likewise, our export to India can be a reserve margin for them.
NEA Managing Director Kul Man Ghising
Do you think replacing cooking gas is possible immediately?
Yes, it is possible. Of course, we are still importing energy during the dry season. But, we are also selling it during the monsoon, at a competitive price. If importing helps us improve our economy, we should not consider it negatively.
The government should introduce a demand stimulation plan. It will address the need for increasing domestic demand and adjusting the tariff structure. The current tariff structure discourages high consumption, but it should not be discouraged now.
However, we are clear that we should not change the tariff for the families which use the least amount of electricity every month–power is a lifeline for them. There are more than 1.2 million customers who pay Rs 3 for one unit of electricity. But at the next level, for the middle-class and upper-class people, the amount of consumption and the tariff rate should be inversely proportional–the more they consume, the lower the rate they are charged.
Likewise, we are thinking of using smart metres, which calculate different rates for different times of a day, for example, power goes quite expensive during peak hours. Such technology also helps us maintain balance. We can also calculate the tariff differently for different seasons, for example, it should be cheap in the monsoon.
You are thinking of imposing a higher rate for the customers who use less energy. But recently, a report has claimed Nepal’s electricity is the most expensive in South Asia already. 
I don’t accept that our energy is the most expensive in South Asia. You cannot compare us with Bhutan because it has so much surplus amount and has earned a lot by exporting energy to India. Consequently, people get power at subsidised rates. I don’t think you can compare Nepal with Bangladesh also because it also has so many subsidised schemes. India has different rates for different districts; but, overall, the rate is higher.
Our energy is not expensive. The current tariff is not benefitting us; it is just enough to maintain a breakeven. The amount that we earned in profit recently comes from other sources like interests paid by the projects of our investments. The tariff does not contribute to our profit.
Apparently, we should sell it at a higher rate than our purchase. Our average cost price is Rs 7.5 per unit, but we are selling it for Rs 3 to 5, not only for the lower-class domestic consumers.  Industrial enterprises are using power for Rs 4.15 per unit during nighttime. On average, a factory in Birgunj pays Rs 7.64 per unit; we buy it from Bihar at the rate of Rs 10 whereas domestic hydropower projects have different rates, as much as Rs 15.
Do you think the authority is ready for some subsidy schemes like in other countries if the government wants?
Rather than subsidies, we are working for a scientific tariff that will increase our demand, meet our revenue target and make the energy cheaper in the long run. We have a plan for that.
You said the current tariff is already enough to maintain a breakeven for the company. So why are you looking for increasing the revenue target? As a government authority, you are not supposed to earn any profit.
We have assets worth Rs 400 billion, but we are in debt of Rs 200 billion. We have to pay for its interest regularly. Also, look at our long-term liability. We have around 12,000 staff; of them, around 6,000 are entitled to the pension for the entire life.
If the authority is stronger, it can invest in other projects. It can build new hydro projects. There are costs involved in the maintenance of substations and other infrastructures. I agree that we should not look for any big profit like a private company, but we need profit at a certain level so that we can also catch any reinvestment opportunities.
We are not distributing our profit to the staff; we are investing it for people. If we had earned a profit of Rs 20 billion, the authority could have built the Budhi Gandaki project on its own. That would have been another benefit for the country and its people.
When the authority grows self-sustained, the government can channelise its money that it earlier used to give to the authority to other sectors like education, health, and roads.",/interview,"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 07:06:02 +0000"
21,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/its-time-to-restructure-conservation-area-projects-in-nepal-says-conservationist-writer.html,"
Broughton Coburn of Wilson, Wyoming has worked in conservation and development projects in Nepal, Tibet and India for the four decades, for a variety of international agencies. In Nepal, he worked for the establishment of the Annapurna Area Conservation Project (ACAP), which attracts thousands of tourists, domestic and foreign, every year.
Ahead of the government’s ambitious Visit Nepal Year 2020, Coburn recently spoke to  Onlinkhabar about his time in ACAP and how conservation areas in Nepal are facing an uncertain future.
Excerpts:
How did you get into ACAP?
I came to Nepal as a Peace Corps volunteer and was posted in Syangja, where I lived with an elderly Gurung woman, and wrote two books about her life.  Then I got the chance to work with the Agriculture Department’s Division of Soil Science on a USAID-funded project in which we explored the potential for biogas (gobar gas). I played a small role in that, but am proud to say that there are nearly 200,000 operating, self-sustaining gobar gas plants in Nepal, now. I also worked with UNESCO in Sagarmatha National Park.
What were your first works in conservation?
I became associated with King Mahendra’s Trust for Nature Conservation (later renamed the National Trust for Nature Conservation), and ACAP was one of their lead projects. This ambitious effort resulted in Nepal’s first “conservation areas”, and was gazetted in 1988.  Again, I played a small role, and need to give a big shout out to Dr. Hemanta Raj Mishra, Dr. Chandra Prasad Gurung, and Dr. Mingma Norbu Sherpa. Chandra and Mingma and I toured the Annapurna region, gathering information and speaking with villagers and village leaders. We then started looking at various development plans and objectives. Tragically, Chandra and Mingma were killed in the devastating helicopter crash in the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area a number of years ago.
Looking at it now, aren’t you disappointed that it doesn’t run with the same values as it did back then?
I would say that as ACAP has grown, it has become a bit bureaucratic, and is not operating at the same level of motivation and energy it once had.  But this can happen as any organization grows and matures, and eventually ages.  Perhaps it is time to re-design or re-configure it, to address the changing economic and environmental situations in Nepal — and breathe new life into it?
What are the major challenges for an organisation like these?
Well, the major challenges I see concern growth and development. I believe growth is outpacing ACAP and other conservation areas’ abilities to manage the resources in a sustainable manner. More specifically, the Act and regulations underpinning ACAP expire on January 17, 2020.  I’m not sure that ACAP staff are entirely certain what will happen next. But with careful planning they can hopefully re-configure an ACAP that will re-engage conservation productively and strive to achieve the project’s original goals.

Is the area too big? Can it not be broken down so works can be done more effectively?
I personally feel that ACAP might be too big, and that it has potential for being redefined and restructured. Maybe we were too ambitious in the 1980s in drawing such large boundaries. I wonder if some of the villages along ACAP’s southern border areas would necessarily need to be included a slimmed-down, re-designed protected area, one that focuses more on core management zones that are enduring the heaviest impact from tourism and development.  But there are likely political considerations involved, and this adjustment may be difficult to propose. Especially in Dr. Chandra’s and Dr. Mingma’s absence, and in the spirit of their tireless work, I have offered to help ACAP in whatever limited way I can with the future design process. I see great potential for re-formulating an exciting new ACAP.
Is money also a problem? No one wants to give up on it.
Well, that is one of the problems. No one wants to give up the ACAP royalty revenue stream, so there are likely to be some political tussles with that.
What about the roads? Are they affecting the conservation areas?
It’s discouraging that ACAP (and MCAP, where I was recently) do not have the power to enforce the commissioning of environmental impact assessments for the roads that are penetrating even the most remote corners. From what I’ve gathered, those who propose EIAs, or raise questions about road approval and alignment, are regarded as anti-development. ACAP gets this accusation whenever they raise questions. Conducting the EIA and enforcing the recommendations is part of their mission, along with overseeing and monitoring the environmental standards of the roads that are coming into ACAP and MCAP.
Trekkers complain that the motor road has killed the trails. Do you feel so?
Along some sections of the “alternate” trek routes — the trails that typically bypass the road or travel on the opposite bank of the river — trekking can be tricky or dangerous. Himalayan rivers are prone to landslides, and if slides take out a road, every effort will be made to clear it.  But typically trail maintenance budgets are inadequate to clear large landslides that don’t impact a motor road. After some years, the alternate trekking routes may become unpassableas where they encounter deep landslide scars.
Your thoughts on conservation area projects in general?
I recently visited the Manaslu Conservation Area (MCAP).  As someone involved in the early stages of ACAP, I was disappointed to see virtually no rangers patrolling in the higher elevation areas, and lack of management is evident. If there is an intention to follow the mission of providing for sustainable development, alongside the goal of preserving the environment, I feel there will need to be more attention applied to the environmental and conservation side of the equation.
Why do you think that’s the case? These places get thousands of tourists every year who pay a lot to get in. Yet the area is polluted and the trails are bad. Have they been following conservation ethics?
These questions should be posed to the NTNC, ACAP and MCAP.  They have established the Conservation Area Management Committees (CAMCs), which are doing a good job in many areas, and they have received support from the Hariyo Ban Project, but in some areas environmental protection efforts have been inadequate.
I sense that they’re interested largely in the revenue that tourists bring in. Our group of nine people recently paid $1,900 in permit fees to the NTNC.  I would like to ask where the money goes and how it is used.
Could you share some incidents that you saw there, in MCAP?
I saw an employee working for a new lodge above Samdo run down to the river with a bag of garbage — plastic bottles, tin cans, papers — and dump it all directly into the river, sending it downstream. I had a talk with the lodge manager, who said that “it’s just the way it is.”
And near Bimthang (ACAP side of the Larkya La), I saw uncontrolled goat and sheep grazing. Arguably, goats, which are very destructive, don’t belong in a pristine, bio-diverse protected area. The farmer told me that he doesn’t pay any fee to ACAP, and that there is no restriction on goat grazing.  In landslide-prone areas, small livestock can also trigger landslides, and our group had to dodge falling rocks triggered by grazing goats.
By the way, what brings you back to Nepal?
Every other year or so, I return to visit the Manaslu Conservation Area Project, partly because we have an adopted son who is from the area, so I am keen to follow the socio-economic changes and developments, and to observe livestock management and agricultural techniques.  Of course, the advent of a motor road into the area will have a transformative effect on the valley.",/interview,"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 04:45:06 +0000"

Paras Khadka, who stepped down as captain of the national cricket team, is not playing the series against MCC. However, Khadka, who is preparing to go to Dubai to play the T-10 league, is ever-present at the TU Cricket Ground to cheer up his teammates.
On Wednesday, Onlinekhabar’s Raj Kumar Shrestha caught up with Khadka and spoke to him about why he didn’t play this series, his aspiration in the T-10 league and his future plans. Excerpts:
The team you’ve captained for a decade is playing right now but you’re not a part of it. How does it feel to watch the team from the stands? 
When I resigned I had said that I wanted a break from international cricket. That is why I’m not playing. But as a player, it doesn’t feel great to not be playing. If you talk to any player, they will tell you that they want to be playing. When you play, the feeling is different from that when you are on the sidelines. But I’m enjoying watching our boys play in whites. It’s been a while since Nepal played three-day cricket, which in itself is good for us going forward.
Don’t you think the team needs you during this transition phase? Why aren’t you playing? 
I’d asked the management to not put my name in the T-20 and three-day squad. However, I did want to play in the 50-over match. Sadly, due to health reasons, I could not play in that one.
So you’re disappointed no to play?
I wouldn’t say disappointed. It’s just part of a cricketer’s life, to be honest. You’ll obviously miss some games in your career. As I missed out, someone else has got a chance to play for Nepal so I wouldn’t stay I am disappointed.
After this, you’re going to Dubai to play the T-10 league. Is it a coincidence that you were selected to take part in the league after you resigned as captain? 
Well, you have to call it a coincidence. I think I received an offer to play the T-10 league five days after I resigned as captain. When the approach was first made, I was quite unsure. I consulted with family, friends, and coaches who told me that it’s a great opportunity and that I should go play.
I had decided to take a break from cricket as a whole, but coaches told me that this was too big an opportunity to miss out on. It’s funny that I left one thing and got something back in return. But as I said, this is just a coincidence.
I’m looking forward to it as well. I want to play and prove to the team that I can do well in the competition. I will be representing Nepal in the league and if I do will it can open doors for other cricketers as well.
Personally, what is your view on T-10 league? 
Well, this is new to me. As a player, you want to play in these global franchise leagues. I’ve got an opportunity and I feel lucky to have got it. It’s a different format and I’m excited. I hope I can justify my team buying me. But that said, I think I’ll play the way that I always play – giving 100 per cent. It’s a good opportunity and I hope more Nepali cricketers will get this opportunity.
Is this the beginning of Paras Khadka’s international franchise career? 
As it’s the first time I’ll be playing international franchise cricket, you can call it the beginning.

Are you hopeful that this will open the door to popular T-20 leagues like IPL, BBL CPL?
That will depend on my performance. I know Nepali cricket fans want players like me to play in these league but it depends on my performances. If you do well, international cricket will recognise you. Which is why my aim is to play good cricket.
Some have been saying that these franchise leagues were not your priority when you were captain. Is that true? 
I feel playing international T-20 leagues like IPL, CPL, and BBL is every cricketer’s dream. Me being captain does not affect that dream I think. But I will say that as a captain you have to think about a lot of things. I’ve tried my best to do what is good for Nepali cricket. Some decisions that I’ve made have been correct and similarly, I have also made some bad decisions.
What feel is right now I can just concentrate on playing cricket and playing well. I have nothing else to worry about and I guess that is going to be fun. Cricket is something that will stay with me for life. I will not be able to go away from it. The best thing for me is the ball hitting the middle of my bat. I want to play cricket. I have no other agenda right now. But I do feel a bit relieved as I am no longer the captain.
Had you wished to be part of the IPL or other leagues for that matter? 
I’d say yes. But if you ask this to any cricketer they will say yes. I wouldn’t just say IPL. No cricketer would say no if you asked him to play in a franchise league. What I feel sad about is we have only been able to play one world cup. We have failed to qualify for the ODI World Cup and have missed out on 2/3 T-20 World Cups. Had we played in these tournaments, we would have had more exposure. I guess it would have opened the door for more competitions. That said, I do feel we can play in these tournaments in the future. I think we are more than capable. But for that, all of us need to come together.
Do you think your performances in Singapore was the reason for your selection in the T-10 league? 
Maybe. Because in cricket they say one catch can change a match and one innings can change a career. Maybe that 100 in Singapore is that innings for me.
Are you talking to Pakistan Super League and other leagues as well? 
I’ve sent my name for the PSL draft. But I don’t know if I’ll be selected. Let’s see what happens. People were asking me if I will play in the Emerging Nations or the T-10. I do feel the country should always come first, but I had already committed to play the T-10 league. I asked our coach Umesh Patwal if it was fine with me playing in the T-10 league and he told me to go. He told me that young players will be given a change instead of me which is why I decided to go to Dubai. But in the future, if the choice is between country and franchise team, I’ll always choose the country.
As you said, one inning can change a player’s career. Can we expect such an inning during the T-10 league? 
I cannot guarantee anything like that. But that said, I will try. In this sport, as you play along you get to create records. For me what’s important is that the team wins.",/interview,"Thu, 07 Nov 2019 09:57:18 +0000"

Anjal Niraula is a distributed solar expert. He is also a member of the Future Energy Leader’s group with the World Energy Council where he works on the Energy Access taskforce. As CEO of Gham Power, one of Nepal’s leading solar companies, he oversees R&D and product strategy, including business development, design, and engineering. He has been with Gham Power since it’s early days in 2010, when Nepal faced a severe power crisis with outages up to 18 hrs a day. Gham Power, which was first established to provide back-up for households during the crisis, now develops solar microgrids in rural areas and in urban areas it is developing itself as an energy service company. Onlinekhabar’s Abhaya Raj Joshi talked to Niraula recently on his company’s work and the way forward for solar power in Nepal, Excerpts:
Let’s start the interview talking about some global issues. The Chinese government recently made some policy changes to slash financial aid to developers after Chinese companies overshot targets. How has this affected your business? In Nepal, most of the PVs are imported from China.
As we all know is the world’s major solar PV producer and the demand and supply in the Chinese market affect markets worldwide, including that in Nepal. The policy change comes at an important time. There was a time when solar power cost around 50-60 cent per watt. But after the Chinese policy change, it dropped to 20-30 cents per watt. Before the price drop, solar was considered as an alternative source of power because of its price. But now we are past the price point where solar power can compete with other power sources. Thanks to the drop in prices, Gham Power can now offer power to its customers at a rate cheaper than that of the government grid. So if we look at the cost involved, it has hit the right price point for us to develop ourselves as an energy service company.
If the policy change had not come, what would have happened?  
Solar PV prices have been falling for a long time and any other trigger would have also done the job. But the Chinese policy made it quicker. I believe that it would have eventually happened. When we started our business, people were using diesel generators as back up for power because the state utility could not supply reliable power. Back then also, solar power asaback-up was cheaper compared to diesel. But it was not considered a mainstream source of power. That is why we chose to go to places where access to grid power was limited to geographical reasons. We built micro-grids in areas where bringing grip power was costlier than setting up solar plants. But with the drop in prices and the restored stability in the grid, the commercial market soon began to look feasible for us.
One big criticism labeled against solar power is that it is not reliable. It depends on the amount of sunshine available.
This is the case with all the renewable energy sources. The amount of solar radiation and wind available to us is not under our control. Same is the case with hydro. The power output is directly related with the water available during different seasons. I think the bigger question most certainly is — how you devise strategies to integrate these intermittent energy sources into the grid which also has a variable demand. Digitisation and storage technology could play a bigger role there.
In the past, Nepal Electricity Authority was considered the sole provider of electricity in the country. But these days, companies such as Gham Power are also providing electricity. How does that work?
Until now, we have developed around 2-3 projects under the model we developed to provide cheaper power (compared to the grid) in urban areas. This model is a bit investment-intensive. We need to seek investors to put their money on such projects. This is a problem we’ll talk about later on.
But what we do is make the model feasible for the customer. We talk to potential clients, look at their roof space, their electricity bill, load profile and calculate the potential power that can be generated using solar PVs. At the moment, we only talk about offsetting the consumers’ dependence on grid electricity by using solar power. When the client signs up with us, they don’t need to pay anything for the solar plant; they pay a certain fee per unit of electricity they receive from our solar plant and after 15 years they get to own the entire system. They no longer have to pay us. As the system works for around 25-30 years, the customers get free power for around 15 years.
We are bearing all the risk and the cost associated with the project that’s why we are keen only on at least 50-100 KW projects. The downside is that if the grid becomes unstable again, we have to think about storage. But what we do is we design the installed capacity of our system to be lower than the actual consumption, so that we don’t have to sell excess power to the grid.
We talked about the fall in PV prices, but what about the batteries? Is that why your project model focuses on day-time offsetting rather than night? 
To some extent yes. If you look at our nation’s peak demand, it occurs during the evening when solar production is not at it’s maximum. So, you eventually have to look at storage as an important part of integrating solar into the grid. But, in Nepal, the battery is still expensive. The tax incentives are still not there so just from an economic standpoint it might not make sense right not if you were to invest in batteries alone.
But, on a positive note, if you look at the international market, the price of batteries is also falling. There is great R&D work being done all over the world and we expect it to drop much more. In the very near future, I fully expect batteries to become a part of our grid and they would help provide much needed stability to the grid.
There was a time when the price of the PV was so high that it did not make economic sense to talk about it in a country where hydro has been the most popular source of energy. But now that the prices have fallen, what are some of the challenges you face in developing solar power projects?
That’s true. A few years ago, when the solar prices were high it was viewed more as an “alternative” source of energy. Either to provide power to remote communities, to have a reliable back-up during loadshedding or to displace diesel. Now when you talk about solar, you can actually start to talk about it in purely economic terms, because it can easily be cheaper than the grid and help you reduce your energy costs. But, for solar to really take off there are multiple challenges especially regulatory that need to be addressed.
First, it seems that government policy and laws related to energy, are framed with only hydropower in mind. Almost all the documentation that you need to submit to the authorities are hydro-related. For example, the EIA requirements of a hydropower plant and a solar plant are inherently different, but they need to have a similar structure. There is no consideration given for distributed solar which can be built on rooftops. So, the legalities around how approvals can be obtained for such projects are a bit vague.
Is finance a problem for companies like Ghampower? 
Yes, it is. Financing solar power projects from a local bank still requires personal guarantees from project promoters despite which this can still be quite a lengthy process.  In this case, companies like Ghampower which do not have the funds to perpetually bank-roll these projects struggle to develop a large portfolio..
The other issue with finance is that foreign direct investment proposals take at least 6-9 months to receive government approval. The threshold of foreign investment has been raised to 5 crore per tranche, which can be hard to obtain for a nascent market. Raising debt into SME’s from commercial foreign investors has also been barred. So, there have been instances where we have had to ask our sales team to actually reduce the size of project that we execute. For example – there was one instance where our client was intent on installing 500 kW of solar, but we had to reduce the size of the project to 200 kW.
Despite the tremendous potential the market holds, these policy bottlenecks have really slowed our path to scale. But, I am very hopeful that with the recently suggested amendments to the Electricity Act and the Foreign Investment Act will allow us to tap into this huge market and deploy cheap, reliable solar power at scale.
How does solar compete with hydro these days?
The beauty of solar is that it is very demand-driven. If you need 10 kw you set-up a 10 kw plant. The installation time is minimal and you can set it up on your roof, however much you need it. And guess what, it can be cheaper than what you are paying for the grid electricity.
Hydropower is definitely going to be the mainstay of energy generation in Nepal for the foreseeable future, and the fact that the National grid is so reliable has actually allowed us to set up these grid connected solar systems. So, in our case solar and hydro are not competing but are complementary to each other.
Distributed solar can help reduce the burden on the distribution infrastructure and bring massive monetary savings in terms of reduced losses and reduction in investment cost towards upgrading of the distribution infrastructure. With the increased electricity consumption planned through Electric vehicles and clean cooking, distributed solar will have a big role to play in allowing the utility to manage this demand. Digitisation is key in managing these distributed systems and creating a more robust grid in the country.
What is your take on the future of the energy market globally?
It’s going to be decentralised, it’s going to renewable and it will be digital. Storage and infrastructure will remain the key.
And for Nepal?
I see solar massive potential. Within a few years solar PVs will be a common sight on all houses in Kathmandu. What we need to do is get all the stakeholders together and focus on building the right policies for the future.

Wolfgang Nairz is a renowned mountaineer and the leader of Austria’s 1978 Everest expedition, in which Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler reached the top of Everest without bottled oxygen.
Nairz first came to Nepal in 1970 and since then has been coming to Nepal on a regular basis. Last week, Nairz arrived in Nepal for the 100th time, becoming probably the first foreigner to do so. Upon arrival, his hosts and fans gave him a ‘hero’s welcome’ at the Kathmandu airport and took him to Thamel on a traditional carriage (baggi). Later, Nairz spoke to Onlinekhabar about his impression of Nepal, how things have changed here and about his projects in the country. Excerpts: 
How does it feel to come to Nepal for the 100th time? 
It doesn’t feel any different actually. It feels like coming back home. It has nearly been 50 years since I came to Nepal for the first time, but the joy I get coming to this country is the same. Initially, I was interested in the mountains, but now I also come for the culture and the people. We have a lot of projects here.
What brings you back every time? 
Well, it has to be people. Over the past 50 years, I’ve met a lot of good people. Along with the people, I’d also say the landscape and the culture and religion. I’d say a harmony between the three.
You came to Thamel riding on a carriage all the way from the airport. How was that feeling?
Incredible. I have some great friends here who have given me a terrific reception on my 100th visit to Nepal. They had told me they were not there, but then everyone was at the airport. It was a great surprise, the one I will never forget. The streets were clean, flowers everywhere. It’s like they had done it not for the Chinese President, but for me.
Nairz riding towards Marsyandi Hotel in Thamel on a carriage arranged for him by his friends.
How have things changed since you first came to now?
A lot has changed. I don’t think you can even imagine how things were during those times. There were only three or four big hotels; others were only small guest houses. We rode only bicycles as there were hardly any cars on the roads. We used to go to Bouddha, Patan and other areas on our bicycles. It was really a different time.
Kathmandu has changed the most. It was much calmer. Now it’s a bit wild. I remember we had to carry our own bags off the plane before going to the immigration office. I’d say the change in Kathmandu is negative. However, the changes in the remote areas have been positive. I think that is all thanks to tourism. It’s helped develop areas like Namche into something better.
How would you describe your Everest expedition in 1978?
I’d say it was difficult. Things are a lot easy now. Back then we had to do a lot of work. When I reached the top of Everest, only 60 climbers had reached the top so you could imagine how tough it was. But we had a good team which had Reinhold Messner among others and I think we did a fairly good job. We had no icefall doctors so we had to fix ropes and also prepare camps. It was not as easy as people have it now. We also did not have communication with the outside world. Any source of communication had to come through Kathmandu first, then fly to Lukla and then to base camp.
Was there pressure to summit Everest? 
There wasn’t actually. We were quite calm. Yes, we did have our fair share of luck thanks to the good weather, but we were good climbers. We knew we had it in us to get to the top of the world’s highest peak. Our Sherpas were quite good too.
What other mountains have you climbed here? 
I’ve been to seven 8,000-metre peaks here in Nepal and led the expedition in all of them. I’ve climbed Manaslu South Face in 1972, which was my first, then Makalu South Face in 1974, Everest in 1978, Ama Dablam in 1979 where we rescued Sir Edmund Hillary’s son. I also summited Dhaulagiri, Cho Oyu South Face.
What have these mountains taught you? 
Well the one lesson that the mountains have given me is that there’s always the next time. It’s taught me that coming back down is as important as going up. I lost a friend during the Dhaulagiri expedition which still hurts me. It’s taught me that every mountain is different and each should be respected individually.
What do you do when you come to Nepal every year? 
The first thing I do is meeting my friends. After that, I go to monitor various projects which I’m funding. We’ve been doing a lot of charity work here, especially after the 2015 earthquake. We’re working on the Hillary Hospital to which my and Messner’s foundation has donated around $400,000. We’re working with Tashi Tenzing and Green Tara Foundation building schools. I also have a Sherpa Project where I take 25 Nepalis from remote areas to Austria and give them lodge management training.
This is a win-win situation for both the lodge owner in Austria who gets human resources and to Nepalis here who can learn a lot by spending three to four months in Austria. They also get a good salary there.
We’re also building schools here. One in Sindupalchok for around 200 children with Tashi Tenzing. In Chilaune of the district, we’ve built another school. We’re also working on a reforestation project in the Khumbu region. We’ve also help build a few cultural monuments in the region so people can go practice their faith there.
Wolfgang with his wife Edith
How do you raise money for these projects? 
Well, my organisation has over 150 members and we do various fundraising activities. We give lectures, attend various programmes which help us get money. If you look at the things post-earthquake, we’ve nearly spent $700,000 rebuilding schools and hospitals in the remotest parts of Nepal.
So your charity only involves Nepal? 
Yes. Just here.
What about your partners here? 
They have been important to me. Sonam Sherpa, Tsering Lama, Tashi Tenzing, Ang Rita all have been great. I can trust these people wholeheartedly. They know where help is required and through them I can send funds there. I know that the money we’re raising is going to good hands. Corruption is quite high here in Nepal, which is why we need people like them.
How often do you travel around here? 
I travel a lot. How do you think I reach 100? I love to trek around. I’ve been to some really good places. Upper Dolpo, Mustang, Nar Phu… these places aren’t visited by many. I bring friends with me most of the time and we go trekking. This year, we’re going to Langtang.
Do you think tourism has got better here?
I think it has, but there is a lot more we need to do to make sure that Visit Nepal 2020 is a success. They have increased visa fees. They take so much money for permits, but where is the money? People need to ask the government what they’re doing with the money coming in from tourists. It needs to be addressed. The private sector is doing well when it comes to tourism. However, I don’t see the government is doing enough.

25,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/everest-climb-in-autumn-sounds-tough-but-can-be-done-garrett-madison.html,"
Garrett Madison is one of the most sought-after foreign climbers and mountain guides. Since he first summited Everest in 2006, he has led over 60 climbers to the summit of Everest and started his own company, Madison Mountaineering.
Madison holds multiple high-altitude mountaineering world records. He is the only person to have climbed Mount Everest and Lhotse in a day, that too three times. He is also the only American to have climbed K2 twice. Madison spoke to Onlinekhabar about his current expedition where he plans to take a team to the top of Everest in autumn for the first time since 2010 and about mountaineering in Nepal. Excerpts:
How did you go from being a mountain guide to starting your own company? 
I started working as a mountain guide in 1999 when I was 20. It was a summer job to guide people up Mount Rainer. That is how I started. As I loved mountaineering, I joined Alpine Accents International and worked for them until 2014 when I thought why not start my own company. That’s how Madison Mountaineering started. My maiden project was to lead the climb on Everest in 2014 and it’s been a fun but a challenging adventure ever since.
How different was running your own company from working for an expedition company? 
It’s basically the same stuff that I do now. It is just a bit more responsibility on the logistic side. But I have a good team that handles it. So I’d say I’m lucky in that regard.
You recently climbed Everest in the spring season, what made you come back in the autumn? 
I’ve never climbed Everest in autumn. However, I have attempted other 8,000 metre peaks such as Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu in autumn. But I wanted to do Everest too. The main reason is that we’re doing Everest this year because Mountain Hardware, which makes clothing equipment for high altitude climbing wanted to test its new product line. We felt that the best place and time to test it was on Everest in the autumn. We’ll be testing everything from down suits to sleeping bags to tents.
Apart from that, we at Madison Mountaineering wanted to do something unique. As the spring season is overcrowded, we wanted to see if we can market Everest for the autumn. That would help minimise the crowd during the spring. Everest hasn’t been summited in autumn since 2010 and we want to see if we can change that. We have some good climbers on the mountain like Kilian Jornet and Andrzej Bargiel so hopefully, we can work together to reach the top. Our Nepali climbers are just as good and are currently fixing ropes and arranging the base camp so we’re positive about this expedition.
But I am concerned that it’s been raining so much. Rain here means a lot of snow in the mountains and that means there’s a risk of avalanches.
How different do you expect that mountain to be in autumn as compared to spring? 
Well, post-monsoon is different for a variety of reason. Firstly, there’s is a lot of snow up there. Secondly, there are a lot fewer people on the mountain. In spring, there are around a 400-500 people on the mountain, but now there’s going to be around 10-15 max. Autumn is also more winter-like. With winter around the corner days will be shorter and will be windier. The summit weather window will also be shorter. Will be a lot challenging. I’ve done Everest 10 times all in the spring so if we can prove that Everest can be done in the autumn that would be great.
How’s rope fixing going on amidst the rain? 
It’s going on at a slow pace. The weather isn’t good and the Nepali climbers have told me that it’s very cloudy up there. They are one-quarter of the way up the Khumbu icefall. They’re hoping they’ll reach Camp 1 in a week’s time. Our plan is to reach base camp by mid-September and hope by then they’ll be able to reach Camp 2.
Your success rate is quite high. What, according to you, makes a good mountain guide? 
I’d say lots of experience and willingness to learn from mistakes and surrounding yourself with good people. You’ll also need some natural ability and some physical fitness to function well in the death zones. Apart from that we also need proper mountain training and techniques. It’s a combination of knowledge and skill I would say.
Madison on the summit of Everest.
People often say that climbing in Europe and the Americas is different from climbing in the Himalayas. How true is that? 
It’s very true.  In America and the Alps, it’s more like one-day climbs. You start from a mountain hut and climb for one day and your back. You’re just out for a day or maybe half a day. But here you’re up for two weeks. It’s a real expedition here. Have to carry a lot of stuff to be self-sufficient like medical kits, food and a lot more. There is also no quick evacuation. In the Alps, you get a helicopter rescue at any point, but you don’t get that luxury here in the Himalayas.
What do you feel is the toughest part of being a mountaineer?
I guess it’s the sacrifices you have to make. Spending all this time away from family and loved ones isn’t easy. It’s not like a normal job where you leave home and come back in the evening every day. I’m out for two-three months at a time, and spend around 10 months on the road in a year. So I’d that that is the toughest part.
Do clients appreciate your effort when you take them to the top?
They do. I feel happy when they do. But there are times when I cannot fulfil their expectations and they’re not happy. But I try to tell them that their life is much important that the summit. I don’t like risking people’s lives. My first priority is to make sure everyone comes back safe, this includes the Nepali climbers we have on our team.
Do you enjoy climbing mountains? Here the people from Khumbu climb because they don’t have a choice. They say it’s not fun. Do you have fun? 
Yes, I love climbing. This is my passion. When I was a young man and climbed my first mountain I didn’t want to look back. In the US it’s not a lucrative profession, but I didn’t care about it. Because when you do something you love, you don’t feel like its work. I love the challenge too. Made a lot of memories climbing and will continue to do so.
How satisfied do you get when to take clients up to the summit? 
It’s very satisfying as you’ve helped them reach their goal and also helped changed them in a positive way. What I like is how people get new experiences in a foreign land. They tell me they learn a lot about the country as they spend from a few weeks to a few months depending on where they are. They also make friends and take back more than just a climbing certificate.
What do you love the most about the mountains? 
Just being out there in nature with similar-minded people. We share the same passion and enthusiasm. It’s just the best thing.
When we talk about Everest, we have to talk about the traffic jam picture. For someone who was there, how bad was it? 
Well, it wasn’t as bad as the photograph. It was a busy day but it wasn’t the busiest day I’ve seen on Everest. The reason why it looked so crowded was that there were 200 people queuing up to reach the summit. If you have 100 people going up and another 100 people coming down there is sure to be a traffic jam. That’s when the photo was taken. But the media thinks that it is like that all the time which it’s not. It was maybe one hour, one day, in one year. Feel it was blown out of proportion.
Would you blame the traffic jam for all the deaths? 
I don’t think I would. The lives lost in Everest this year could have been saved with good planning and good managing. There are two types of expeditions on Everest. There is a guided expedition like mine where they hire someone like me and my company to manage logistics and in the long run take them to the summit and also make decisions for them.
And then there is the other type of expedition is when a company just manages the climber’s logistics like permits, oxygen, porters and food. But in these expeditions, the climber makes his own decisions.  The company doesn’t tell them to turn around if they can’t climb. That is when people die. Because when you’re up there you can’t think straight. And if you’re not experienced that can cause a lot more problem.
Those that died this year didn’t have experience climbing such a tough mountain.

Will the government’s plan to make it mandatory to climb a mountain in Nepal before attempting Everest prevent these deaths?
I don’t think it’s a bad idea to try to ensure that Everest climbers are more qualified. However, with this rule, if a climber has climbed K2, he/she would still be ineligible to climb Everest which is wrong in my opinion. It doesn’t make sense to me.
How has mountaineering changed in Nepal since you first came here in 2006?
For starters, there are a lot more people in the sport. I feel the sport has grown for several reason. People want to go to these iconic places like the top of Everest. And now that’s it’s possible for more people, the mountain has seen a lot of people since I first climbed in 2006.
Is the rapid growth in Nepali expedition companies the reason why the number of people climbing Everest as risen significantly? 
These new Nepali companies are simply offering a product that has a demand in the market. The climbers want this product. They want to be able to come and climb Everest at a cheaper price. Some people feel they don’t want a guy like me making decisions on their behalf. They want to make their own decisions. The clients are demanding this service and the companies we see now are just fulfilling their demands.
But is that the reason the mountains are getting inexperienced climbers which causes deaths on these 8000 m peaks?
The business model for Nepali companies is different from mine. I make sure that I have experienced climbers on my team and try to keep my team small up to 12 members. The team has high-level support as we have both high-level mountain guides and experienced Nepali high altitude climbers. Along with that we also have top equipment and ample supply of oxygen. I try to offer and run a good program on the mountain.
But the Nepali companies’ model is different. They believe in volume. They offer a similar programme for a much lower cost. Per person, there is a much smaller profit margin, but if you’re able to bring in numbers, you’re definitely going to make money. So their product is volume-based and it’s not a guided trip. The climber makes his/her own decision. The companies provide just logistics and service to climb the mountain, but there’s no one telling them if it’s safe to go up. Well, they have Nepali high altitude climbers but they can’t tell their clients not to go up and it’s dangerous.
The fatalities are that of climbers who don’t have experience and really want to go to the top of a mountain. The people compare prices and always choose a Nepali company as its half cheaper than companies like mine charge. These people don’t have anyone to ask if it’s worth the risk. Most push themselves which makes it tough on their body and collapse.
What makes you different from these other companies?
My risk tolerance is lower than theirs. They tend to think they can do anything, whereas I feel that I can’t. It’s because I am liable for the safety of my clients which is of paramount importance. I need to take that into consideration before making a risky decision. It a fundamental difference of approach. Some of my clients get really irked when people from other expedition agencies summit and we don’t. It happened this year in K2 when we came back because it was not worth the risk. But one client was not happy that we didn’t summit and other teams did. It is hard to explain to people like him that it’s not worth it. But hey, they pay a lot of money so they are right to think that way I guess.

26,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/daraz-ceo-need-to-localise-if-we-want-to-achieve-success-in-nepal.html,"
Bjarke Mikkelsen is the co-CEO of Daraz Group, a popular online shopping company of the region. He has been with the company for the past four years. Prior to joining Daraz, Mikkelsen worked at Goldman Sachs where he worked as its Executive Director for its branch in London.
Mikkelsen spoke to Onlinekhabar about how his company has changed after being acquired by Alibaba and why localising strategies here in Nepal was important for them to grow as a business. Excerpts:
What has changed since Alibaba acquired Daraz?
Three things have changed mainly. First is the technology. Our value proposition to the customer has improved significantly as we are providing a lot more services. For example, we have started the instant messaging service which allows customers and sellers to communicate with one another in a regulated way. It has opened a world of opportunities. The way we display relevant product to relevant customers at the right time is also a huge improvement we’ve made in recent times.
Number two is the supply change. It has increased substantially as now we are working with sellers around the world and also opening up to Nepali sellers to sell to consumers around the world. This is something we’re working on as a big project with Alibaba to integrate all of their different marketplace platforms. We’re also working on a project which will allow a Nepali seller sign up on Daraz and then automatically be eligible to sell to China or anywhere around the world through one single account.
Number three is just learning. So far, we have been figuring out all on our own, but now that we are affiliated with Alibaba we can do things a lot more efficiently because what we are doing here now, they did it in China years ago.
When can people buy items from Alibaba here in Nepal?
You already can, to some extent. We have a global collection in the app through which you can directly order stuff from China.  Slowly, we will be doing more in that aspect.
Why did 11:11 fail in Nepal as compared to other markets?
In general, that was a new concept here in Nepal and we got to learn a lot from it. Alibaba’s 11:11 is the biggest shopping date worldwide and we wanted to try it here too. From a sales perspective, I don’t think it failed. The sales volume was higher than what we expected. But we had these learnings.
We found after the event the certain customers had to wait longer for the items they had ordered. But considering the order volume that we had, we actually enforced a lot after this campaign. We focused a lot on logistics infrastructure.
Since then, we have also been evaluating the performance of every seller. We do not want our customers to suffer. We sit with them and bring out solutions to make them better.
After 11:11, we also launched a campaign in Nepali New Year, and it was good. We have delivered items in a better manner during that campaign than we do on normal days. Be rest assured, 11:11 will be better this year.
How is Alibaba’s model in South Asia different from that of other countries?
I think it’s a lot more localised. What we’re doing now is trying to understand how the local sellers work and what services do they need. Because the services here may be different from, for example, the services they need in China and Malaysia where everything is digitised and integrated.
It is the same principle which is mainly about being engaged and having something for everyone and using technology to manage a huge marketplace with a lot of sellers and a lot of customers.

Is the app also localised?
It is. The algorithm, mainly, is. We look at what people are searching for and what do they want to see and we try to give them that experience. We also try doing local campaigns which aren’t happening in other countries. We did Nepali New Year earlier this year and now we are doing one for Dashain which starts on September 15.
Have you achieved the breakeven? 
No. Not yet. But we will do that. We plan to be a profitable company by 2022. So far we are still investing in the country. We need to build the infrastructure and we need to have the scale.
Kyamu, when it came to Nepal, advertised on Facebook and Google. That has now changed as you have been advertising in the mainstream media. What brought about this change? 
Advertising, in general, has changed since Kyamu was here and we just evolved with it. The manner in which Nepalis interact with media and the internet has also changed. That way we also learned year on year on what was better for our business. As for our advertising strategy, it didn’t change after we rebranded as Daraz or after Alibaba’s acquisition. When we came here with Kyamu, we came in as a startup, but now we are an established business. In general, our strategy is to stay current and relevant which is why we have been working with more influencers than before.
What inspired Daraz University? How have sellers here taken to it?
It was inspired by Taobao University in China started by Alibaba. When we first started working with Alibaba who had a gigantic university in China we wanted to do something similar to give sellers the knowhow to sell. That was the inspiration. After that, we sat down with a blank piece of paper and started to design a curriculum and we started to do it. That way anyone who has a smartphone can start his/her business.",/interview,"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 08:36:34 +0000"

After reports of a ‘mass suicide’ by monkeys in Chautara of Sindhupalchok district came out, zoologist Dr Mukesh Chalise’s phone was abuzz the entire week. Chalise, the most quoted ‘monkey expert’ in Nepali media, retired from the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University last month. Onlinekhabar recently caught up with Chalise, whose PhD research decades ago focused on the food habits of male and female monkeys.
Excerpts:
Let’s begin the conversation about the ‘mass suicide’ case. You told the media that animals don’t commit suicide or any other crime intentionally. What grounds do you have to support your thesis?
In the course of evolution, the primitive species developed the simplest of nervous systems, which would enable them to feel heat and cold; light and dark. Gradually, other organ systems developed and later specific parts such as nose, ears, and eyes came into being. Then, after thousands of years, mammals came into existence. Humans are mammals whose nervous system has achieved the highest level of development among all the species, and far high enough than lower species.
If you love someone, you can sacrifice your property for them. You can donate the blood flowing inside your body; you can even donate your own organ so that another person can lead a better life. Human beings don’t only have the highest level of benevolence, but also the highest level of selfishness. We can commit heinous crimes such as rape and murder. Suicides are also a result of the highest depression resulted by the influence of genetic characters, religious, social and political situation that impact on human instinct.
Though monkeys are also mammals, they cannot develop such desires because their brain is not fully developed for that. They can make efforts to save themselves and their partners, but they cannot think of killing themselves intentionally. Many animals die falling off cliffs while running to protect themselves from predators, but it should not mean that they commit suicide in fear of predators.
Many people in the Tarai report to me that they have seen many langurs falling off the trees to kill themselves after seeing carnivores, but it is not true. What happens in such cases is that the langurs lose balance after seeing predators and accidentally fall down.
Monkeys have a peculiar interest in investigating things around them, but humans misinterpret it as ‘mischief’. When they find new things, they check if they can eat it; when they go to any new place, they check if they can play there. In 1996, a monkey in Pashupatinath area of Kathmandu touched an unshielded wire; it received an electric shock and cried–without detaching itself from the wire. Another monkey heard the cry and came to save it; it also cried for help. In this way, a total of 41 monkeys died in their efforts to save one monkey. This cannot be considered a mass suicide case because they wanted to save their friend, but that does not mean they wanted to kill themselves.
Like other human societies, Nepali society is also living with animals for ages. But why doesn’t it understand basic things about animals and misinterpret cases like these? Wasn’t it the responsibility of academic institutions like university departments, such as the one you worked for over three decades?
In order to understand why we failed, we need to understand how our education system was developed. If you analyse the historical development of schools in Nepal, you see that our education system always concentrates on meeting the needs of the bureaucracy; this is reflected in both what is taught and how it is taught. It was not concerned with producing experts of certain disciplines or connecting sciences with society. Before the ‘new education system’ (Naya Shiksha) was implemented in the early 1970s, we were required to study ‘civic education’ (Nagarikshastra) and ‘bylaws’ (Ainshastra) in school. They were compulsory subjects, but maths and science were not. We had to learn how to prepare a ‘tamasuk’ (an agreement to facilitate local loan transactions) and how to fold a paper to write a tamasuk.

At the higher level also, the study of science began only in 1959 with the establishment of the Tribhuvan University. Among various disciplines of natural science, many people were attracted to physics because it was comparatively easier and it would not require the students to go beyond the campus. Subjects like zoology came much later, in 1965, because they were more difficult and required practical insights. In the beginning, professors from other countries would visit Tri-Chandra College to teach us. Our university [Tribhuvan University] did not conduct exams on such subjects. If you check the certificates of science professors of that time, you can find they acquired the degrees from foreign institutions including the Patna University of India. Overall, the education system focused on meeting immediate needs, it did not help address practical concerns of common people and uplift the country in the world of sciences.
So, how long did the problem exist? It must have been solved by now. 
No, even our academic programmes just copied courses from Patna University. Even after I joined the university, I remember, we had to struggle to include material related to Nepal’s flora and fauna in the curricula. Intentionally or unintentionally, the professors copied from others, without considering the dignity of their own country.
So far, only around a dozen have completed their PhD in zoology from the Tribhuvan University. I did my PhD in 1995; I was the seventh Nepali zoologist to obtain a PhD and the first in my generation to do so. In the past 24 years since then, only eight persons have done their PhD in this field from the TU. Some went to foreign universities.
Exactly! The number of science students at the high school level has significantly increased. But most of them study medical science or engineering. No one is willing to take up zoology or botany.
Many students, who studied zoology at the master’s level, did not continue their study in the field, but joined the civil service. Former chief secretary Bimal Koirala; and former secretaries Bal Krishna Prasain, Madhu Raman Acharya, BHoj Raj Ghimire, Sushil Ghimire and Mahashram Sharma studied zoology. But they left the discipline after realising that the civil service did not have any position for zoologists. The Public Service Commission calls applications for various positions that require people who have studied accounts, statistics, forestry, geology, or medical science, but not zoology.
Even the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation did not accept us. From its inception, it decided to recruit people who have studied forestry. They though zoologists know about animals, not about the forest. All high position holders of the department are students of forestry. They continued to ignore zoologists.
The zoology department of Tribhuvan University has so far produced around 1,000 zoologists; around 100 have completed their PhD from foreign universities. But still, the Public Service Commission does not recognise the discipline.
Of late, some national and international nongovernment organisations have begun looking for zoologists. Our students have achieved remarkable scientific results in exploration, the discovery of species and impact assessments for developmental projects.
Maybe the commission thought the discipline did not have any importance at the government departments. After all, they are functioning okay even without the zoologists.
No. Zoology is one of the most important scientific disciplines for Nepal. We still proudly claim that we are an agricultural country. Animal rearing is a major branch of Nepali agriculture system, and this is where the farmers can use zoological knowledge. Zoology gives you information about habits and behaviours, life cycles, food systems, reproduction systems and habitats of animals and birds. It means if farmers begin their businesses with the knowledge of zoology, they can reap additional benefits.
If you talk about agriculture-based industries, zoology is equally important. For example, you want to open a modern slaughterhouse. You need zoological knowledge there because veterinarian knowledge is not enough.
Zoology is important for the social sciences as well. You may know that Germans developed the kindergarten system in education after noticing that animals that were separated from their parents early could not socialise well. You can also take the Sindhupalchok case as an example here. After the incident of the deaths of monkeys, locals now need to take additional safety measures to protect their children from drowning. Studying animals has always helped the human society.
If you talk about medical science, if you can extract venom from poisonous snakes like cobra, you can use that to produce anti-venom medicines and save thousands of lives. You might know that the vaccines that are applied to human beings were first tested on animals…

Yes. But, rights activists have always protested the act of using animals to test medicines. Do you think that is ethical?
So do you want to kill human beings in order to save animals? Without causing significant loss to their number, we need to use a few animals to save humanity. Do you wish for the continuous increase in the number of leopards around Kathmandu at the cost of lives of people living there? Or do you think that is ethical?
I am clear that we need to kill animals if they cause harm to humans or other beings. As a human being, I don’t want the destruction of the human race just to increase the number of other species. I continue giving the medicines tested on monkeys to my aged parents who are suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes. If you love monkeys more than your parents, you can abstain from using the medicines. If you want your mother to die in the pain of uterine cancer because you don’t want to carry out a surgery that is tested on an animal first, that is fine. Do you know that cataract surgery started by testing it on monkeys? But if you don’t like it, fine. I don’t argue with you.
But if we develop zoological studies in Nepal, the country can earn millions of dollars every year by selling the medicines. If the country wants to capitalise on its biodiversity, zoological knowledge should be used in medical science. For example, China earns money from every panda of a particular species that is born in any part of the world because the species is originally available in China only. Similarly, macaques (known as red monkeys) that are available in Nepal are ‘purer’ than those in India or China; hence we can experiment medicines of AIDs and tuberculosis on them, and earn millions of rupees in revenues. We should move towards that model. In the name of rights, we should not promote wrong concepts and practices that avoid the value of natural resources. We also should be aware that such experiments affect only very few animals.
Fine, perhaps we can discuss the ethical concerns in another meeting. Now, I want to conclude the conversation on a positive note. Tell us something from the field that is improving.
The zoological study in Nepal has shifted from the traditional approach to the application-centric approach. TU has developed different courses for four branches of zoology; namely: fishery, entomology, parasitology, and ecology. Recently, our students have worked for hydropower projects, urban planning and forest monitoring. Our parasitologists have emerged as professors of medical science. The discipline’s scope has expanded.
Does it mean that Mukesh Chalise will not be the single source for media to talk about any zoological issue now onwards?
Haha… You need to know why I was called and quoted every time. Thanks to my family’s encouragement, I began exploring new places and study about animals living there from my youth. Before Makalu Barun was named a national park, I visited that place and carried out the research. When I submitted my proposal about monkeys to the university for my PhD, many people laughed at me. They said I could have received huge foreign grants if I had chosen elephants, tigers or rhinoceros. I said I did not need money, but knowledge.
Many things are yet to be improved in the discipline in Nepal. The discipline has to be made more practical and connected to daily life. For example, institutes of eastern Nepal should teach their students about parasites and insects affecting the tea cultivation; colleges of western Nepal should teach them about tigers and elephants. They should know why Indian elephants cross the big Mahakali and come to Nepal. The students of the Koshi region need to learn why wild water buffaloes are found in that region of the country only while similar river systems exist in Karnali, Rapti and Narayani regions as well. The students should be taught about pesticides that are applied to vegetables of this region. If that had been the case, our students would have tested pesticide residue on the vegetables imported from India even if the government did not care about it.
This is a global practice and we should follow that. We should thoroughly overhaul the university curricula. Otherwise, the degree you have earned only serves as your prestige label.",/interview,"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 04:18:00 +0000"

With the controversy over a Public Service Commission notice calling applications for 9,000 plus vacancies at the local level, Nepali political leaders and commentators are once again debating the relevance of reservation allocated to various social groups. Along with that, many issues about rights of the disadvantaged groups have come to the fore again.
Dalits, or ‘the untouchables’, constitute a significant section of the disadvantaged populations in Nepal. While many stakeholders associate this problem with Hinduism, Harvard scholar Suraj Yengde from India argues it is a global problem. Yendge claims he has understood multiple dimensions of the issue as he spent a miserable childhood in a Dalit settlement in Maharashtra before he got a scholarship to study at prestigious international institutions like Harvard Kennedy School.
Yengde was recently in Nepal to discuss his new book ‘Caste Matters’. He talked to Onlinekhabar over his growth into a global Dalit scholar and his thesis that an independent global Dalit movement is needed to solve the global issue.
Excerpts:
How did you rise from an underprivileged young boy to an international scholar?
My story reflects the story of most of the Dalits in India and South Asia. Different people came into my life in different life. The most important person in my life was my father, who was a peon at a private bank. As an elder child, he had to take many responsibilities. But, he was really devoted to the social movement of Dalits. He was associated with various organisations. He was educated up to the ninth grade only, but he was learned beyond educational qualifications. He was an activist who was interested in empowering his community.
As a Dalit, the only option you have, except doing your traditional occupation, is education. If you don’t pursue education, you go back to your caste-centered traditional job such as cleaning bathrooms and toilets, doing manual labour.
We belong to a caste called Mahars, we were traditional village servants, not limited to one specific job, but doing all kinds of menial jobs like cleaning the carcass of dead animals. But Mahars were also like militants; they fought against the Brahmins.
Hence, my father decided to educate me because I could have ended up like every other member of my community doing menial jobs. Or I could have turned into a criminal like a pickpocket if not educated.
But how did you pursue your education despite your miserable economic condition?
I grew up below the poverty line. Five members of our family lived in one small room. But, my father wanted to educate his children in an English medium school. All his colleagues did not take it well. They said to him, “You are just a bank peon. The school fee is more than your salary. How can you afford it?” Paradoxically, the manager of my father’s bank had also enrolled his son in the same school. He was my classmate.
Every week, we had a sports hour at school. I did not have additional shoes, so would wear my school shoes for football and other sports. I only had two socks, and they had to be washed again. The same with clothes; it rained the next morning you washed them, you would have to go to the school in wet clothes. Further, if you did not wear your school uniforms, they would ask you to go back home.
But I liked my school because home was not the place that I wanted to live. There was sewage running outside, and it smelled foul every day. Women would be fighting. There used to be filthy abuses. People were literally beating each other. The school was an escape from every such trauma.
So how did your father pay your tuition fees which were higher than his salary?
My education was also supported by my uncles, paternal as well as maternal uncles. My mother would frequently go to sit with her brother and ask him to support me. Because the brother-sister bond is deep in our culture, he would support me. Also, we borrowed money. My mother had one mangalsutra that she always put in pawn to take loans for me.
But still, I could not participate in recreations and other activities in the school. It was a kind of limited education. I used to feel ashamed of my status. I used to lie to my friends about my dad’s profession because they were people of high castes. I used to tell them that he was a bank clerk. In fact, he was a servant to their parents and I didn’t want my schoolmates to know that.
Till when did you remain ashamed of your identity? When did you gather the courage to feel that you had to talk about it?
I got a scholarship to study abroad and went to England for a master’s in law. My specialisation was human rights law. While doing research, I saw that the problem of untouchability was across the continents, in Africa, in Europe, in South Asia, in North and Latin Americas. But, I realised the research has not been done; and hence I had thought the problem I was grappling with was my personal problem, but a structural one.
It was in 2011 only. Since then, I felt good because I was not alone.

Besides that it was a global problem, what were other highlights of your learning and recommendations to cope with them?
We have rejected the humanity of the Dalit population. We have not given them a desired equal respect.
To solve it, the Dalit voice needs to be prioritised. The Dalit women, doubly or triply oppressed, need to be brought to the front. We have to look in a mirror that we have never seen ourselves in. It is important if we want to go to the next level of human achievement. As long as caste system remains there, we cannot go beyond the medieval-era society; we cannot become modern. Even though we have fashionable clothes, our minds will be still rooted in the medieval era thinking.
So far, the cosmetic change has happened, but not the structural one. For that to happen, we have to move away from the medieval-era thinking. If we carry that, our modernity will hit a wall, it will not progress.
Right now, we need an autonomous Dalit identity movement which also makes other caste groups feel that they also need to be a part of it.
Can you please go back and explain what did you mean by the medieval-era thinking and what is the thinking that you want to replace it with?
Nepal still practises untouchability. It was created in the past to make sure that one group has supremacy over another, to make sure that the people working in the farms and fields remained there for generations. The caste system gives it a sanction. In the South Asian society governed by the Hindu ideology, the caste system becomes a religious authority.
If you want to think about the medieval era thinking, think about how many Dalit priests are there in temples of Nepal. How many Dalit politicians are there in Parliament? How many Dalit bureaucrats are there in policy-making positions? How many Dalit independent media enterprises do exist? More importantly, how many Dalits are valued for what they are beyond their caste? You get very negative answers to these questions.
You mean to say the caste system is a problem of the Hindu society. 
What I am advocating right now is the caste problem is a global problem. The term itself is a Portuguese term, meaning ‘division’. If you go to any society, there are structural divisions historically. Muslims, Buddhists, and people believing in every other religion that trusts in the idea of supremacy practice caste. Supremacy exists in Europe also, for example, white supremacy. For me, there is a global Dalit and there is a global Brahmin.
But, there are similarities and differences between these practices. The first similarity is the historic form of oppression continues. The second, it is based on one’s birth; whichever family you are born to defines your lifetime. The third is, it’s structural; structures have been brought in. Fourth, it is personal, people practice caste discrimination based on their personal understanding. Fifth, the system is retained in various cultural forms. Then of course, economically and politically, they are at the bottom. The struggle for economic rights has to be a part of Dalit movements…

Exactly! Many sociologist scholars and the public believe that caste is an outdated issue and it doesn’t have any effect anymore. What matters more is your control over socioeconomic resources, decided by your class.
This is a very farcical argument. It is trying to dissuade and befool the public. Every society that is economically divided has other structures that make the divisions possible. The divisions are not only results of different amounts of control over the capital; the division thrived because the caste system already existed.
If the caste system is outdated, why do the Brahmins still continue to retain their control over the spiritual wealth? Why do they still have a monopoly over the temples? Those who believe that the caste system is outdated have to give up the privileges they had because of their caste.
The caste system is very much intact and it needs to be seriously handled.
But how can you claim that Brahmins and other people have caste privileges? They too have to do a lot of struggles if they don’t have control over socioeconomic resources. Instead, Dalits have privileges in the form of reservation.
In a caste-based society, if you are a Brahmin, you are already 10 steps ahead. Your network is already set up. The very element of being a Brahmin carries a certain privilege. You are not brought up with the ideology of being inferior. You are always taught to rule and command. You are taught to walk in confidence. It’s such an enormous privilege that nobody can take away from you.
Imagine some Dalits living in your community, whose parents are living as servants at other people’s houses or cleaning the sewage of their community. What are these parents going to teach their children? What is the future they will offer to them? They don’t have a vision because they are not taught how to think. More importantly, they don’t have idols–whom they are looking up to where the father is a drunkard and there are altercations with other people in the community?
Caste system takes away confidence from every Dalit person. Compare that with being a Brahmin, who has a monopoly over education for thousands and thousands of years.
So you still believe that a reservation based on caste categories in public service and other sectors is still relevant?
The reservation system is meant to uplift the communities who are not at a similar level. It is an opportunity for all of us to make sure that people who never had access to the resources can come with us. Through reservations, we have a golden opportunity to meet fellow people to come onto a similar plain and have camaraderie.
But now, some people are fighting against the reservation or affirmative actions. These are people who lack confidence, who don’t have merits. If you have merit, come what may, you will still survive. Why are you getting insecure about the people who have come to school for the first time? If you have merit, you should be able to compete with the people of any quality, any talent, and any background.
The reservation system should be more radical. It should go beyond giving seats. It should create more positive discriminations. We should make sure that the system supports the persons belonging to the lower caste to go to the top.
But focusing on the reservation, we are missing a lot. Reservation and other progressive measures should go together. We need more than a reservation.

Should the reservation system continue indefinitely or do we need to set a time limit?
Time limit is subjective. We can say, “Tomorrow, we will finish untouchability.” If we finish it tomorrow, no reservation is needed. But, it’s only imaginative thought. It is just an attempt to befool everyone.
Let’s say, the caste system is a train passing through a village. Its speed is so high that many people are missing out. Reservation provides the people with a mechanism to catch up on the train. But that does not take you to the final destination. Reservation and redistribution of resources have to go side by side. We will need at least 10 to 15 measures like the reservation for us to reach the common goal.
Ending reservation is not a solution. If you want to have equality, there should be a proportional representation of every caste group. Say, if there are 12-13 per cent Brahmins, give them 12-13 per cent reservation. Let their communities get represented proportionally.
Otherwise, it will only end at the moment when you stop treating other Dalit persons as sub-humans, as others not belonging to our group. Don’t worry about ending the reservation. The moment equality will be established, the Dalits themselves will get rid of it.

Ang Tshering Sherpa was born in Khumjung Solu Khumbu, to a yak trader and mountain man who befriended Edmund Hillary. Sherpa received his education at a school set up by Hillary. He was involved in mountain various expeditions, helping his father assist climbers. In 1982, he bought a trekking company called Asian Trekking, which grew into a trusted name in the business. Sherpa, who also served as the chair of Nepal Mountaineering Association, is also the President of Climate Alliance of Himalayan Communities (CAHC) and Honorary Consul of Belgium to Nepal. Onlinekhabar’s Shashwat Pant recently talked to Sherpa about mountaineering on Everest and issues that have come to the fore during the climbing season this spring. Translated excerpts:
Let’s begin by talking about the yesterday of mountain climbing in Nepal. How was it different from what it is now?
Until the 1990s, we had a system called the ‘one-team-one route’ system under which only one expedition would be allowed to climb a mountain using one route. But after the restoration of democracy, the government started issuing permits to multiple groups for the same route. There are many routes to mountains such as Everest, but most of them are difficult. There’s one route via the South Col which everyone wants to take.
Similarly, the climbing equipment used to be heavy and bulky. A lot of improvements have been made in the last few years to make thing s more comfortable. There was a time when Sherpas did not have the skills nor the training to climb mountains. We didn’t get weather reports the way we do now. We had to rely on brute force.
In 1963, when the first American expedition came to Nepal, their communication equipment had to be carried by seven porters. But now communications equipment have changed and become smaller. An average bottle of oxygen would weigh around 7-8 kgs. But now it is hardly 3kg.
If you talk about the climbers, things have changed there as well. In the past, we used to have expeditions from specific countries–the government in those countries would sponsor such expeditions. The team members would climb another mountain together before coming to Everest to improve their coordination. But now we have mixed teams whose members do not know each other until they reach base camp.
How important is mountaineering for Nepal’s tourism?
Mountaineering provides employment to so many people and brings money to Nepal. It is also one of the biggest means to promote Nepal. Whenever someone decides to climb Everest, the person talks to the local media about his/her plans. When they come here, they send constant updates saying they have reached base camp, they have set foot on Camp II and so on. Journalists also come to Nepal to cover the expeditions. Their family members friends and sponsors are also interested in what goes on. When someone is done summiting Everest, he/she writes a book, prepares a documentary or presents his/her story before large gatherings. We’ve seen that expedition members have made effective promotion of Nepal.
Over the years, various issues have propped up in the mountaineering business in Nepal. The first of these problems is that Everest is becoming dirty.
The first thing I want to say is that because of climate change, snow is melting and waste that was buried in snow is propping out. The other thing is that in 1993, a photo in an international magazine showed that Everest was becoming a garbage dump. The photo brought a lot of criticism, but it also raised our awareness about the issue.
In 1996, we conducted a clean-up campaign and started a scheme under which we provide cash for waste. The government also introduced a system under which climbers have to deposit a certain amount as a waste deposit. There is an anecdote I want to share. I remember a Russian team making its way to the base camp huffing and puffing and carrying loads of garbage on their back. They were thinking that Nepali officials would come to inspect their waste. But no one came. This shows that we need good monitoring to back up rules to keep the mountain clean.
Do you think mountaineering in Nepal, received a lot of bad press this year especially because of the infamous ‘traffic jam’?
I think we could have easily managed the traffic jam. The representatives of the mountaineering operators’ association tried to coordinate the expeditions, but the operators did not coordinate with them. This year, we had a climbing window from May 21-25. While 60 people made their way to the top on the 21st, 300 attempted to climb the mountain on the 22nd. But on the 24th only 15-16 people attempted, and by 25th everyone had left. If the expeditions had coordinated, then 100 people could have attempted on 22nd, or 50 people on the 23d and so on. They would not have had to stand in line for a long time. The three-hour-long jam tarnished Nepal’s image; as climbers spent time on the line, they got altitude sickness, some of them suffered from frost bites.
Do you think any of the nine deaths this year could be attributed to the traffic jam?
No, one died of the traffic jam this year. What happened was that some of the climbers spent all their energy going up, and they did not have it in them to come down.
The other important issue we face is that of human waste. During the climbing season, which lasts for around one-and-a-half months, we have 700-800 people on a mountain where we don’t have toilets. This is a problem with all popular mountains. For that reason, we came up with the idea of Everest Eco Expedition in 2008. Under the expedition, we bring special bags made in America to dispose of human waste. The bag has special enzymes that decompose human waste. The bag itself is also biodegradable–it degrades in around three years. We bring the human waste to Gorakhshep and bury it in pits. Even if we fail to bring the bags to base camp, it will decompose in three years. I think that all mountaineering companies should use these kinds of bags, the government should also make it mandatory for them to use it.
 

Following reports of deaths on Everest and the government’s decision to issue a record number of permits this year, there have been calls to reform the way permits are issued. Some are saying that the government should make it mandatory for anyone who wishes to climb Everest to at least climb a 6,000m-odd mountain to prove that they are worthy of climbing the highest mountain in the world. It this something new?
Yes, we suggested to the government to implement a rule that would make it mandatory for anyone who wishes to climb Everest to first climb a 7,000m peak. We did that for two reasons, first the climbers themselves would be more confident and second, the human resources we have could be utilised better. But we could not implement the decision as foreign climbers said that mountains in Europe which are only a few thousand metres tall are more difficult to climb than the 7,000m mountains in Nepal. Some diplomats based in Kathmandu were also against the idea so it could not be implemented.
The other issue that comes up regularly is about the local people of the Everest region. While there are people who are benefiting from tourism, there are others who are not involved in the tourism business. How are those people benefiting from tourism giving back to the people who are not?
I understand that the situation is not easy for them. Daily commodities have become expensive because of tourism. There are monks and nuns, along with the elderly, who do not have anything to do with tourism. There are also those people who do not live on popular tourist routes. I think it is the social responsibility of mountaineering operators to help them sustain. When we had a helicopter company, we would ferry essentials such as grains, tea and sugar for these people. But now, they have become more prosperous. Now we are thinking of new ways to help them.
In one of the regions, where we work, the local community chopped down a forest in one year. I asked them if they knew how much time it takes for a forest to grow. They said, “400-500 years.” When I asked them why they’d cut the trees if they knew what went into growing the forest, they said that they cannot keep their families hungry to conserve the forest. Which is why we are starting an awareness campaign to make these people aware of the importance of trees and also the impact of global warming on the mountains.
To wrap up, do you have any vision of how the mountaineering business in Nepal should move forward?
I think the most important thing is to build a system. I would like to share an example. When I went to Europe to climb Mt Blanc, we saw that around 50,000 people come to the base of the mountain– something like our Namche– every year. But when we climbed the mountain, there were around 100 people ahead of us and another 150 behind us. I’d imagined that only around 16,000-17,000 people would climb the mountain every year, but my son told me that more than 21,000 people climb the mountain every year and it was not dirty. They have a strict monitoring mechanism in place. Sagarmatha is 4-5 times bigger than Mt Blanc, we can easily manage it with the right system.
What about the liaison officers? Are they not doing the monitoring?
We say that instead of deploying government officers as liaison officers, the government should deploy climbers to monitor activities on the mountain. The liaison officers cause problems only, even when they are not at base camp. When they do come to base camp–like the 4-5 of the 47 officers this year– they demand chicken and mutton every day and hot water to go the toilet in a place where boiling water is very difficult. There are officers who stay in Namche and play cards the whole day. If they lose, they make the operators pay. Some officers even don’t care to leave Kathmandu. They make arrangements with the airlines to produce fake tickets and hotels in Namche to produce fake bills.",/interview,"Tue, 02 Jul 2019 04:51:54 +0000"

It is quite unusual for villagers of remote Bajura district as they see 18 people from diverse backgrounds, from youth to senior citizens, busy collecting the field data using the GPS (global positioning system) and smartphones.
But recently, the locals of Budhiganga municipality of the district got trained recently to digitally map their resources, landmarks and upload them on the global open platforms called OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap is a global initiative to create a complete map contributed by the volunteers which are freely available for everyone to use in the future.
“We wish to create a task force who are readily available to map their own area whenever needed, we are confident that this will contribute to addressing the data gaps and will be crucial in the context of new federal structure,” says Uttam Pudasaini, a leader of the team who trained locals in Bajhang and Bajura districts.
Confident locals
Participants showed great enthusiasm to map their areas as the results were visible instantly online. The experts’ team had remotely mapped whole areas of Bajhang and Bajura beforehand. Some information from the remote map about two municipalities was validated by the participants who collected the field-based data. A total of 41 locals from the two districts participated in the training and made contributions to the validation.

Mira Kumari Joshi, an information technology officer in Khaptad Chhededaha rural municipality, was one of these participants. She says, “We face many difficulties due to unavailability of the digital information about our region and now we are confident that we will be able to map our own area and use this to fulfil our own needs.”
Likewise, Khadak Singh Bista, a local school principal, says, “These kinds of technical skills need to be transferred to the local communities, which could greatly contribute to supporting local level developmental efforts”.
Support for development planning
With the new federal structure in place, the local units seem to be suffering from data deficiency and they have to start it over from level zero. Most of the municipalities are still in the process of producing their municipality profile. Most importantly, if someone wishes to visit the municipality and ward offices from outside, their location is not available online. The only way is to ask local people about the location and rely on them, which sometimes might not be accurate.

During the fieldwork in Bajhang and Bajura, this team found out that even the government authorities like ward offices were not digitally mapped and it was very difficult to find the location for outsiders and even for the community people.
Hence, Deepak Shah, mayor of the Budhiganga municipality, states, “These kinds of information are important in making the development plans and also tracking the road development in the area”.
Information for resilience
Bajura is considered to be one of the most disaster-prone districts of the country. It is impacted by a diverse range of disasters. The situation is exacerbated by the impacts of global environmental changes. In this context, location-based information can play an important role during emergencies in this age of technology.

In cases of humanitarian emergencies, this information will be crucial as the information about key services including health posts, financial services, first aid, and the security forces are available online, for free. Also, if any humanitarian actors wish to use this information for planning any activities, these data can be very helpful.  The community-mapped open spaces can also be used for evacuation, safe shelters and spots for landing helicopters during emergency situations.
On September 16, 2019, the Sanphe-Martadi road section at Balde of Budhiganga municipality in Bajura was blocked due to a massive landslide. There were many other active landslides in the districts, not mapped and located. With this mapping effort, some of the major landslides have been mapped and are available online. Most importantly, local people have been empowered to fill the data gap in the future.",/lifestyle,"Thu, 05 Dec 2019 04:44:47 +0000"
31,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/sarauto-movie-review-story-speaks-louder-than-action.html,"
What is a ‘sarauto’ anyway? Arguably, many Nepali cinemagoers of the young generation are not familiar with the term. Making a movie with such a difficult word in the title and featuring a non-star cast is really a risky affair. However, the producers dared to do it and the movie is already on the screen now.
This week’s Kollywood release might exceed your expectations you may have set considering its strange title. Even with the non-star team, debutant director Hari Humagain has done an impressive job.
Raghav Krishna Gautam’s intriguing story and dialogues compensate for the so-so acting and overall presentation of the movie. Despite several flaws, the movie keeps most members of the audience hooked, and it deserves applause as the majority of contemporary Nepali ‘action’ films are boring and unsubstantial.
Action with love story and family drama    
First, be clear that Sarauto is not only an action movie; it is also an emotional love story and a family drama. This is the first reason why this movie can offer you something more than what you have expected.
Nepali action movies have not received good reviews in the past. They are found to be imitating Bollywood action patterns, but failing to meet the standard. Sarauto might not be any exception.
However, the action is not the only thing that you can look forward to in this movie. It also has a beautiful, though tragic, love story, and heightened family conflict. These elements enable the movie to appeal to different groups of the audience, for different reasons.

Sarauto’s love story is unique. The way that the heroine (Sumi Moktan) and the hero (Sunny Singh) meet is quite common, but the way they develop their intimacy is arguably peculiar. (Further description of this ‘way’ could be a spoiler!) Like other love story movies, this film also includes a couple of songs. However, the songs essentially do not contribute anything to the overall impact of the movie.
The movie also offers you an emotionally-charged family drama. This is not as beautiful as the love story, because it has a bias. The movie reinforces a prejudiced idea about adopted children of the family (again, a further description of this argument should not be revealed here). But, notwithstanding the bias, the drama is worth watching.
This film obviously includes other regular components of an action movie: revenge, betrayal, fight, and bloodsheds. If you love foreign action movies and want to see how Nepali filmmakers are also learning tricks of the genre, go watch it and judge on your own.
Cinematic presentation
Because the movie’s director is an experienced cinematographer, the movie’s visual language clearly communicates its message. As the plot moves between the past and the present, several flashback scenes are included in the movie. The chronological (present) and flashback (past) scenes have been effectively connected into a sequence hence there is not much confusion.
Nevertheless, a few incidents from the past–for example, the heroine’s conversation with her dad about ‘the greatest thing in life’–are repeated many times, and it might force the audience to lose their interest. Likewise, some flashback scenes, for example Jeetjung (Leo Tank) narrating his past and his transformation into a villain, are too quick.

Moreover, the first half of the movie baffles you. You see three parallel storylines. All of them merge into the one some minutes before the intermission. Because you can easily understand the development of events since then, the plot can become more interesting.
The writer and the director have tried to make some scenes symbolic, but they do not work much effectively. In the movie’s trailer, you can see the hero expressing a metaphor of rivers and bridges about human separations and connections. This does not appeal much as it is already used too much.
The biggest symbols used in the movie are the ‘sarauto’ an ‘Om’-sign locket. The sarauto symbolism is quite clear, neither is it problematic for the tool is associated with the antagonist forces. But there is a big problem with the Om locket. Because the sign is a common symbol of Hinduism, the movie using it to refer to the villain is offensive and insensitive to the biggest religious group of the country.
Acting
As the lead, Sumi Moktan has done a nice job. Her acting is not perfect, but she has left an impression and shown the potential of further development in the field. Her male counterpart, Sunny Singh is also commendable. He is cool, gentle and handsome as demanded by his role. He has been seen natural all the time, even when he acts drinking, and it is his biggest strength. Parakram PJB Rana as the hero’s confidant has also proved his capacity in acting. In his debuting project, Leo Tank (Tanka Dhamala) has also made since efforts to act alive though at times his acting looks immature and artificial. He, of course, has space for improvement, but he must have caught other directors’ eye for a villain’s role in the future. Sampada Dahal cannot shine much.

Among the artists playing supporting roles, Aruna Karki and Vijaya Lama’s performance is memorable. However, it is not only because of their long experiences, but also due to the positive roles they are given. Dhiren Shakya and Yubaraj Lama are average.
Verdict
Though promoted as an action movie, Sarauto’s story is more appealing than the action. It deserves your two hours and a quarter, plus a ticket of a few hundred rupees.

32,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/why-everyone-needs-to-worry-about-first-case-of-malaria-parasites-in-nepali-buffalos.html,"File: A buffalo farm in Nepal
Nepali zoologists have reported the first case of the malaria parasite in water buffalos in Nepal. The alarming discovery places thousands of farmers who rear buffalos and their cattle across the country at risk.
Scientists, who uncovered the presence of the hitherto unnoticed parasites, say besides farmers, the non-farming urban group is also at risk, almost equally. Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation’s Deputy Director-General Ram Chandra Kandel, who led the research in 2017, informs that buffalo meat-eaters in the urban areas constitute the most vulnerable group in Nepal. “Multiple studies have found out that eating meat from diseased animals can cause various ailments.”
The finding
Interestingly, the study was not carried out as an independent research project. It was a by-product of Kandel’s PhD research. “My primary concern, for the PhD, was threats to wild water buffalos in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve caused by the assimilation of domestic buffalos with the wild buffalos,” he says, “In the process; I wanted to see major diseases troubling them.”
To find out the presence of diseases in the animal, Kandel mobilised a team of other scientists to conduct the study, who hinted that the animals could be suffering from malaria.
The team collected blood samples from 56 water buffalos including 16 wild, 23 feral and 17 domestic. Of 16 wild buffalos, 13 were from the wildlife reserve whereas three were captives of the central zoo of Nepal. The domestic and feral buffalos were taken from human settlements outside the wildlife reserve. In total, three were 32 female and 24 male buffalos. Whereas the team could not identify the age of 18 buffalos, the other 38 were 15-day to 15-year-old.
During the study, one feral and one domestic buffalo were found to be contaminated with malaria parasites. “This is just four percent of our sample size, but given the implications and the lack of measures to control further expansion, it is a serious threat,” claims Kandel.
The risk
Citing similar studies for other diseases in other countries, he further added that the impacts of such meat on human health can pass onto the next generations also. “It seems one mouthful of a ‘buff’ momo that you eat can hit many generations.” He says many people cannot properly identify the causes of their diseases these days, but they fail to notice such petty issues such as where the momo meat comes from.”
File: Momo
Though Kandel says he does not have any specific examples about a malaria-infected buffalo meat causing health risks to humans, he seems convinced given the level of ‘carelessness’ of Nepali people about such issues.
“There are reports of bird flu almost every year in Nepal, but many people do not seem to be bothered about it anyway. The price pf chicken drops as household consumers choose not to eat chicken after such reports,” he says, “But you go to the restaurants in your neighbourhood and you find that chicken momos are equally popular notwithstanding the infection.”
Farmers’ fears
Malaria is apparently a non-communicable disease; there is no way that the cattle can spread it to farmers directly. However, the discovery of malaria in buffalos is a hint that the atmosphere that farmers are living in is prone to the infection and it affects the humans equally, according to the researcher.
Most farmers of Nepal keep their cattle close-by. In many cases, the cowsheds are within the same house that the farmers live in, which is not a problem. “But, you know how the farmers rear the animals?” Kandel explains, “The cowsheds are dirty. The manure is not removed on time. Ultimately, the places of cattle turn out to be hubs for the mosquitoes, the vectors of malaria.”
“The farmers do not care about their own health. How can we expect them to care about the animals and keep the place clean?” he questions before saying, “But, we need to realise that the risks for the animals are also the risks for people.”
On the other hand, malaria kills the cattle untimely or weakens them physically. It causes a huge economic loss to the farmers.

Remedies
The researcher suggests that different measures can be adopted at different levels to address the problems likely to be caused by the malaria parasites in buffalos. “At the domestic level, farmers should pay proper attention to cleanliness and hygiene of the animals. The cattle should be given a regular bath in clean water whereas they also need to stay covered from mosquito bites.”
As no malaria case was found in the wild buffalos during the study, Kandel claims domestic animals are at greater risk, hence improving the way farmers rear the cattle can be a great help.
At the next level, the country needs to improve animal quarantine because the risk of malaria is higher in India than in Nepal. The world’s first case of malaria in a water buffalo was reported in India whereas different recent studies covering Nagpur, Bareilly/Muktesar and Maharashtra have also indicated higher risks. Likewise, other Asian countries such as Vietnam and Thailand also have higher rates of infection, according to Kandel’s report. It is hence significant to tighten the quarantine checking, according to him.
Moreover, other animals might also be suffering from the disease but sufficient research has not been done. Kandel is aware that the sample size of his research was relatively small and should not be generalised to cause terror among farmers and stakeholders. Rather, additional studies should be carried out to determine the severity of malaria in animals of Nepal and plan a coping strategy accordingly, he recommends.",/lifestyle,"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 05:07:58 +0000"
33,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/does-your-body-need-potassium.html,"
Potassium? You may have heard about it but cannot precisely put your finger on it.  Physicians advise on taking 3,500 to 4,700 mg of potassium daily. WHO (the World Health Organization), too, recommends an intake of 3,510 mg per day.  Hang on, this does not mean you pop into your mouth a potassium pill every day! Plenty of food is loaded with this mineral compound to help you meet your daily requirements.
Our body to function properly needs diverse nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water. They are essential for the growth of our bone, flesh, organs, and to maintain body metabolism. What’s more, we need them to keep the diseases at bay and retain overall good health. Potassium as a macro-mineral fulfills one of those essential nutrients.
Mineral electrolyte
Electrolytes are essential minerals found in blood, sweat and urine. Minerals such as sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and potassium form the electrolytes much needed by our body.
Imbalance of electrolytes in the body is caused when we lose fluids as a result of persistent vomiting or diarrhea, sweating or fever. Other causes include: Medications such as steroids, diuretics and laxatives.
 Surprisingly, nearly 80% of the potassium is found in our body cells in the form of fluids like blood, sweat, and plasma. The rest is stored in our bones and liver. 
Biomedical scientists explain that potassium, as an agent, on one hand, regulates the fluid balance in our body and on the other controls the electrical activity of the heart and body muscles. In short, it helps the cellular and electrical functions of our body.
Potassium aids our nerves to function, the muscles to contract, maintain a regular heartbeat, pump nutrients into our body cells and chuck waste products out of them. 
As a mineral electrolyte, this wonderful compound cuts down on the high sodium content in our body. It is said to minimize the risk of stroke, high blood pressure, and the formation of kidney stones. It supports cardiovascular health, safeguards muscle mass and preserves the mineral density in our bones.
Potassium deficiency
Surprisingly, the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, USA) in a survey called NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) revealed a mind-boggling fact that in the United States alone a whopping 98 percent of people fail to meet the daily requirement of 3,500 to 4,700 mg of potassium.
Catherine Collins, a dietician at the St George’s Hospital, Tooting London sheds light on potassium by saying, “We use it to help generate an electrical charge which helps the cell function properly. It helps keep your heart rate steady, it helps trigger insulin release from the pancreas to help control blood sugars, and more importantly, keeps blood pressure in check.”
When the potassium level in our blood is low it’s called hypokalemia. The common symptoms of hypokalemia are fatigue, malaise, muscle aches/cramps, digestive disorder, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, irregular palpitation, numbness of body parts and breathing problem, among others.
Severe potassium deficiency occurs when an adult’s potassium level falls below 3.6 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). In such cases, apart from the symptoms mentioned above, others include low blood pressure, paralysis (as a result of muscle weakness) and respiratory failure.  A simple blood test can give you your exact potassium level.

The role of kidneys
While doing the research work for this write-up I met Dr. Rabin Nepali, who kindly shed light on the role of kidneys vis-à-vis potassium. To quote Dr. Rabin: “The dietary intake of potassium ranges from less than 35 to more than 110 mmol/day in U.S. adults.”
“Despite this widespread variation in intake, homeostatic mechanisms serve to maintain plasma potassium precisely between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L. In a healthy individual at steady state, the entire daily intake of potassium is excreted, approximately 90% in the urine and 10% in the stool.”
Dr Rabin Nepali
“More than 98% of total body potassium is intracellular, chiefly in muscle. The rapid exchange of intracellular potassium with extracellular potassium plays a crucial role in maintaining plasma potassium within such a narrow range; this is accomplished by overlapping and synergistic regulation of a number of renal and extra-renal transport pathways.”
“So, kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining a steady state in potassium metabolism, by excreting excess potassium or reabsorbing it as required by the body.” (Dr. Rabin Nepali, DM Nephrology, Asst. Professor, Teaching Hospital, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu).
Food and not supplements
Yes, do not get taken in by supplements although you are tempted. There are one too many that you can buy over the counter.  Go for dietary sources. There is abundant food brimming with potassium. Not processed food, though as they are high in sodium.
Doctors of medicine argue that natural diets rich in potassium is linked with a lower risk of hypertension (high blood pressure), kidney stones and osteoporosis. Our daily food like meat, poultry, fish, fruits, nuts, and vegetables not only pack various nutrients but also serve as an excellent source of potassium.

Beverages such as milk, coffee and other nonalcoholic drinks too contain a liberal amount of potassium. Let’s take a look at the following chart:
Selected Food Sources of Potassium 
Source: https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/
 
Among the foods highest in potassium are said to be beet greens, white beans, soybeans, and Lima beans.

The benefits of potassium include:
Blood pressure and cardiovascular health
Today, hypertension or high blood pressure has become a commonplace health problem among old and young alike. If not addressed on time, it can lead to grave complications like stroke and heart disease.
Sodium or salt, for one, is closely related to high blood pressure and the doctor advises to cut down on the intake of salt. Now, potassium is said to neutralize to a great extent the negative effects of sodium.
Our kidneys aid to keep our blood pressure in control. They put the amount of fluid stored in our body on an even keel. High blood pressure is associated with the increase in fluid in our bodies. Eating a potassium-rich diet negates the effect of sodium and helps the kidneys to restore the balance—as such, lowering the blood pressure to a healthy level.
Clinicians believe a diet high in potassium can help cut systolic blood pressure by more than 10 counts in people with high blood pressure.  
Talking about heart health, according to WHO, 17.9 million people worldwide die of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) that includes coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and others. Four out of five CVD deaths fall under heart attacks and strokes.
WHO recommends an increase in potassium intake from food (not refined food) to reduce blood pressure and cut down the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart disease. Potassium helps reduce vascular calcification, or to simply put it, mineral deposits on the walls of our arteries and veins. These mineral deposits develop into plaques, thus, increasing the risk of stroke and blood clots.
In a study carried out by medical experts, it was found that “those who consumed 4,069 mg of potassium per day had a 49 percent lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease compared with those who consumed about 1,000 mg per day.”
Diabetes
Diabetes has turned into a growing problem. The soaring prevalence of diabetes is also referred to as “the epidemic of the century.” Once considered to be most common with older people, today, affects younger adults too owing to sedentary lifestyle and diet.
According to IDF (International Diabetes Federation), in 2017, the world diabetes figure remained approximately 425 million adults (20-79 years). IDF further stated that by 2045 the figure might rise to a staggering 629 million.
Studies made by health care professionals have come to new findings that lower levels of potassium in the body are also associated with a higher risk of diabetes. 
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at a high risk of ESRD (kidney failure or end-stage renal disease) and CVD (cardiovascular disease), both of which can result in life-threatening complications.
A research made by Dr. Shin-ichi Araki and several of his co-researchers for the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology claimed that diets rich in potassium may help protect the heart and kidney health of patients with type 2 diabetes.
The experiment was participated in by 623 Japanese with type 2 diabetes.  The trial ran from 1996 to 2003 with a median follow-up period of 11 years. The results showed that higher levels of potassium in the participants’ urine showed a lower risk of renal dysfunction and cardiovascular problems.
Bone and muscle maintenance
A diet high in potassium is closely related to bone health. Potassium-rich foods generate alkali in the body to maintain acid-base balance. High intake of protein-rich foods or acidifying foods such as meat, dairy products, and processed cereals creates acidosis in our bodies, which have a negative effect on our bones and muscles.
Metabolic acidosis causes excretion of nitrogen resulting in loss of bone mineral density, and muscle wasting. On the other hand, potassium-dense food like vegetables and fruits helps neutralize the adverse effects of acidosis build-up in our body. Older people, too, are benefitted by eating potassium-rich food like fruits and vegetables, which preserve their muscle mass and enhance bone density as well.
Caveat
The intake of Potassium, as prescribed by a health care professional, is very beneficial to our overall health. Care should be taken, however, not to exceed the recommended dose of 4,700mg per day.
Individuals with no health problems may easily rid their bodies off the excess amounts through their urine with no adverse effects. Food-related potassium toxicity is considered a rarity but excessive consumption can lead to a complication called hyperkalemia. Our body cannot do without potassium. But it does not need it in excess. The kidneys come to the rescue and reject the unwanted potassium from the blood.
In the case of kidney disease, excess potassium can prove dangerous as the kidneys fail to remove the extra potassium, which stays in the blood cells. This can have grave results, even life-threatening ones and the condition is called hyperkalemia.
All health care providers always advise against an extremely high intake of potassium, especially in such patients who have dysfunctional kidney problems and are on supplements. Potassium levels between 5.1 and 6.0 mmol/L are considered high and need immediate consultation. Levels higher than 6.0 mmol/L are dangerous.
Beetroot
Bottom line
Diet and not supplements are the best source of potassium to meet your body’s requirement. “Let food be thy medicine, and let medicine be thy food.” Those words were said by the ancient Greek founder of western medicine, Hippocrates of Kos, during the Greek Classical Period in the 5th century BC.
No truer words have ever been said, which sounds right to this day. Eat right, stay healthy!

34,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/this-nepali-zoologist-gave-his-name-to-a-snake-now-he-is-concerned-about-peoples-perception-of-the-reptile.html,"Trimeresurus karanshahi. Photo courtesy: Karan Bahadur Shah
Like other children of his neighbourhood, Karan Bahadur Shah was afraid of snakes. At the age of 10, his family migrated to the plains of Kanchanpur from Dadeldhura, and the fear of snakes heightened because more snakebite cases were reported there.
“The fear persisted till I was doing my master’s in zoology in the 20s,” the sexagenarian says, “But later, I developed an affinity towards this reptile because I wanted to do something new in my field.”
Around two decades ago, this pioneer herpetologist discovered a new snake species, and the scientific community named the species after him, an unprecedented achievement in the field of zoology in Nepal. Content with the feat, Shah, now, has a more serious concern–he feels that humans have not understood the importance of snakes. “They rather perceive the serpents as their enemies and kill many of them every year,” he says.
The Phulchoki finding
Since he began studying zoology, Shah was intrigued by snakes. “The number of snake species in Nepal was far less than the number of snake species in India. But I thought Nepal too should be home to at least half of the Indian species because the two countries have similar geographic and climatic conditions.”
As Shah tried his hand at the study of snakes, he got into contact with many scholars from different parts of the world. “During that time, many foreigners would come to Nepal to study various species. The government would allow them to take to other countries the animals and plants they found in Nepal for study,” he says.
It was during the 1996 late monsoon. Shah was hosting a team of international snake researchers. “We went to hills around Kathmandu almost every night for several days,” he recalls, “Then, we decided to do it in the daytime for a few days because it was raining frequently and we thought the snakes would come out in the sun to warm themselves.”
That particular day (he does not remember the date), Shah hired two vehicles for his team to travel up to Godavari in the early morning. They had planned to walk up to Phulchoki hill. His teenage son, Utkrisht, also showed interest in the trip as his school was closed that day.
“But he could not catch up with the adults so I had to leave my friends and walk with him,” he narrates, “I almost forgot my research work as I was busy talking to him. But coming down, something unexpected happened.”
It was past 10 am. The clouds had cleared and the sun had just emerged from the horizon. “Suddenly, I saw a green snake in front of me. As I approached it, the snake crawled towards a nearby hole. I ran towards the hole to catch its tail. Fortunately, I managed to bag it.”
Shah thought that it was just a snake belonging to one of five to six green snake species found in Nepal. He joined his colleagues at the Godavari station and told them about the incident. They photographed the serpent.
The snake remained in Shah’s bag for the next few days. After concluding the study for that season, one of the researchers, Nikolai Orlov from Russia proposed that he take the snake captured by Shah along with him. Shah agreed.
“But, he did not tell me anything about the results of the study for the next few months. Later I found that they took time because the characteristics of that snake did not match that of others. Hence, they suspected if it was a new species,” Shah says, “Orlov visited many other places and summoned specimens from other menageries. Finally, they concluded that the snake belonged to a species not recorded yet.”
The nomenclature
Perhaps the discovery was not an achievement in itself. There was something more Shah should have looked forward to.
Orlov and his friend Notker Helfenberger published their analysis of the same in the Russian Journal of Herpetology (Vol. 4, No. 2, 1997). In the article, the two scientists named the new species as Trimeresurus karanshahi. The snake got named ‘Karan’s Pit Viper’ or ‘Shah’s Pit Viper’ in English, and ‘Karanko Hareu’ in Nepali. The researchers explained, “The species is named after Nepali herpetologist Karan B Shah, whose organising support was principal for realising the expedition” (sic).
Shah felt he was on cloud nine when he received a copy of the journal. He felt his dream “of doing something new” come true as no Nepali zoologist had been able to put his/her name after any species till then. Shah claims there is still no one in zoology who had achieved a similar feat till date though there are some in botany.
Shah believes having his name associated with a species is important because not everyone can achieve that despite discovering new species. “It’s not up to you to name the species you discover. Other researchers should acknowledge your contribution to the discovery, in a scientific journal recognised across the world,” he says. Besides, a number of naming systems exist in the field. It is up to the authors to name the new species after people, places or other characteristics.
Recognising the achievement, the government of Nepal published a postal stamp featuring Karan’s pit viper the next year.
Karan’s pit viper on a postal stamp
Critical concerns
Despite achieving such a ‘celebrated’ status in academia, Shah is not happy with people’s perception of snakes. He says the snakes should not be killed just because of some snakebite incidents.
“We need to understand is that all snakes are not venomous. In fact, only 10 percent of snakes are capable of injecting venom into other living bodies,” he says, “Secondly, all snakebite do not cause injury. Around 50 percent of cases are ‘dry bites’ in which the snakes cannot inject venom inside the human bodies.”
Then, people need to understand the contribution of these reptiles to the ecosystem and let them live freely, according to him. Snakes are carnivores and they balance the ecosystem by eating various insects and small mammals. “They also eat rodents. When applying other measures like poisoning and trapping, yourself could be a victim,” he jokes, “Practically, it is safer to let the serpents eat rodents around you.”
Protecting snakes is also necessary because their venom can be used in various medicines, Shah suggests.
However, he is aware of the tragedies that snakebite can cause. Nepal records around 20,000 snakebite incidents every year, and a few dozen people die. But Shah still argues that killing snakes is not a solution.
“Yes, I know. My brother’s grandson was bitten by a snake in Mahendranagar last year while he was asleep inside the home,” he says, “But, before talking about the risks, we need to keep ourselves safe.”
Shah claims snakes do not bite unless they feel threatened. Hence, people should stay away from snakes. However, during the summers, they frequent human residences in the search of cooler places as the surface and underground temperatures increase. Likewise, when it floods, they come to dry places for safety. “Therefore, during high-risk seasons, stay prepared. Keep your doors and windows closed,” he advises, “Whenever you go out, cover the body with sleeved clothes and boots. Carry a torch if you walk in the dark.”
“Seeking help from shamans and traditional healers is a bigger problem than the snakebite itself,” he says, “The Nepal government gives anti-venoms for free in all of its health facilities and they can save your life.”",/lifestyle,"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 05:18:30 +0000"

When social media users jokingly connected an angry-faced image of Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba with ‘Ghamad Shere’ last week, the movie received some free promotion. Now, as the movie is already being screened, it is clear that the movie is not related to the former prime minister in any way. Yet, the movie is precisely related to Nepal’s political system in which the powerful easily manipulate the law for their vested interests, inconsiderate of common people’s feelings.
Besides being a satire, the movie is a romantic love story. The development of intimacy between two actors, played by the real-life couple of Nischal Basnet and Swastima Khadka, is interesting to watch though it is morally undesirable. Likewise, there are many other things that a critical and sensitive viewer wishes the movie could have avoided. However, the way that the movie interconnects a political satire and a romantic love story is what makes it an interesting watch.
Sharp satire
Ghamad Shere is one step ahead of other contemporary productions in terms of satirising the current political system. Whereas the mainstream media outlets occasionally report the lack of resources at local government bodies to execute the rights delegated by the constitution, the cinema industry had never covered the issue in this depth.
This movie clearly shows how the absence of qualified officials at local government authorities mocks the system. Here in the film, you see a police officer encouraging an innocent individual to file a complaint against a rivulet so as to hide his incompetence. The mayor and his deputy play with the system in cahoots with local power brokers and misinterpret the law while the helpless public continue to remain at the receiving end. This context is somewhat relatable to the reality in Nepal.
As the movie reaches its end, you know that the mishandled political system teaches genuine and honest people also to manipulate existing provisions to meet their vested interests. This film shows how power corrupts people like our hero, Shere (Basnet), illegally launches sand and aggregate-extraction business at the end.
The romance that no one looks forward to
The movie’s only dance number–Kali Man Paryo Malai Gori Man Paryo–is a spoiler in this context. As the song tells you, our hero Shere falls in love with his saali, his wife Parvati (Sushma Niraula)’s cousin named Gauri (Khadka). Since Nepali society always jokes about saali-bhinaju affairs casually, it might not interest you.

Nevertheless, screenwriter and director Hem Raj BC plays a trick to keep the audience hooked: till around 15 minutes before the first half closes, you do not see any possibility of an extramarital knot. Shere is a dipsomaniac and Gauri vehemently hates the habit. Though she shows some intimacy with him whenever they meet, she equally respects him as a bhinaju (brother-in-law).
On the other hand, the hero is also an ethical guy; despite Parvati frequently irritating him about alcoholism, he has never thought of leaving her for another lady. After she fears that he loses all the money that he earned by toiling in a foreign land in the liquor, he has recently deposited Rs 800,000 to her account. The Shere-Parvati couple seems happily married overall; he assists her in doing the dishes whereas they also make TikTok videos occasionally. Though Parvati wants Shere to go back abroad, it seems she is concerned about the family’s livelihood. It hence seems the saali-bhinaju flirtation is just social and it will not develop any further.
But by the end of the first half, you are certain that a marriage between them is imminent. Without giving a hint of it, except the song, the writer-director skillfully forces you to change the perception of the characters along with the plot’s next course.
Because you know how the story will end at the end, the second half is a bit predictable. Yet, you will continue watching it because you want to know how the movie glorifies ‘morally corrupted’ hero and heroine (because, traditionally, all of such stories tend to glorify the protagonists for showing a clear-cut conflict with the antagonists).
Old errors
Despite such attractions, the movie frequently bores you. The project repeats most of the errors that critiques have been pointing at for decades. The first: the cheap way of showing sex. As Shere and Parvati make love on the upper floor, his parents sleeping downstairs feel disturbed. The final sequence also includes an intimate scene, and it does not add any value to the movie. The second: the use of physical disabilities to make people laugh. A minor character of the movie cannot speak fluently and the movie makes fun of him. The third: the unnecessary repetition of the word ‘Ghamad’ to stress the theme. The fourth: including a fight scene at the end though ending the movie before the fight could have made a better sense.

Cinematography-wise, the movie is an average production. The opening scene is cliched; you see a vehicle moving on a serpentine road for around one minute. The camera angle changes but you do not see anything new for the entire minute. Though the director tries to play with radio sounds to set background for a couple of scenes, the sound work fails to make any impact. A rainstorm scene appears out of the blue–it seems quite improbable. But the camerawork is okay.
Acting-wise, the lead actors–Basnet, Khadka, and Niraula–have done their job fairly. Niraula has signaled a promising future in her debut project. Another actor, Roy, also makes an impression. However, no attention has been paid in the making of minor characters. There is a child and he could have made the audience turn emotion in some scenes if he had been trained well.
Verdict
Both as a satire and a love story, this movie has raised concerns over some genuine issues. Thanks to the interesting plot and convincing acting, the movie turns out to be a good watch. If the team succeeds in avoiding some of the formulaic errors, it could produce better movies in the days to come.

It took 400 million years for Earth to evolve. The epic journey was tough, grueling and harrowing for both humans and the denizens of the wild. The biggest challenge for the animal kingdom has, however, been the hominoids—the ‘thinking ape’ as they are sometimes referred to.
 If the evolutionary history of the early primates is to be dug up, the earliest known ancestors of modern-day elephants came 65 million years ago, long before the birth of Homo sapiens in the Paleolithic Stone Age, 2.5 million years ago. The humans came, and the ‘rape’ began. Untold species and numbers of our pre-historic elephants, the rightful early settlers of this planet, were pushed to extinction.
 My first encounter with wild elephants took place at Sainabar in the Bardia Forest, far-west Nepal. I ran into a herd of 12/13 wild elephants foraging in the woods right next to the road on the Mahendra Highway. I was on my way back to Thakurdwara after a day’s fishing at the Babai River.

As elephants are rarely seen in the wild, I was very excited at the prospect of taking some photos at such close quarters. I stopped my motorbike some 20 yards from the herd. But no sooner had I trained the camera on the herd when my guide Sitaram Choudhary, riding pillion, panicked.
I lost my balance, and we nearly toppled over. “Sir, we better not stop here . . . it’s not safe. They can attack anytime, and if they do, we don’t stand the slimmest chance,” he blurted into my ears. I somehow managed a few hurried shots.
As I kicked my motorbike into life, the herd saw us dawdling on the roadside. I saw some commotion amidst the group. Suddenly, one of the elephants, its ears pinned back, turned sharply towards us and charged. As we sped off, I turned back to look. The rushing primate had stopped after a few paces but kept eyeing us suspiciously.
Back at the lodge in Thakurdwara, my guide Sitaram unabashedly admitted that he was all set to abandon me and dash for the nearest woods—the only safe thing to do when being chased by a wild elephant, he said—had I dilly-dallied a little longer. For me, born and bred in the city, the revelation that elephants in the wild could be so dangerous came as a total shock.

Status: endangered        
In 1986, IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) declared the Asian elephant as endangered and listed it on the IUCN Red List. Over the last three generations, the population of Asiatic elephants has declined by at least 50 per cent.  And the outcome can be past hope in another 60 years. This legendary mammal may vanish from the ‘third planet from the Sun,’ the Mother Earth.
Violent
Elephants can be unpredictable. Even captive elephants, which appear very gentle to people, can deceptively turn violent and even turn upon viciously on humans. Untold incidents of unsuspecting people being killed or maimed by domesticated elephants in India and Nepal make the headlines once in a while.
On the other hand, wild elephants are thoroughly aggressive and are notorious for attacking humans on sight.  It’s no secret that in defence, the matriarch African wild elephant can turn into a formidable adversary and fear none—not even the lord of the jungle. They are known to charge into a den of lions when it comes to defending their calves.

Human-Elephant Conflict
Every year, the havoc wrought by wild elephants in Nepal make the headlines on the tabloid press.  “Tuskers kill five in east Nepal”, “Wild elephants create havoc in Dang”, “Two trampled to death in Jhapa”, “Crops destroyed in Bardia” make news stories that are depressing and sad to read. But it is a brutal fact that every year during harvest time of corn and paddy, wild elephants in the east or west on the Nepal plains (Terai) go on the rampage.
People lose their hard-earned crops, livestock, property, and at times, even their lives. For both, the humans and the elephants, it’s a harrowing experience.
The reason for these sporadic outbreaks of savagery by wild elephants is, however, not far to seek. In truth, they have been deprived of their natural habitat and driven out of their homes. And the violence has stemmed from the long-drawn-out injustice meted out to them.
An endearing moment: mother cow and calf. Image: author
The tuskers, who once freely roamed the abundant Terai forest, have had their habitat encroached upon, fragmented and destroyed by humans. Farmers have arbitrarily laid claim to what was once their home turf.
While it took eons for the pristine forests to take shape, human greed for more land led to massive destruction of these jungles, forcing wild elephants now to trespass on human habitation.

Status
The status of wild elephants in Nepal is far from satisfactory. The National Park and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973 accorded them a protected status. Categorized as an endangered species by IUCN, the World Conservation Union under CITES lists them in Appendix I.
As with the entire Indian sub-continent, and continental Southeast Asia, the reasons behind the dramatic decline of Asiatic elephants in Nepal, too, are much the same. The human-elephant conflict has taken a nasty turn.
If the elephant raids end up in the destruction of property, loss of livelihood and even human lives, elephants, in human retaliation, fall prey to poisoning, electrocuting and shooting. Worst hit is the villages and buffer zones (the immediate areas inhabited by humans surrounding the national parks and reserves).

Habitat loss, depletion of forestland for human settlement, agriculture and development work, hunting for ivory, illicit logging, excessive collection of fodder and firewood, and to some extent, capturing for domestication are the many causes.
In Africa, the modus operandi of slaughtering elephants in the wild reached an all-time high when cyanide was used. In 2013, “poachers killed 300 elephants in Zimbabwe’s Hwange National Park by poisoning their water supply and salt licks.”
Deforestation
Nepal’s massive deforestation was brought about by the Malaria Eradication Program in the 1950s, which also triggered a mass exodus of hill people to the fertile plains. This was followed by the Terai resettlement scheme in the 1960s, implementation of the Land Reform Program in 1979, and the infrastructure development work like the Mechi to Mahakali, Mahendra East-West Highway. All brought in their wake massive destruction of forests—the haven for wild elephants.
From 1950 to 1980, Nepal has lost almost half of its forest cover. In the 1990s, the lush primary forests vanished at a rate of 200 hectares a day (1.7% annually in the Terai plains), precipitating grave ecological and climatic changes.
On the Run
It has taken 400 million years for the planet Earth that we live on today to evolve—an epic journey, a formidable challenge, tough, grueling and harrowing for both humans and the denizens of the wild. The biggest challenge for the animal kingdom, as always, has, however, been the hominoids—the ‘thinking ape’ as they are sometimes referred to.
If the evolutionary history of the early primates is to be dug up, the earliest known ancestors of modern-day elephants came 65 million years ago, long before the birth of Homo sapiens in the Paleolithic Stone Age, 2.5 million years ago. The humans came, and the ‘rape’ began; untold species and numbers of our pre-historic elephants, the rightful early settlers of this planet, were pushed to extinction.

Enjoying no more than a ‘refugee’ status today, always on the run, the impending doom for the wild elephants still lurks somewhere near the surface. According to Dr. Dinesh Neupane, every year, two to three elephants succumb to retaliatory actions by local communities.
“We have always been very fond of elephants, but because of our deeds, this creature is disappearing. So far, all conservation and management plans are about confining them to protected areas. We have not been able to admit that we have encroached on their lands,” says Dinesh Bhuju, General Secretary at the Resources Himalaya Foundation.
Once just an innocent Denizen of the jungle, is, today, considered a liability. And it’s one of life’s little ironies that the so-called Homo sapiens—who were the cause of all the sufferings, worse, the extinction of one of the earth’s rarest inhabitants—are supposed to referee the remedies today!   

We had 350 known species of elephants—only two remain today—yet still—threatened. Are we to look away when the stark truth stares us in the face? Are we to take that the last vestiges of these pre-historic hairy mammoths, too, are fated to turn into lifeless stony fossils like their extinct ancestors?

37,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/hong-xiang-restaurant-review-not-as-good-as-hype.html,"The restaurant also serves some good noodle dishes
As Chinese President Xi Jinping left Kathmandu after a hyped two-day visit recently, I had a sudden urge to try Chinese food. After being disappointed with Chinese eateries in Thamel, I really wanted to try some good Chinese food. However, after having lunch at Hong Xiang Restaurant in Baneshwor, I felt the restaurant was not less hyped than the President’s trip. Also, the menu was a tad overpriced.
Hong Xiang isn’t solely a restaurant. It’s a hotel that hosts a lot of Chinese tourists. The restaurant basically caters to these tourists. However, over the past few years, it has also been getting many Nepali customers.
Even though I was there around lunchtime, the restaurant was pretty empty. The place is quite spacious with huge round tables which made it evident that it gets a lot of groups. But the place doesn’t have tables for two people. If it’s getting so many people, maybe the tables for two should also be the restaurant’s priority. Décor-wise, the place is quite bland too. While many Chinese restaurants make you feel you’re in China, this one didn’t have that feeling. Its got some huge posters of Chinese destinations, but apart from that and the round tables, you might feel that you are in an Indian restaurant.
The menu was quite vast too. It had a wide range of hot and cold starters along with a good range of vegetarian and fish options as well. But what was a bit disappointing was the food items did not have descriptions which makes it hard for us Nepalis to figure out what would actually come out. Another problem with the place was it did not have a POS machine; if you’re going there make sure you take sufficient cash.

The first dish I tried was the Sichuan-style fried chicken. The dish with sticky rice was full of flavour. It was a bit sour, pungent and a spicy and had a distinct aroma to it. It was quite ideal for a Nepali tastebud. I’d say it had the perfect blend of Sichuan peppers and spices. Definitely worth a try.

The second dish I tried was the hot buff with black mushrooms. The dish was huge. I was quite disappointed that the waiter didn’t tell us that the dish was for more than two people. It feels like they aren’t trained and need to communicate better with their customers. Taste-wise, it was alright. But I think the dish was way too spicy. The buff meat was decent as black mushrooms added some nice flavour to the dish, but the overuse of Sichuan peppers and dried chilly just wouldn’t let you enjoy the meat. The broth with which the food came was quite nice; if it was a bit less spicy, people would actually like to enjoy it. If you really like spicy food, you can try it, but only if in a group. The dish can be enough for up to four people, easily.
Even though I wanted to try more items, the buff dish killed my appetite and I called it a day.
Overall, I think the place is average. There are a lot of places which serve such food for a more reasonable price. Most of the starters were above Rs 700 as were the mains. Many small Chinese eateries in Thamel definitely serve you the same food for a relatively reasonable price.

38,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/poi-paryo-kale-movie-review-though-fictitious-and-exaggerated-this-movie-is-a-fun-watch.html,"
Looking at the title of this week’s Kollywood release, you might not want to go watch Poi Paryo Kale. Many people consider the term ‘Poi’ (which means ‘husband’) derogatory whereas the entire title suggests the movie is a cheap comedy that includes a lot of racism and skin-colour shaming as a medium of making the audience laugh. The initial few minutes of the movie do not change your expectations.
While you are yet to figure out the opening scene, the narrator tells you a boring story–a black nurse took care of a girl when she was born, later a black boy pushed her into a hole and a series of over a dozen sentences, each using the word ‘black’.
But, wait till the second half and you will find the movie a fun game, with a clear social message, though the plot is essentially fictitious.
Parody of colourism
Tolerate the ‘torture’ of the first few minutes; then the movie will free you from your fear that it makes fun of someone’s skin colour to make you laugh. Rather, the movie turns out to be a parody; it attacks the narrow-mindedness of people who do not like the black-skinned just because of the colour. The exaggerated narrative about the girl’s birth and childhood also gets justified here because parodies, by nature, are exaggerated.

This movie clarifies that exaggerations do not necessarily mean something negative. In artworks, portraying an exaggerated situation can improve the effectiveness of communications. The lead character of the movie Puja Sharma (it is the name shared by the actress and her role in the movie) not only hates black people and things, but she also cries so loudly in the very beginning ‘I hate black.’ It makes the movie easily comprehensible to everyone.
As the movie progresses, the parody gradually develops into a lesson that hating people on the basis of colour is nonsensical. This part is also exaggerated and beyond what you could imagine having existed in reality, but it is capable enough of imparting the intended lesson via a unique plot.
Unusual plot
You can sense the unusualness of the movie’s plot as you see ‘Madhyantar’ (Intermission) on the screen a couple of minutes after the curtains open. But the movie does not give you any second to think about what happened as you overhear the unseen narrator (Kedar Ghimire). He clarifies that the audience needs to learn about what happened before the first scene to call it the intermission. Then the movie goes into flashback. It continues till the intermission.
Because the exaggeration is over the top, you might find the first half boring. However, the second half improves because it involves a drama that you have never imagined. This is also an exaggeration but it is interesting to see characters of a film orchestrating another drama inside the story. It feels that Poi Paryo Kale is a metafictional work that shows you how artists create stories out of their ordinary life.

Because of the genre, you know how the movie ends–satires generally expose the truth and teach the characters a lesson at the end, leaving them disillusioned. But still, the movie is capable of keeping the audience hooked as you still do not know how exactly Puja learns her lesson. On the other hand, the impacts of her shortsightedness in the drama inside the movie are too imminent, and you wonder how she will avoid that.
If the screenwriter Shishir Rana had made the plot more realistic while retaining the unusualness, it would have been really a powerful story.
Acting and cinematography
Despite the loose story, the movie has not deviated from the focus, mainly because the key actors have given justice to their roles. Puja Sharma has been given an emotionally tumultuous role in the movie, but she has done faultless acting here. In fact, the entire movie is her journey from an illusion to disillusionment and she handles it quite well. Saugat Malla looks too gentle, perfect for his role as an orphaned but rich young businessman.
Aakash Shrestha also deserves some appreciation in the movie because he has tried a different role this time. In his previous movies, he was shown as an idealistic lover; but here he is a carefree and mischievous young man. He seems improving, but not polished yet. Shristi Shrestha is okay as an urban girl, but she has failed to make an impression.

Veteran comedian Rajaram Poudel had bored his audience with cheap jokes and confusing multiple roles in some of his recent projects including Dal Bhat Tarkari, Jatrai Jatra and Na Yeta Na Uta. He has improved this time and been able to make the audience laugh, logically. Screenwriter and director Rana and comedian Gopal Dhakal ‘Chhande’ have done justice to their roles. Experienced Surakshya Panta has been given a minor role in this movie; she has not been able to contribute as much as what she could.
As a director, Rana’s job is average because the movie, overall, is a mediocre project from the cinematographic perspective. Taking the help of an unseen narrator to connect different times suggests the director’s failure to establish the connection visually. On the other hand, he has failed to differentiate the scenes that actually happen and what Puja fears could happen. For example, an overthinking Puja fears that her domestic workers can tell her friends who her husband is before she introduces him to them, it does not happen; but the audience gets confused as there is nothing to suggest that this is just a hallucination.
Meanwhile, he has not made sincere efforts in the making of supportive characters. For example, most of the friends who act Puja’s friends do not look natural.

Verdict
Poi Paryo Kale is not a polished work. However, director Shishir Rana seems to have improved from his directorial debut Timi Sanga; at least he has made a better movie than veteran Ashok Sharma’s Rato Tika Nidharma. (The movies are comparable because they belong to the same genres.)
While retaining the strengths of his story and moviemaking such as a unique plot and coverage of neglected issues, he needs to improve on reducing overdramatisation and connecting the story to real life.

39,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/beasts-that-surpass-all-in-intelligence.html,"Of all the wild animals in the world, they are said to be the most sensitive by nature—nothing short of humans. They play, cry, and . . . laugh, too!
They are “powerful, sentient, intelligent, sensitive, naughty, playful, emotional, perceptive, resilient, intuitive, compassionate, intimidating, curious, complex, and loyal to the bone.” Jaws drop. Heads turn. People freeze in their tracks. Kids scamper up chortling with delight as this hulking figure lumbers by majestically.
The 12th of August, every year, is dedicated to this largest terrestrial mammal on this planet: the elephant. The day marks the World Elephant Day. Let us also devote a little of our time and get to know this gargantuan ‘wonder’ a little closer.
Obedient and Intelligent 
For their unwieldy size and a deceptively meek bearing, the elephants belie their intelligence to a phenomenal level. Whether in the zoo, or a safari in one of our National Parks, it lets you ride on its back . . . so docile and obedient like a child. If you have visited Chitwan National Park, you must have had this experience.

Give some bananas to a park-owned elephant, and it gently tugs at your sleeve with its flailing trunk for some more. That leaves you thrilled to the core. One word, a nudge from the mahout, and it lowers itself down to its knees, lets you climb up its trunk onto its back, or perform such tricks as standing on its hind legs or folding its enormous forelegs in a show of respect.
Once, while on an elephant ride in the Chitwan National Park, I dropped my camera-lens cover to the ground. No sweat! The mahout stopped the elephant, prodded it a little on its flanks by his feet and barked out some words. Lo and behold, the gentle giant gingerly picked it up with its prehensile trunk and handed it back to the mahout! I was tickled to the bone!

Curiously, African forest elephants have two finger-like growths at their trunk tips. Their Asian cousins have only one. Called the proboscides, they work like our fingers and help them grasp food and other tiniest of objects.
Whether it is performing amazing circus feats, playing polo, soccer or even painting colourful pictures on an easel, this colossal ‘beast of burden’ has proven its mettle all over the world.
Sensitive and emotional
Of all the wild animals in the world, elephants, or ‘pachyderms’ are said to be the most sensitive by nature—nothing less than humans. Did you know that they play, cry, and . . . laugh, too?
They are so susceptible that if a baby calf, the cynosure of the herd so much as whines, the entire family, ill at ease, rushes over to nuzzle and caress it. Their display of respect and empathy for every family member is exemplary. When a lost member reunites with the herd, it is greeted by the rest with benign affability.
When talking about feelings and emotions, the elephants have, by far, an edge over other animals, domesticated or wild. If a calf is stillborn, if any member of the herd is in distress, or when death strikes one of the family members—they grieve like humans.

Legendary memory
They are said to have a legendary memory. “You might know 200 people. Well, an elephant might know 500 or 1000 elephants. It’s got to remember every single one of those to get along well with its friends. So yes, elephants have fabulous memories, and this is one of the things that makes them so special,” writes, elephant ecologist Stephen Blake.
An Icon
For millenniums, elephants evoked a sense of awe in human beings. More so culturally in Asia.  Elephant lore is plentiful. To the followers of Hinduism, this creature identifies itself as the best known and the most widely worshipped deity in the Hindu pantheon, Ganesha or Ganpati. If you care to observe, you will run into a Ganesh idol or a temple virtually at every Kathmandu Street—virtually every nook and corner.
A Ganesh idolImage: author
Part human, part elephant, the son of Lord Shiva and Parvati, Ganesha is invoked by all as the icon of intellect and wisdom, a patron of arts, lord of success and sciences, and destroyer of evils. The great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, vividly relates great battles fought and won with elephants as war vehicles.
To one and all, the women folks and kids more so, the sight of a domesticated elephant evokes awe, respect, affection, and deep veneration as it is identified with God Ganesha. People even touch it devoutly as it lumbers by.
Overview
African vs. Asian
Elephants are near-ungulates. They have toenails rather than hooves. The word elephant that has its roots in Latin comes from two words: ‘ele’ meaning arch and ‘phant’ meaning huge.
Among several species of pre-historic elephants, only the following genera are found today—the African elephant (Loxodonta Africana): the African Bush or also called Savannah elephant (Loxodonta Africana Africana), the African Forest elephant (Loxodonta Africana Cyclotis), and the Asiatic elephant (Elephas Maximus): the Indian elephant (Elephas Maximus Indicus), the Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas Maximus Maximus), and the Borneo pygmies (Elephas Maximus Borneensis).
The largest recorded elephant in the world lived for 82 years and was shot in Angola in 1956. It was the largest and weighed 12,000 kilograms (26,455 lbs.), and was, 4.2 m (14 ft.) tall at the shoulder.

Very similar at first glance, African and Asiatic elephants differ anatomically. Sway backed and with a tapering head, the African elephant bears larger ears that are oddly similar to the shape of the African Continent.
The Asiatic elephant, on the other hand, is smaller than its African counterpart, is hump-backed, holds a huge domed head and bears smaller ears that curiously match the shape of the Indian Continent.
Unlike the African elephants who bear tusks(proboscis) regardless of gender, only the Asiatic bull elephants bearlarge external tusks; females have only ‘tushes’: incisors that stick out beyond the upper lip. They have five toes on the front feet and four on the back, unlike their African cousins, which have four on the front and only three on the back.
The African elephants can weigh as much as 10 to 12 tons and measure 12 to 13 ft. whereas their Asian relatives weigh from 2½ to 5 tons and measure 9 to 10 ft. in height at the shoulder.
Both Asiatic and African bulls are almost twice the size of their adult female partner. The gestation period for an Asiatic elephant is between 19 and 22 months (a little longer for the African). Both species breed at the age of 15 years and bear offspring (normally one) up to 50 years. Their life expectancy is very similar to humans – 60 to 70 years, or more.
During one of my visits to the Chitwan National Park, a game scout at the jungle lodge I was staying in, demonstrated an ingenious way of estimating the height of an elephant by measuring the circumference of its footprint and multiplying it by two. Everyone at the camp was thrilled!

Distribution
African bush elephants: Tropical rainforests of West and Central Africa. African savannah elephants: Eastern and southern Africa (Botswana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia).
Asiatic elephants: The Indian sub-continent (Nepal, India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh); continental Southeast Asia (China, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Kampuchea, Malaysia and Vietnam); and Asian islands (Andaman, Sri Lanka, Sumatra, and Borneo).
Behaviour
Matriarchal by behaviour, elephants, both African and Asiatic, live in a group of structural social order made up of mothers, daughters, sisters, and aunts. Such groups are led by the eldest females. Adult males mostly live solitary lives.
World Population
More than 100,000 Asian elephants may have existed at the start of the 20th century, but numbers have fallen by at least 50% over the last three generations, and they are still on the decline today.
In the late 1930s, African elephants numbered nearly 10 million; dropped disastrously to 1.3 million in the late 1970s and 600,000 in the late 1980s. Never abundant as their African cousins, and even more endangered, Asiatic elephants find their origin in the mammoth (Mammuthus), now extinct.
Asiatic Elephant
In 2016, wildlife experts estimated that Africa’s elephant population had dropped by 111,000 elephants in a decade. Today, there are just 415,000 elephants (WWF) across the African Continent.
At the turn of the 20th century, the population of the Asian elephant was estimated to be 200,000 (approx.). Today, there are fewer than 60,000 of which 38 to 53 thousand are found in the wild, 14 to 15 thousand are domesticated, and a thousand are scattered around zoos.
The number of resident wild elephants in Nepal was estimated to be between 109 and 142 animals (occurring in Eastern, Central, and Far-western region. DNPWC 2008).  Some experts believe the figure fluctuates from 100 to 170 as transboundary migration to India takes place at Terai borders. The total number of elephants in captivity stands at 170.
“If you’re not outraged, then I beg you to take a little time just learn about elephants… They’re worth fighting for and we owe it to them to protect them,” Ellen DeGeneres.

Though the ruling Nepal Communist Party is yet to begin formal discussions on electing the new speaker in the House of Representatives after the resignation of Krishna Bahadur Mahara in October, insiders believe the leadership must be thinking about some possible names.
Before the Cabinet reshuffle last month, the party’s chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal had demanded that the position be held by a leader of the former CPN-Maoist Centre side, but another chairman, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, had reportedly rejected the proposal. The prime minister instead wants to see his confidant and four-time House leader Subas Chandra Nembang as the speaker again, a source close to the discussion between the two chairs had revealed.
So, will Nembang become the speaker yet again?
In a brief conversation with Onlinekhabar, Nembang refuses to clearly comment on the issue but hints that he is ready to shoulder the responsibility if the party decides so.
“Instead of making personal claims, I wish the parties and Parliament could elect a lawmaker as the speaker who can meet needs of the House and the country,” a diplomatic Nembang says, “I do not want to make any comment.”
He also reveals that the party leadership has asked him not to say anything about the issue publicly. “The leaders told me the party and Parliament would decide. They said, ‘Why do you make comments? We do whatever we need to do. Please do not speak anything’.”
After repeatedly asked if he is ready to become the speaker again, Nembang says, “If such a situation comes, let’s discuss this issue at the right time and reach an appropriate conclusion.”",/political,"Mon, 09 Dec 2019 06:15:02 +0000"

Around three weeks after he was appointed the ‘executive’ chairman of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is revitalising all units of the party at all levels.
Though it has already been more than one year since the then CPN-UML and the CPN-Maoist Centre announced their merger to form the NCP, the party is yet to form various committees. Among the already formed committees, many are yet to function properly.
The nine-member secretariat has been taking decisions about major issues whereas it has been months since the standing committee and the central committee held their meetings. The politburo is yet to be formed.
Likewise, the party has appointed chiefs for 32 internal departments but they are yet to get the full shape. Many sister organisations have not been unified.
In this context, Dahal wants to complete all the tasks related to the unification as soon as possible and launch a nationwide cadre mobilisation campaign, according to sources close to him.
As the first preparatory step, he is likely to call a standing committee meeting. The secretariat meeting scheduled for Monday is expected to fix the standing committee meeting date, according to the party leader Devendra Paudel, who recently met Dahal.

The NCP retained the House of Representatives seat in Kaski-2 and the Provincial Assembly seat in Dang 3(B). However, it lost the previously won Provincial Assembly seat of Bhaktapur 1(A). With the NCP’s support, Rastriya Janamorcha retained the Provincial Assembly seat in Baglung 2(B).

US private equity firm Silver Lake acquiring a stake in the City Football Group (CFG), owners of English Premier League football team Manchester City, is a stunning development. Based in California, the investor has taken a 10% share in CFG for £380 million, valuing the group at almost £4 billion. Headlines have inevitably hailed the deal as one that makes Manchester City the world’s most valuable football club.
There is no doubt that the east Manchester outfit is a much more valuable asset than it was just over a decade ago. When current owner Sheikh Mansour (a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family) bought Manchester City in 2008, he paid £210 million.
But valuing football clubs is not necessarily a precise science, as the proliferation of valuation rankings demonstrates. At the same time, CFG is not just Manchester City alone. It is a group of clubs and related commercial activities that has been built up across the world.
So to imply that City is the world’s most valuable club is slightly disingenuous. Nevertheless, the punt that Silver Lake has just taken on CFG reveals a great deal about the trajectory its business is on.
The Disney of sport
Nearly 20 years ago the group’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, was vice president and finance director of Spain’s FC Barcelona. During his spell there, Soriano spoke of his vision to build a football club in the image of the Walt Disney empire.
He foresaw the convergence of entertainment and sport in a globalising world. And he also highlighted the role that franchising could play in football, along with the contribution that merchandise could make to club revenues.
Fast forward several years and by 2012 Soriano was in charge at CFG. Released from the political constraints of working for Barcelona (where board members are elected by fans, known as “socios”) and instead underwritten by the petrodollars of Abu Dhabi, the Catalan business leader was given the resources and autonomy to transform the organisation.
Since then, CFG has established franchise clubs around the world, including the US, Australia, Japan, Spain, and Uruguay. Latest news also indicates that CFG are on the verge of acquiring a club in Mumbai, India. No surprise that the city has a sizeable community of football fans, but is also the spiritual home of Bollywood and a focal point for India’s tech sector.
In 2015, CFG’s financial and political fortunes were further boosted as a Chinese investor took a stake in the business. Tellingly, the deal was announced during Chinese president Xi Jinping’s visit to the UK, during which he met then prime minister David Cameron and all manner of football, business and political deals were agreed.
So it was no surprise when, earlier this year, CFG announced plans to establish a Chinese club franchise (in Chengdu). At the same time, Abu Dhabi announced that its state airline Etihad (Manchester City’s shirt and stadium sponsor) would be enhancing its links with Chengdu’s airport. At CFG, football is often the means to an end, not just an end in itself.
Manchester City’s main sponsor.

No Mickey Mouse pursuit
Many of these deals were overseen by Soriano who, in the midst of it all, was also closely monitoring and responding to technological changes. Notwithstanding his original Disney vision, the nature of the movie, broadcasting and sport industries has changed dramatically over the last decade – meaning that football and entertainment are no longer Mickey Mouse pursuits.
New digital platforms have emerged, streaming has taken hold and content generation has become the fuel adding impetus to a new industrial revolution. Indeed, CFG has already taken advantage of this through, for instance, the development of its Cityzens platform and the club’s involvement in the Amazon TV series All or Nothing.
The investment made by Silver Lake in CFG is a clear acknowledgement that football is a globally compelling product, a superb source of content, and a basis upon which shrewd business people can make a profit. More importantly, as if further evidence was needed, it marks the latest move in a convergence of sport, entertainment and digital technology.
With Ferran Soriano providing his foresight and strategy, and Sheikh Mansour providing the money and politics of a wealthy new state seeking its place in the world, Silver Lake is set to bring entrepreneurial zeal and a strong track record of successful tech investments. This should help CFG, and more specifically the various franchises within the group, to establish a competitive advantage over their football rivals.
As such, CFG is at the apex of what it means to be a 21st century football business – a mixture of money, entertainment, technology and politics. Clubs like Red Bull Salzburg and Leipzig are following their own franchise path, while a growing number of teams across Europe have had fly-on-the-wall documentary series made about them. Bayern Munich and Real Madrid take their digital footprints very seriously, while French champions Paris Saint Germain has a Qatari owner.
It is currently only CFG that brings everything together in one place, however. And it is on this basis that Silver Lake has invested in what was once a football club with historic roots in the working class communities of east Manchester, but is now a global entertainment business catapulted to the top of the football’s valuation charts.

If you talk to any player, they will tell you that they want to be playing. When you play, the feeling is different from that when you are on the sidelines. But I’m enjoying watching our boys play in whites. It’s been a while since Nepal played three-day cricket, which in itself is good for us going forward.
Don’t you think the team needs you during this transition phase? Why aren’t you playing? 
I’d asked the management to not put my name in the T-20 and three-day squad. However, I did want to play in the 50-over match. Sadly, due to health reasons, I could not play in that one.
So you’re disappointed no to play?
I wouldn’t say disappointed. It’s just part of a cricketer’s life, to be honest. You’ll obviously miss some games in your career. As I missed out, someone else has got a chance to play for Nepal so I wouldn’t stay I am disappointed.
After this, you’re going to Dubai to play the T-10 league. Is it a coincidence that you were selected to take part in the league after you resigned as captain? 
Well, you have to call it a coincidence. I think I received an offer to play the T-10 league five days after I resigned as captain. When the approach was first made, I was quite unsure. I consulted with family, friends, and coaches who told me that it’s a great opportunity and that I should go play.
I had decided to take a break from cricket as a whole, but coaches told me that this was too big an opportunity to miss out on. It’s funny that I left one thing and got something back in return. But as I said, this is just a coincidence.
I’m looking forward to it as well. I want to play and prove to the team that I can do well in the competition. I will be representing Nepal in the league and if I do will it can open doors for other cricketers as well.
Personally, what is your view on T-10 league? 
Well, this is new to me. As a player, you want to play in these global franchise leagues. I’ve got an opportunity and I feel lucky to have got it. It’s a different format and I’m excited. I hope I can justify my team buying me. But that said, I think I’ll play the way that I always play – giving 100 per cent. It’s a good opportunity and I hope more Nepali cricketers will get this opportunity.
Is this the beginning of Paras Khadka’s international franchise career? 
As it’s the first time I’ll be playing international franchise cricket, you can call it the beginning.

Are you hopeful that this will open the door to popular T-20 leagues like IPL, BBL CPL?
That will depend on my performance. I know Nepali cricket fans want players like me to play in these league but it depends on my performances. If you do well, international cricket will recognise you. Which is why my aim is to play good cricket.
Some have been saying that these franchise leagues were not your priority when you were captain. Is that true? 
I feel playing international T-20 leagues like IPL, CPL, and BBL is every cricketer’s dream. Me being captain does not affect that dream I think. But I will say that as a captain you have to think about a lot of things. I’ve tried my best to do what is good for Nepali cricket. Some decisions that I’ve made have been correct and similarly, I have also made some bad decisions.
What feel is right now I can just concentrate on playing cricket and playing well. I have nothing else to worry about and I guess that is going to be fun. Cricket is something that will stay with me for life. I will not be able to go away from it. The best thing for me is the ball hitting the middle of my bat. I want to play cricket. I have no other agenda right now. But I do feel a bit relieved as I am no longer the captain.
Had you wished to be part of the IPL or other leagues for that matter? 
I’d say yes. But if you ask this to any cricketer they will say yes. I wouldn’t just say IPL. No cricketer would say no if you asked him to play in a franchise league. What I feel sad about is we have only been able to play one world cup. We have failed to qualify for the ODI World Cup and have missed out on 2/3 T-20 World Cups. Had we played in these tournaments, we would have had more exposure. I guess it would have opened the door for more competitions. That said, I do feel we can play in these tournaments in the future. I think we are more than capable. But for that, all of us need to come together.
Do you think your performances in Singapore was the reason for your selection in the T-10 league? 
Maybe. Because in cricket they say one catch can change a match and one innings can change a career. Maybe that 100 in Singapore is that innings for me.
Are you talking to Pakistan Super League and other leagues as well? 
I’ve sent my name for the PSL draft. But I don’t know if I’ll be selected. Let’s see what happens. People were asking me if I will play in the Emerging Nations or the T-10. I do feel the country should always come first, but I had already committed to play the T-10 league. I asked our coach Umesh Patwal if it was fine with me playing in the T-10 league and he told me to go. He told me that young players will be given a change instead of me which is why I decided to go to Dubai. But in the future, if the choice is between country and franchise team, I’ll always choose the country.
As you said, one inning can change a player’s career. Can we expect such an inning during the T-10 league? 
I cannot guarantee anything like that. But that said, I will try. In this sport, as you play along you get to create records. For me what’s important is that the team wins.",/sports,"Thu, 07 Nov 2019 09:57:18 +0000"
61,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-buried-kingdom-of-simraungadh.html,"
In 2012, I visited Simraungadh, a quintessential Terai town, some 160 km south of Kathmandu. The trip was not planned but a last-minute decision—no more than one of my little quirks. But, much to my astonishment, it turned out the little-known town once prided as a thriving capital city of Mithila kingdom in the 11th century Karnata Dynasty.
After rounding off our pilgrimage to the Gadhimai, a Hindu shrine 20 km northeast of the border city Birgunj, I suggested my wife, Radhika, we pay a visit to Simraungadh, 13 km away. The whole idea of the sudden foray was to dig for clues to my ancestral roots, the early Dolakhes, the people of Dolakha, a hill-town 143 km northeast of Kathmandu.
To Radhika, my idea founded on hearsay (talked about by elders in Dolakha) sounded nothing short of a wild-goose chase. With the puja ritual wrapped up at Gadhimai (the Hindu shrine is also noted for holding the largest animal sacrifice in the world every five years), we drove off to Simraungadh.
Dismal start                                                                                                    
We were in for some bad vibes, however. We met a local who told us that only a week ago, a fellow was found murdered on the road to Simraungadh. Another fanned the flames by quipping in that the road cut across some isolated forest stretches was frequented by Indian dacoits.  That gave Radhika quite a fright. I thought the inside stories were a trifle exaggerated, if not just gossip. I managed to get her acquiescence reluctantly, though. There were three of us, Radhika, a priest from Gadhimai who kindly volunteered to guide us, and I. I was behind the wheel of our Hyundai Getz.
Our progress on the badly pitted road was slow, almost a crawl at some places. Some sections of the dirt road required weaseling out of a lot of potholes. All this time, as we sped past deserted locales and wooded stretches, an edgy Radhika kept on casting suspicious looks outside the window.
As we drove along, vast swathes of harvest-ready rice fields flanked the road with thin habitation and insignificant motor traffic—all the more reason for Radhika to get worked-up. All we intercepted, less than halfway, was a solitary bullock-cart lurching along the uneven road with gunny sacks piled high.
The archetypal Terai
Radhika sighed in relief as a few motorbikes and trucks passed by kicking up clouds of dust. Soon, we cruised past small shanty settlements with thatched-roofed mud house, some tiled—the kind so typical about the Terai. We saw men and women going about their ways, some walked, others rode bicycles. The most common sight included women ambling along the side of the road with some kind of a load balanced on their covered heads. Curiously, most of the women, old and young alike, wore white dhotis sans blouses.
As we drove on, I noticed roadside clapboard shops on stilts selling all and sundry but with hardly any customer. Mango groves, Jamun (Indian blueberry), and coconut trees dotted the distant fields. The entire landscape gave a sleepy and deserted look.
Everyone gave a curious look at our passing car, even domestic cattle. While people stopped to look, stray cows, buffaloes, and goats turned their heads at us wide-eyed. Some even spooked.   Excited children ran along the side of the car. Pariah dogs gave a chase barking furiously.
The smell that wafted through our car windows was distinct– burning leaves and the dung-cakes. A strong pungent smell of molasses, at times, stung our nostrils. There was no mistaking the Terai!  Those outer reaches seemed to be under a spell in a timeless past, inching away at its own pace, untouched or undisturbed by the urban boom.
Unusual traffic
After an hour’s dusty ride, we finally arrived in Simraungadh. Nothing looked new, no different from another of those dreary impoverished village towns you see in the terai. The town area boasted a little modernity with crummy tea-houses and shops lining the streets. Modern brick houses and mud hamlets, however, seemed grossly at odds as they huddled together back-to-back.

Squalor and poverty lay behind the town’s incongruous modern façade. The main bazaar bustled with life. Bicycles, rickshaws, motorbikes, tractors, bullock carts, stray animals and occasional tangas (horse-carts) made up the traffic. People milled around amid blaring music belting out Hindi film tunes. Dust and filth appeared all around. Chaos!
After parking our car, we looked around for some help. We wanted to find people who might know about the Dolakhes. I intercepted an elderly dhoti-clad gentleman and asked him. After a quizzical long look at us, he suggested in his broken Nepali we try the main bazaar chowk (square).

Disappointment
In that part of the Terai, the predominant language was Maithili and Bhojpuri. People seemed uncomfortable at speaking Nepali. At the main bazaar, we approached a young fellow in jeans. He looked like a student but all we got from him was a shake of his head. A skeptical Radhika suggested trying some shops. We did but to no avail. After an hour of running around, the dust, the din, and the noonday sun took their toll on us. We were sweating hard and exhausted.
Then, a glimmer of hope… A middle-aged fellow we met at the bazaar asked us to try a certain street. Off we went looking. Some 15 minutes later, we found it. Much to our consternation, we met a family there from Gorkha, and not Dolakha. Blast it! Our informant must have got confused by the similar-sounding words.

With fallen faces, we tried everything; we met on our way back. Our efforts seemed futile. It was time to quit, I thought. So much for my ancestor-hunting! We decided to take a look around the village-town, though.
Tour of the town
Lunch at a roadside eatery proved far-out. To our amazement, the food was served on newsprint paper—a tingling spicy mutton curry with bhuja (dry-roasted rice grain) with slices of onion and radish. The garnishing included a wedge of lemon and a green chilly. For me, the lunch proved an ordeal since I was not used to fiery hot food.
Kankali Mai
After lunch, we first visited the Kankali Ishra Mata Shrine. Going by history, it was after 1800 BCE that the Indo-Aryans first started building Hindu temples of worship. The locations they chose were picturesque places. Small wonder: Hindu shrines are found mostly on river banks, hilltops, seashores, by the side of reservoirs, and the like. The Kankali shrine boasted an impressive reservoir on its side, which was said to have been built by King Shiva Singh in the 12th century for his daughter Ishwari Singh. Locals called it the Ishra Pond.
A gaunt bearded fellow, the main priest of the temple, Ram Chandra Das, showed us around the temple site. “Mysteriously, time and again, Goddess Kankali Mai switches her abode to far removed places such as Patna, as Patandevi, to Kolkata as Kali, or Betia, all cities in India’s Bengal and Bihar state,” he said, also shedding light on the myths and legends associated with the deity.
Reservoir at Kankali shrine
The main temple, a nagara (curvilinear) architecture, housed a three-foot-tall black polished idol of Goddess Kankali Mai—an avatar of Kali, the Hindu goddess of enlightenment and liberation. Curiously, it bore an uncanny resemblance to the idol of Gadhidai we saw earlier at Bariyarpur.
Previously known as Kangankali for the Goddess’s fetish for kangans (bangles), the idol heavily draped in a red shawl and adorned with shiny golden motif, carried the same height and build of Gadhimai.
The idol stood under the extended hood of the mythological Shesh Nag, the thousand-headed cobra. According to Hindu mythology, the Shesh Nag symbolises ‘eternity’ and holds the entire universe on its head. The most striking likeness between the idol at Gadhimai and the Kankali Mai was the large protruding eyes cast in silver.
Only the saffron cloth that draped the Shesh Nag seemed to distinguish them apart. Our guide told us that Gadhimai was an incarnation or avatar of none other than the Kankali Mai.

Next to the shrine stood a 700-year-old domed building with a steeple. Its inner sanctum housed the samadhi (tomb) of Mansha Baba, a revered baba, or saint, who was said to have miraculously entered the earth by his divine powers to breathe his last peacefully.

History
Recalling Nepal’s medieval history, Simraungadh was the capital city of Mithila kingdom (also called Tirhut) in 1097 AD. The Mithila region was bounded by the Mahananda River on the east, the Gandaki on the west, the Ganges on the south and the Himalayas on the north, spreading over half of present-day Bihar State, India. Mithila finds its mention in the sacred Hindu epic Ramayana by Valmiki, too.
The Karnataor Samaroon dynasty was founded by the King of Bengal, Nanyadev in the 11th century. He first ruled Mithila. His successors reigned over Mithila for more than two centuries. The regime ended with the 5th successor, Harisimha Deva (1295-1324 CE) following an invasion of Mithila by the Mughal warrior Ghias-Ud-din Mohammad Bin Tughlak in 1324-25.
Simraungadh was razed to the ground following the siege. King Harsimha Dev and his family fled north into the hills and remained in hiding. Then, with his entourage, he left for Dolakha but died on the way at a place called Tinpata in Sindhuli. There are no two opinions about Harisimha Dev’s flight. Both Nepal and Mithila vaṃśāvalis (genealogies) support it.
However, speculations run high over Harisimha Dev’s post-flight period, and it is the issue much debated amid historians. Some claim King Harisimha Deva, under a refugee status, entered the Nepal Valley (also called Nepal Mandala—Bhadgaon, Kantipur and Lalitpur) around the beginning of the 14th century. Others maintain that he even ruled the Nepal Valley.
The inscription erected at Hanumandhoka by King Pratap Malla (1641-1674 AD) illustrates how Harisimha Dev came to Ashmanagar (Panauti), and then to Nepal Valley. A similar account by Pratap Malla is also to be found at the Pashupatinath inscription. History pages also mention that the Tulaja Bhawani deity was brought to Nepal Valley by Harisimha Dev from Simraungadh. The Malla Kings came to adopt and revere it as their tutelary deity.

Ranibas
Our last visit included the Ranibas, the residence (bas) of the queen (rani).The palace was built by the Karnata King Shiva Singh in the 12th century for his daughter Queen Isri Devi. The site later came to be converted into a Ram-Janaki Hindu shrine.
Ram Mandir
History records that in the 1850s (AD), Prime Minister Jung Bahadur’s son General Jit Jung Rana built the temple in memory of his father. Flanked by thick brush, the narrow path that led to the temple opened on to a wide forecourt with a huge gnarled kabhro tree (a kind of fig tree that bears wild fruit used for making pickle). A mango orchard lay next to it.
A flight of steps led to the entrance of a square, two-storied tin-roofed brick structure—said to be the living quarters that surrounded the temple premises. Closely similar to the Kankali temple but much larger and imposing, the two-storied structure was painted in vibrant colors and stood high on a raised platform.
Falling wall of Ram Mandir quarters
The interior of the temple housed idols of Ram, Sita, and Laxman, three of the mythical gods from the Hindu Ramayana epic. They all sat in a row, while statues of Jung Bahadur Rana, his wife, and son Gen. Jagat Jung, knelt before them with folded hands.
Statues of Ram, Laxman and Sita
Two large metallic bells, said to have been added to the shrine by Jagat Jung, bore inscriptions dated BS 1933 (1876 AD). In the foreground of the temple, a big statue of Hanuman, the Hindu monkey God from Ramayana, sat on a raised pedestal. “The shrine attracts a capacity crowd of worshippers every year on the day of Ram Navami (birthday of Lord Ram),” informed a local guy.
The courtyard held an ancient well. Stone relics lay in some disarray at a corner of the courtyard. The living quarters for pilgrims girdling the temple appeared in a pitiably run-down state with the walls falling apart. It was clear the premises were sorely neglected.

A pond, said to belong to the olden days, was located on the western periphery of the temple. “The Ranibas used to boast 208 wells and as many lotus ponds, but most are buried, some dried up, and only a handful remains now,” said Anirudra Mishra, a priest at the shrine.

Buried Kingdom
We tried in Simraungadh to locate some ruins that bore the barest testimony to its glorious past. Save for some relics at Ranibas, the locals, however, failed to point even to stray old lumps of bricks that once belonged to the last king’s palace or that fortified the high walls of the old city.
Relics at Ram Mandir
It looked nothing remained, which evoked some faint images of the erstwhile Kingdom.  A local fellow, however, told us that if dug up no deeper than a few feet any place around the 28 sq-km area of the old city, it would fetch medieval-era artifacts and earthen pots. Nay even gold and silver!
Legends, myths, and history spoke loud and clear about Simraungadh’s vibrant past. But on completion of our tour, it was hard to believe that the dusty and dreary little town revelled once as the capital city of a booming medieval kingdom ruled by a sagacious Karnata King. As it stands, the kingdom lies buried into the bowels of the earth.

As over 170 cyclists rode to Janakpur from Kathmandu during the 4th edition of the annual Ride Through Sindhuligadhi event last weekend, three kids caught everyone’s eye.
Shubham Shrestha, Suyog Man Basnyat and Aditya Shrestha are just eight, 10 and 13 respectively; but they were all prepared to cycle the 250-kilometre journey to Janakpur via Sindhuligadi.  All three of them seemed to push each other one peddle at a time along with dozens of adults on the way. While Aditya and Shubham skipped a part of the climb to Sindhugadhi from Mulkot, Suyog along with his father Yogendra Man Singh Basnyat completed the entire route on his bicycle.
Many were surprised seeing their stamina. “What these kids are doing is remarkable. Riding with adults along the dangerous tarmac road is quite inspiring. Not only have they pushed each other, but they have also inspired other riders who had self-doubt,” shares Sudip Poudel, the ride leader of the event.
The boys were not only inspirations but were also the stars of the show. From local villagers to fellow riders, everyone wanted a selfie with the trio whenever they stopped for water breaks. They were celebrities for three days.
Suyog and Shubham giving an interview.
All three boys picked up cycling from a young age. The fathers of all three, who are also cyclists, over the course of a few years groomed these kids’ passion for cycling.
“Suyog started when he was three, but he began participating in these rallies when he was six. He’s always showed a desire towards cycling. As I ride, he wanted to do the same and I don’t see any harm in him doing this. He enjoys cycling and its challenges and I like to see him overcome these challenges,” shares Yogendra, his father.
The same was the case with Aditya, whose father Deepak Shrestha facilitated his son’s passion for cycling.
“I like him riding his bike and being a part of these events. I feel it gives many people the urge to do the same. He is passionate about it and also enjoys doing this. I hope his love and enthusiasm for cycling never dies,” says Deepak, adding he brought his son Aditya after watching Suyog cycling nearly the entire length of the ride last year.
“I enjoy riding. It makes me feel good. I don’t do enough of these long tours but when I get the chance, I enjoy it quite a bit. Sometimes my father does not let me ride the entire length of these tours, but it’s still fun cycling up to whatever point I can,” adds Aditya.
Shubham rides with fellow riders
Shubham too has the same enthusiasm on his face. He rides a bicycle which is clearly for the kids older than him but still, he rides with ease. While peddling, he has to stand up and after he gathers some momentum, he sits down. From a small town of Udayapur, he had come to Kathmandu with his father and his uncle to ride to Janakpur. But due to some problems, his father had to return leaving the eight-year-old with his uncle
His father Chiran shares that Shubham, like Aditya and Suyog, started riding from six.
“We take him on rides regularly in Udayapur. He enjoys it. He loves his bicycle. His technique is quite different but he seems to be comfortable with it. We take him out every Saturday and whenever events like this happen. He’s been the start of the show this year. I hope he can make it here again the next year.”
When asked if he was afraid while riding on the road from Kathmandu to Janakpur, young Shubham says he rather enjoyed it. He shares that he liked the attention he received from others. But he did get a bit angry when asked to take the bus from Khurkot to Sindhuligadhi. Sitting on the bus, he kept on posing the same question, “Why did they put me here? I want to be out there.”
“We took the decision because he’s too young and the uphill is too long. Maybe in a few years’ time, he can do the complete ride,” explains Poudel.
Aditya checking if the breaks of his bikes are working properly
But them being on the trip is enough to motivate cyclists. Rabit Maharjan, an adult participant of the event, shares that watching Suyog climb up the uphill to Sindhuligadhi gave him the motivation to ride on. The same was the case for McDara O’Shea from Ireland. O’Shea, who is embarking on a cycling journey from London to Singapore, shares that all three kids gave him added motivation.
“They are brilliant. You see people watching these kids and admiring their guts and determination. I feel quite privileged to have ridden with these young boys. I hope they carry on cycling,” he adds.
When asked if they will do the ride again, the boys say that they would love to, however, their parents say that only time will tell what happens next.
The orgasiners also feel that the participation of these young boys is important in the longer run. “Last year, we only had Suyog. This year, we had Aditya and Shubham. People have promised us that they too will bring their kids along this ride, which means that these kids are doing something really great,” explains Poudel.",/travel,"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 05:01:58 +0000"

The river, which originates near the Tibetan plateau, is rich in resources, yet people living on its banks are poor and marginalised; the river nourishes life on its banks, but it also wreaks havoc from time to time.
The Mahakali bridge joins Chandani and Dodhara villages west of the river to the rest of Nepal.
The Mahakali bridge, which connects Chandani and Dodhara villages to the rest of Nepal is also full of contradictions. While sand and pebbles mined on the banks of the river are used to build concrete bridges elsewhere, the bridge here is made of metal.

 
 

 
Sand and pebble miners returning to Nepali land.
The Mahakali gushes through the slopes of western Nepal carrying debris and sand with it. The sand is mined and transported to the market. The contradiction here is that while the sand provides much-needed life-saving money for the local community, unscientific mining has increased the risk of life-threatening floods. In addition to that, destructive fishing practices such as poisoning and electrocution of fish in the river are also taking a toll on local livelihood.
 
Women groups in the lower reaches of the Mahakali are taking the lead in local conservations.

With most of the men in the area leaving their homes in search of work in India and beyond, it is now up to the local women to take up the challenge to deal with the contradictions of the Mahakali. With support from Oxfam’s Transboundary Rivers of South Asia (TROSA), they have formed women’s groups to lobby for policy changes to conserve the river and its resources.
Women’s groups meet regularly to discuss various local issues.
While the groups are just starting out, their work looks promising. Some of the groups have set up fish conservation areas where destructive fishing has been banned. The groups hold regular discussions with local representatives of their municipalities to discuss ways to conserve the river.

The Mahakali river has changed a lot; some of the changes may be irreversible. But there is a hope that the local communities will take the lead to save it.",/travel,"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 06:26:32 +0000"

The place was our main destination where Harman, Ranjan and I had planned to spend two days. However, Pun’s disrespectful behaviour towards us, and towards all Nepalis in general, put us off.
That one day nearly overshadowed our entire trip, but overall it was tiresome and memorable. We walked through some dense forests, up and down some steep hills and got to view the majesty of the mountains.
For someone as lazy as I am, I nearly walked 50 kilometres in five days which is something I had never done even on flatlands.
Even though I didn’t meet as many people as I would’ve liked on the trail, walking to Khopra is possibly one of the best treks I’ve done in my life, one that has taught me that you can walk as much as you can while you’re out in the wild.
Day 1
Machhapuchre seen from Ghandruk
Kathmandu to Ghandruk
I had never imagined hopping on a non-ac night bus to Pokhara from Kathmandu would be as tiring as it was. After failing to book tickets for other better buses, we had to board the one, humid, stinky and full of people. By the time we got to Pokhara at 5 am, we were shattered. However, getting to Pokhara was only the first part of our trip. We still had to get to Ghandruk, from where we had planned to start our week-long trek to Khopra Danda and back.
As soon as the local bus to Ghandruk started to move, I felt that the plan to save time by taking a night bus to Pokhara was a bad idea. My knees were cramped for room and the awful roads didn’t help my cause either. It was five hours of hell before we reached Kimche, from where our hour-long hike to Ghandruk started. I never thought that walking would be better than the bus ride. The weather at Ghandrunk wasn’t great, but still, the air was fresh and the people were lovely. Our trek had officially begun.

Day 2
Ghandruk to Isharu
After a comfortable stay at the Old Village Inn, we were on our way to Dobato. I didn’t want to walk as much as the boys insisted and this was going to be a long day as maps.me showed that Dobato was nearly 12 km away.
A view seen between Ghandruk and Tadapani
The initial walk to Tadapani was quite easy. You go downhill from Ghandruk for around 30 minutes, after which the trail starts to get uphill. I was told that the trail during the spring would have a lot of rhododendrons; however, I also came across a lot of monkeys on the trail.
Forests like these are a common sight on the trail.
The trail from Tadapani onwards was quite poor. It’s probably the worst trail I’d ever walked. It’s muddy, and not marked well. It is mostly uphill, especially up to a small resting spot called Meshar. The trail after that got a bit better, but still muddy. What made it worse was constant drizzling and misty weather. Had it been sunny, I guess I’d have enjoyed it more but when we came to a small village called Isharu, I couldn’t walk any longer. My mates decided Dobato was a long shot watching my state and decided to call it a day. Thank god!
Isharu wasn’t the best of place on the trail but surrounded by hills, it was quite nice. If you concentrated, you could see Pokhara and the Phewa Lake in the distance. The view made me regret staying there as the view from Dobato would have obviously been better, but the mushroom curry and rice wine we got there made up for most of it. As we were the only three people at the lodge, we were also given a lot of blankets.
Day 3
Isharu to Dhan Kharka
The day didn’t start as planned. We woke up late which no mountain view and it also meant that the day would end late. We had to walk another 10kms which didn’t go down well with me. But without being fussy, I was on my way.
Walking these narrow trails, we reached Dobato.
The initial walk up to Dobato was not hard. It took time, but the trail was quite nice. We even saw glimpses of Annapurna South behind the clouds. The trail was a bit narrow but I was not as bad the one up to Meshar. We reached Dobato relatively quickly, however, we did not get to see the view.
After a quick tea, we then started the walk up to Bayeli Kharka. This was probably the best part of this trail. It was mostly flat as you had to walk through some pretty narrow ridges. It was fun and it wasn’t hard. The cool breeze kept on reminding you that you were close to the mountains. There was no one on the trail, which felt great. I was walking alone looking at birds flying, bees taking nectar from flowers and hills far away basking in the sunlight. It was probably my best walk during the entire trip.
 
But that happiness suddenly disappeared. After lunch at Bayeli, the gruelling downhill walk started. What was better was the trail. We walked on a wideish path along the forest and met a few sheepherders. But soon, the trail got worse as the jungle kept getting denser and the trail to Dhan Kharka got narrower and worse.
The trail kept on going up and downhill crossing waterfalls after which narrow uphills began. What made it irritating was lack of trail marks, which was why I had to look for boot and trekking pole marks to ensure I was going on the right path. Add leeches to the trail and now you have a walk which will surely creep a lot of trekkers.

When I saw Dhan Kharka from afar, my happiness was beyond everything. I had made it. My mates had reached the place an hour earlier and were quite worried if I was lost. They were just as happy to see me as I was happy to see Dhan Kharka.
Our plan was to go to Khopra, but due to congestion, we were advised to stay at Dhan Kharkha also known as Chistibung. The lodge owners there were quite nice and always smiling but the food was crap. I don’t think I’ve ever eaten such disgusting food. However, their hospitality made up for the food. After chatting with the lodge owners sitting in the kitchen, we called it a night.
Day 4
Dhan Kharka to Khopra and back
Whenever I recall that day, all I want to do is punch Chitra Pun. Ranjan wanted to go to Khayer Lake so we started at 6 am. He was up there before 8 am followed by me who reached there around 8:30. But Harman was nowhere to be seen. He had overtaken me as soon as we started climbing but he hadn’t reached the top. We were worried. “Surely he lost his way,” said Ranjan. But there wasn’t anywhere to get lost. The trail was quite bad but it was relatively easy as it was mostly uphill for nearly 90 minutes, after which it got quite flat.
Trail to Khopra Danda
After waiting for two hours, we were thinking of heading down but then Harman arrived. He told us that he got lost on the way while trying a shortcut. We were extremely relieved. But he was disappointed that we were not allowed to stay there.
However, before we got back, Pun said, “No hard feelings. It’s just the way it is.” He told us that they could not give rooms to the domestic tourists as they spend less and make more noises.

Disappointed by his attitude, we went back to Dhan Kharka, where Harman said we should stay an extra day. As I’d walked more in two days than I had in the past two months, I didn’t complain as I could rest for a day. We stayed at Dhan Kharka, drinking and talking to fellow trekkers who too had been denied a place at Khopra. None of us liked Chitra Pun. We met a boy who’d come from Ghorepani who had heard about Pun’s antics as well. “The lodge manager at Ghorepani told me that Pun is an ass. Your stories prove that,” he told us as we looked at the stars on a clear night sky.
I swear I had never seen so many stars. It just made that day in Dhan Kharka even better.

Day 5
Dhan Kharka to Ghorepani
Another 10-km day! So we started early. We were told that the trail wasn’t hard; that was a relief. I and Ranjan headed towards Ghorepani while Harman went towards Khopra. He was going to have a long day.
The first stretch from Dhan Kharka to Swanta was easy. Some uphill, but it was mostly easy downhill until you reached a hydropower project site, surrounded by marijuana plants. The trail then moved through a jungle with a narrow path that had nettle plants on both sides. Some said the walk was scary but I thought it was calm, walking through the jungle. In no time, we reached Swanta where I and Ranjan settled down for our first proper meal since Ghandruk.

After a proper chicken dinner, we started our walk towards Ghorepani. The locals told us the walk was easy but we didn’t find it easy. Walking through more narrow paths through jungles, we reached Chitre after which the gruelling walk towards Ghorepani began. I could see the place from a distance but it was always that bit further. Gasping for breath slowly, I eventually reached the place and we picked a hotel and called it a day.
The first thing both of us did was a hot shower after nearly a week. Then, we waited for Harman whose last message had come from Swanta.
After waiting for nearly four hours, Harman arrived. He looked exhausted. But he also looked relieved when he saw us. As soon as he came, so did the rain and that came as a relief as walking such an uphill in the rain would be a mammoth task even for him.
Thundershower meant the place also didn’t have lights so we called it an early night as we’d thought we might have gone to Poon Hill the next day.
Day 6
Walking through misty forests
Ghorepani to Ulleri
The next morning Ranjan called us out asking if we were going to Poon hill. But none of us were bothered. We’d been to Khopra which had similar views and Poon Hill could be done another time. We had a good night’s sleep and headed towards Ulleri from where we hoped to get on a jeep.
The trail to Ulleri was all downhill. It was quite easy. I’d call it the easiest day. After four days of walking such ridiculous trails, this one I felt was a piece of cake.
It took us three hours to get to Ulleri, where we had to bargain for a jeep which took Rs 1,000 to Nayapul. We had no choice so gave him that. From Nayapul, we found a jeep to Pokhara, where were spent the night before coming back to Kathmandu.

Alex Bescoby is an award-winning British filmmaker and TV presenter based in Yangon, Myanmar. He studied politics and history at Cambridge University and has spent much of the last decade working, exploring and living in Southeast Asia. Bescoby has a passion for Land Rovers stretching back to childhood, having long idolised The First Overland Expedition. The First Overland – made history in 1955 by being the first to drive from London to Singapore. That young team inspired generations of adventurers through their extraordinary endeavour, showing many remote corners of the world on film for the first time.
Driving the original 1955 Series One Land Rover (‘Oxford’), Bescoby and an experienced team are remaking history for a new generation of adventurers. This time, the team will forge the path through some of the densest jungles, highest mountains and most arid deserts on the planet, returning the car from Singapore to London.
Currently, Bescoby is in Nepal part of the Last Overland expedition where he along with his team are driving from Singapore to London on a 64-year-old Land Rover. Onlinekhabar caught up with Bescoby and talked to him about his journey so far and what he aims to achieve through this extraordinary journey. Excerpts:
How has the journey been so far? 
It’s been amazing. I had pretty high expectations when they approached me and I have not been let down at all. It feels I’ve been doing this forever now and it’s a wonderful life. I have a wonderful team. We get up every day, meet new people, and see new places where we’ve never been to before. We also get to learn so many things every day. We eat fantastic food and often bump into landrover lovers who come out to see and speak to us just to see the car.
It has been tiring moving all the time, but it’s been a wonderful experience so far. There’s been a lot of variety so far. Roads have been good in most places but we’ve also had some really poor roads but all in all, I’d say it’s been fun.
Where have you been so far? 
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Northeast India and now Nepal. And what’s wonderful is that the way we’re travelling we’re learning new things about cross-border cultures. When you fly into a place you assume that the geographical borders are where the cultures stop. But you realise that when you cross from Thailand to Myanmar, a lot of people there speak the same language, share the same faith. Same with travelling through northeast India, we’ve seen six or seven major ethnic groups which are similar to northwest Myanmar. The past few days, we spent with people speaking Nepali and identifying themselves as Gurkhas in northeast India. That is what I’ve been finding very fascinating. When you travel by road slowly, how the different national cultures they sort of mix and blend with each other.
How long have you been on the road? 
It is a long way. We’ve been on the road for 36 days now and still have around two-and-a-half months to go. It turns out flying is a lot easier than driving from Singapore to London.
So you’re not rushing then? 
What would be the point in that? We’re not racing against anyone. We’re in an old car and want to enjoy this journey. We also want to see these incredible places and learn about new cultures because you never know when we’ll be able to travel to these places.  It would be a real shame to just drive through these wonderful places.

When do you plan to be back in London? 
Our deadline is Christmas. I think we are on track.
What was the first thing that came across your mind when you were asked to go on this journey? 
It was the opportunity of a lifetime. The pieces started to fall for the project when I started to get excited. Tim Slessor wanted to do it. The old car was available and restored. We had sponsors like the Singapore Tourism Board and Land Rover came in and told us they’d make it possible. That is when I felt this was going to be an adventure of a lifetime and I haven’t been disappointed.
How is the car? 
It’s good. Oxford is 64 years old. She has no power steering, no disk brake, no air conditioning, very very poor windscreen wipers which I have realised in the past few days. And she leaks through the roof and she’s drafty. But by god, she is fun to drive. I call her ‘she’ because Tim always called her ‘she’. He called this car the old lady.
I feel this car has a personality that you get to know gradually and that’s wonderful because this isn’t a normal car. You’re not protected from the environment. You feel the road, you feel the weather, it’s noisy and it’s hard work because you have to concentrate. It makes the journey more fun I’d say.

What advice did Tim give you before starting the journey? 
It was nice of him to come to Singapore with us. The initial plan was for him to come with us, but his health got bad so he didn’t join us. But in the build-up to that, Tim gave me some practical advice which has come in handy so far into the journey. From how to pack the cars, to how to approach scheduling and resting, how to eat how to drink. But I remember two pieces of advice the most: one was to drive fast on bumpy roads or else oxford will rattle into pieces and the other one was whatever disagreement we’d have as a team, he told us to make sure it didn’t last the day.

 What has each country taught you so far?
Well, Singapore taught me how much you can get done in 24 hours. That city is incredible. Anything you want to get done in 24 hours you can do. In Malaysia, I learned how much those people loved Land Rovers. I was absolutely blown away. In Thailand, I learned to appreciate good roads, 7/11s, good petrol stations and great food. Myanmar, where I’ve lived for many years, taught me the value of air conditioning. It was absolutely boiling there.
Northeast India blew my mind. It taught me how little I knew about India and the variety of culture and history there. Even the terrain was quite surprising. And here in Nepal nothing yet. I’ve just been here and I hope I get to learn a lot from this country too. The welcome has been amazing. We’ve been looked after by the Gurkha Welfare Trust who have been simply amazing.
Where will you be travelling around Nepal? 
Well, from Damak, we’re going to Pokhara where we’ll spend a few days. We’ll take the car to Sarangkot. After that, we’ll go to Kathmandu where we’ll prepare for our trip to China which is going to be quite tough. We’re exiting via Kerung into China which is going to be hard work. Travelling through some remote places in China, going through some of the highest roads in the world, we want to relax in Kathmandu and immerse ourselves in the festival. Looking forward to having a good time in Nepal.
What’s been your biggest challenge so far? 
I’d say the car. Just keeping the car in good condition has been a challenge. It’s been challenging to drive especially on the Indian highways where people drive on the wrong side of the road. Making sure the car is okay has been a challenge. We broke down in Darjeeling where there were a lot of Land Rover mechanics which was a lot of help. Bad roads have also been a challenge.

Has the journey been better than what you’d hoped it would be? 
Absolutely. I hadn’t expected such a good response. I had thought that we would be driving through countries and no one would care. But that has not been the case. Both the response the road and where we’re stopped has been staggering. People have given us free meals and free hotels, something which I had not imagined we would be getting. The response online has been quite amazing. Both on Facebook and Instagram.
When Tim fell ill we thought people would not be interested in our journey but we were wrong. People have absolutely loved what we’re doing so far. What we’ve realised is that the car is much a celebrity as Tim.
The route
What do you plan to achieve through this? Is this doing it for doing its sake or is there a greater calling? 
I mean there is this doing it for doing its sake in a way because the journey that Tim went on to define his life. And 64 years later, he and his friends are still talking about it.
Then another question arose – can we do it? Will the car make it? Politically can we get across borders without much trouble? We also wanted to see if the world was more dangerous than it was 64 years ago or is it safer?
Personally I wanted to investigate what had changed in the world in the past 64 years.
There are obviously bad things going around in the world, but I want to show people that on the ground level people are lovely. And I hope I inspire other people to travel slowly across countries and hope they realise that the world is a better place.
The First Overland came via Afghanistan and Syria, but you’re not taking that route. The world was more interconnected in the past, but can’t move as freely now. Comments?
We could try going through Afghanistan and Syria, but it would be stupid. We don’t want to take so many risks. What interesting about this route we’re taking now is we’ve moving freely across China and Central Asia, something the 1955 team could never do. There is no way that six Britons could drive through China and the USSR without conflicts. Just shows how the world has changed.

66,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/angling-the-water-tigers-a-breakthrough-in-adventure-tourism.html,"“There he stood, the Mahseer of the Poonch, beside whom the Tarpon is a herring and he who catches him can say he is a fisherman.” Rudyard Kipling (Jungle Book, 1894).
Virtually, cut off from the rest of the world until the 1950s, Nepal saw the dawn of tourism after an intrepid duo set foot on this little “mythological Shangri-La” to scale the Everest. That venturous duo were Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary. At 11:30 am on May 29, 1953, the Everest was conquered . . . and world history was rewritten.
The historic event catapulted our little known country to global fame. Adventure tourism, thus, saw its birth in Nepal. With time, it diversified. After the top-draw adventure attraction of mountaineering, came trekking, followed by wildlife safari and white water rafting. Human’s hunger for more adventure, however, would not let up.
Braver diversions
Old concepts turned passé. To woo more tourists, newer concepts like ‘eco tours’, ‘green tours,’ ‘cultural tours,’ ‘soft tours,’ ‘adventure tours’ and the like heralded a revamping of the travel notion.
Soon followed braver diversions, the likes of rock climbing, canyoning, paragliding, hot air ballooning, mountain biking, bungee jumping, skydiving, zip flying—and still counting! Ski-mountaineering and ski-diving? You heard it right.  That’s another adventure notion the travel operators have tweaked into their itinerary.
Worldwide sport
Surprisingly, angling or fishing tours in Nepal still seems almost an uncharted domain, less explored and waiting to be tapped. Neighbouring India, on the other hand, has made quite a leap into this field.

Sportfishing in India has flourished substantially in the last two decades and almost every travel operator includes angling trips in their holiday itineraries. This adventure sport lures worldwide anglers to India in pursuit of the legendary Golden mahseer (tor putitora), the ultimate dream fish of every serious freshwater angler.
The popular angling destinations in India include the upper Ganges with her many tributaries in North India like the Ram Ganga (flows through the Corbett National Park), Saryu and Kali at Pancheswor, Uttarakhand, for the golden mahseer, and the river Cauvery rising in the mountainous region of Coorg in the Western Ghats in the Karnataka state, for the monster-size hump-backed mahseer.

Dedicated anglers from around the world spend fortunes to travel thousands of miles to India in pursuit of this charismatic game fish. Tours are typically booked up to a year in advance through travel agents or online.
Considering its endangered status, the Indian government has passed strict directives to release all such mahseer catches. You catch it, then gingerly hold it in your arms, weigh it, measure it, strike a pose with it for a photo, and finally release it gently back into the waters where it belongs.
Over the past few decades, the trend of tourism in Nepal has gone through a dramatic diversification, with adventure tourism taking an edge over others. Some years ago, a news item headlined “Nat Geo hails thrill-seekers’ paradise” pointed out that National Geographic identified Nepal and Brazil among the top-draw adventure destinations in the world.
This came as welcome news. Given proper promotion, angling for mahseer in our torrential snow-fed rivers tucked into the foothills of the exotic Himalayas guarantees the visitors newer horizons of virgin wilderness, adventure, and truly a fantastic angling itinerary.

In recent years, a handful of Nepali travel operators have included fishing in their itinerary.  Such trips are, however, a far cry from the organised fishing carried out by many outfitters in neighbouring India.

Owing to lack of professionalism, inadequate data and research on the aquatic life, and insufficient expertise and handling experience to back such ventures, the potential of running fishing expeditions as a full-fledge adventure destination has not been fully tapped in Nepal. More than that, for the past few decades, the legendary mahseer has had a trying time caused by human encroachment and depletion of natural resources.
Threatened    
The 2018 Living Planet Report, published every two years documented an alarming 60 per cent decline in the population of wildlife on earth, both terrestrial and aquatic. Depletion of natural biodiversity, on the other hand, threatens the planet to its brim. Human encroachment and the atrocity against wildlife on the face of the earth did not spare Nepal, too.
And today’s buzz-words ‘global warming’ and the ‘greenhouse’ gas emissions have kept the scientists on the edge of their seats since the turn of the 20th century.
Considered a national heritage by ichthyologists, the status of mahseers in Nepal is far from satisfactory. In truth, they are heavily threatened and fall under the IUCN Red List.  The causes for this are not far to seek.
Unethical killing
Yes, in the past few decades, the ‘popular’ but grossly unethical methods of fishing have only worsened to assume alarming proportions. The mahseer has fallen victim to blast-fishing, poisoning, electrofishing, and fishing during the spawning season. Rampant gill-netting with no regard for the size of the mesh (decimating mother and fingerlings both) has become a ‘joyriding’ epidemic. And to make a quick buck, people go to any length.
Doomed! Electrofishing (I’d to take this photo on the sly)
During one of my fishing trips to the Tama Koshi River, some 18 km from Dolakha, Charikot, I witnessed a scene that made my blood run cold. On seeing some commotion, curious, I approached the noisy group of locals gathered at the riverbank. Never thought people could stoop so low.
To my horror, they had a live wire strung from the high-voltage transmission line, which they shoved into the water to electrocute the fish. What nerve! Why on earth did they not realise that it was too dangerous and not only kill the fish indiscriminately but take their lives too?
Massive encroachment
“The mahseer is essentially a fish of the rocks, the rapids, and the hills,” wrote A. St. J. Macdonald in his epic book, Circumventing the Mahseer, published in 1948. No words could be truer about the Himalayan gamefish. The more untamed the river, the better is the mahseer run. They hunt and thrive in rough but clear waters with lots of gravel. Silted water proves as their worse nemesis.
What with the country’s infrastructure work at its height from construction of roads, dams to barrages and irrigation weirs, massive quarrying of rocks, gravel and sand from the river bed to natural calamities like landslides (associated with deforestation), all led to the destruction of its natural habitat and disrupted its annual migratory cycle, which is so critical for natural reproduction.
That said, as loss of biodiversity and rapid depletion of natural resources continue, lack of awareness among the riverside fishing community and total government apathy to address the problem, on the other, pose disastrous outcomes for the mahseer and other aquatic species still fighting for survival.
Freshwater monsters
Along with the mahseer, other gamefish like the river monster Goonch catfish (Bagarius yarelli), which have been known to  grow to more than nine feet weighing up to a whopping 50 to 150 kilos, and the snow trout, Asla (Schizothorax macrophthalmus), too, are under threat of extinction if the problem is not timely addressed. The goonch is regarded as a formidable quarry by anglers while fly-fishing for Himalayan snow-trout, a great sport.

The monster-size goonch has a notorious reputation of dragging fishermen into the river and eating them. Jeremy Wade, the British angler, biologist, and writer—better-known as the TV presenter of the wildlife documentary—the River Monsters—toured the world in pursuit of the giant catfish and fished our Mahakali waters in west Nepal, too.
Catch-n-release
Apart from the implementation of conservation measures, awareness among the modern-day anglers and the riverside fishing fraternity is equally important and can effectively work as a stepping stone in saving the aquatic life of our rivers from extinction.
Golden Mahseer
Little-known some two decades ago, catch-and-release among the old-hands and the budding mahseer anglers in Nepal in recent years, have shown some promise for this endangered species. Many Nepali and the visiting foreign anglers to our rivers in Nepal have started releasing their prize-catches.
This conscientious act by the anglers has to some extent sparked off a little curiosity among the local fishing community about the significance of conserving the aquatic life of their rivers. Simple curiosity is followed by an interaction with the anglers and that eventually helps shed light on the fish’s vulnerability and the threatened status to the local people.
Great potential
Given meticulous planning and customised escorted destinations, mahseer angling, as an adventure travel destination in Nepal, can surely make a major breakthrough in travel trade business. Other tour packages like wildlife safari, white water rafting, nature trekking, and bird watching can be mutually supportive, and impart further impetus to such ventures.

“Sport fishing could go a long way in conserving these fish. Anglers not only pay top dollar to land the Mahseer, which has become a legend among anglers, but will also create jobs for the poor. No doubt that protecting stretches of rivers like this is the answer. But the government must be willing,” writes an angler-conservationist, Arun Rana, for Fishing Himalayas, a website dedicated to responsible sport fishing in Nepal.

In recent years, the entry made by fly-fishing mahseer in our waters has gained growing popularity. Fishing golden mahseer on the fly is considered by anglers a bigger challenge than fishing with the conventional tackle, but believe it can match the catch ratio of the latter, no less.

First, a careful study and survey of potential mahseer waters, evaluation of the present status of our watercourses and their resident mahseer runs and informed selection of river stretches least affected by human proximity and poaching are essential.
Emulating the neighbours

Following in the footsteps of our Indian cousins, all angling operations can be managed either from fixed station riverside camps or lodges or by mounting short or long expeditions by river rafting combined with short hikes. Some guidelines to consider:
•Conduct angling trips on a day-by-day basis from established camps or lodges, located near the fishing waters. In Bardiya National Park, several resorts can work as established bases from which to fish the Karnali, Babai, Bheri and Seti rivers. The roadside town of Chisapani can also serve as a base for fishing the upper Karnali and confluences like the Karnali-Bheri and Karnali-Seti.
•Organise expeditions or customised trips with local river guides or river scouts by raft or short treks. Given proper planning, our rivers offer plenty of opportunities, both by raft or short hikes. Many rafting companies can accommodate such a schedule.
Some options are: Dolalghat/Chatara Ghat river rafting with a myriad of tributaries feeding themselves into the Sunkoshi river in the central Nepal hills or short hikes from Mulghat in east Nepal’s Dhankuta district to Tribeni along the river Tamor, or from Maibeni in east Nepal’s Bhojpur district to the confluence of the Pikhuwa and Arun rivers, or from west Nepal’s Bheri-Karnali confluence to Chisapani.
• Combine fishing packages (if close to a national park) diversified by other activities such as nature walks, elephant safaris, birdwatching, village tours, canoe rides, and the lot.

We cannot expect to develop this adventure sport unless we develop in-depth guidelines and a strategy that combines both ‘transplantation and conservation’ to revive these threatened species. It’s high time the concerned authorities took some bold and innovative strategy to save this species from being shoved into oblivion.
Nature at its best
For every visiting angler in pursuit of the awe-inspiring mahseer, there is more to it—not just the fish. The foray kicks off with the sprawling countryside, and from one moment to the next, nature accompanies him with all its bounty.
As a myriad of undulating wooded hills and awesome gorges appears, the rivers rage and crash past breaking into hundreds of churning white rapids and beautiful falls. The visitor is stumped.
As he finds himself smack dab in lush green mountain valleys, the gin-clear spring-fed headwaters meander past him to continue through the verdant subtropical jungles to pour themselves into their big cousins.
Time and again, the remote outback offers incredible sights of wildlife and sounds of nature that greet the untrained ear. Many a village crosses the trail, offering rare moments to share with the local people and observe their unique customs, beliefs and diverse ethnic culture.

And finally, as he casts his line over the swirling water, the master fisherman, the Kingfisher, suddenly swoops down into a blinding flash, spears its tiny prey and flies off. Next, his heart skips a beat as a mugger crocodile breaks the surface to laze on the sandy beach.
And before he knows it, he gawks unbelievingly at a handsome Cheetal stag that approaches the other side of the river for a drink. Sheer bliss!
And all this time the ultimate quest for that elusive “Big One”—“the Mighty Mahseer” of his dream haunts his mind.  Save the Mahseer! Tight lines!

Smashed rods, mangled hooks, broken lines and shattered reels are not uncommon, particularly if the angler fails to handle the big mahseer that decides to dash for the nearest rapid. And you are just left wondering how the hell that happened! An angler once equated grappling the big ‘beast’ with a 10-round bout with no less a boxer than Mike Tyson!  
Let’s leaf through the pages of a history book and drift way back to the 1850s, when the British ruled India. The British Raj (1858–1947), they called it. Nobody during those early years of the Raj ever imagined that a fish called the mahseer (mahi- fish and sher- tiger or “tiger among fish” in Persian) would eventually rewrite history.
In 1873, an Englishman, Henry Sullivan Thomas, wrote the book called The Rod in India that dwelled on the natural history of fish, their culture and fishing for mahseer in India. The book became a Bible for the anglers across the globe. In 1948, the book titled Circumventing the Mahseer by Major A. St. J. Macdonald hit the shelves. And it became a ‘Classic.’

History re-written
The more I studied about this wonderful fish, the more my respect and affection grew and my passion for it snowballed into an obsession. I’d like to narrate one short anecdote from the book here, which, eventually, is said to have won this little-known fish the crowning glory across the globe.
During the British Raj in India, a young British officer was deputised to India in the Assam Province. This English gentleman, like many others from his native country, happened to be an avid angler.
After having comfortably settled and reported for duty, this guy started frequenting the officers’ club to chill out the evenings with his native countrymen. One evening, the fellow officers began to discuss fishing.
The newcomer launched himself into blowing his trumpet on his exploits on salmon fishing back home. He seemed a trifle too long-winded. One of the fellow officers cut in on him and asked, “Have you heard about the mahseer that is found in the Indian rivers”?
When his fellow officers filled him in on the native gamefish, the fellow retorted, “What’s mahseer? There’s no match whatsoever to the ‘lordly” salmon when it comes to freshwater fishing,” he snapped back and went on rambling on about the salmon. It’d be like chasing a wild goose to bring him around, the others realised.

A passionate angler as he was, he could not resist himself from trying his hand at fishing. One day, he decided, rather disdainfully, to go fishing to one of the rivers. After something like an hour, he finally got a bite, a big one at that.
A huge 40-pounder mahseer bit his baited hook—and all hell broke loose! The battle ensued. After sweating it out well over an hour, he finally landed the prize fish. Fittingly tamed and cut down to his size by the ferocious fighter, the Englishman from that day onwards never talked about the ‘lordly’ salmon.
The mahseer rewrote history. It became a legend. For the Englishmen, it became the most sought-after gamefish and a hot topic for writing. Books upon books, volumes upon volumes dedicated themselves to this charismatic species.
World fame
Apart from The Rod in India, other epics included The Angler in India or the Mighty Mahseer (1903) by Skene Dhu and The Compleat Indian Angler (2003) by John Masters, among a horde of others. Soon, the fame spread across the globe. Jim Corbett called it ‘the fish of my dreams’ and went on to christen it ‘the tiger of the water’.  Skene Dhu named it the ‘Mighty Mahseer’. In the later years, even films were shot on mahseer-angling.
“Of all the mammoth challenges still facing the world’s fishermen today, mahseer along the Himalayas is one of the greatest. Anyone who goes to the Himalayas and pulls off a fish or two has really recorded a triumph, a place in the history of fishing,” wrote John Bailey (writer, photographer and world-class angler), who also did a documentary film on the Golden Mahseer for the BBC’s Discovery Channel in 1990.
Recently, in 2017, fishinghimalayas.com, organised the filming of the “Fishing Impossible” the BBC Earth TV series. The quest was for the ‘gold’—the Golden Mahseer. The film was shot in the Phewa and Begnas lakes, Pokhara and also extended to the far west Nepal to Babai and the Karnali waters.

Indomitable fighter
Yes, it is unarguably the most ferocious freshwater gamefish in the world. Known to fight like cornered leopards, they exhibit brute power and lightning speed that no other river fish can match.
If hooked, a big mahseer sends shivers down every angler’s spine and even the most accomplished angler is humbled by its unbridled fury. Elusive and notoriously difficult to catch, it’s a daunting challenge that demands immense stamina to travel rugged terrain and face harsh weather conditions. Ultimately, your mind must be trained to revel not only in your success but with untold frustrating failures, too.

A true mahseer angler is the ‘breed’, who, time and again, must frequent that riverbank where he went through many failures and hardship. It’s like the stubborn mountaineer who fails to summit the Everest but doggedly keeps at it no matter what it takes . . . until he is rewarded.
Tackle & gear
The modern day tackle for fishing mahseer includes state-of-the-art reels, high-density carbon or graphite rods, top-of-the-shelf lines and myriad of lures that include the spinners, spoons, jerk-baits, you name it. Some, go for live-baits like minnows and apart from artificial flies, fly-fishers even try live river nymphs.
Smashed rods, mangled hooks, broken lines and shattered reels are not uncommon, particularly if the angler fails to handle the big mahseer that decides to dash for the nearest rapid. And you are just left wondering how the hell that happened! An angler once equated grappling the big ‘beast’ with a 10-round bout with no less a boxer than Mike Tyson!

The joy and thrill of hooking a big one is so immense that the mahseer angler never tires of relating his experience—the bite, the jerk and the initial rush the brute makes, which can be anything from 100 to 200 yards of your line, as you race along the rocky bank to keep pace with it and finally . . . land it.

Passion bordering on obsession
The book by A. St. J. Macdonald made me ‘take the bait.’ I devoted seven long years to do the study on this species, which took me to a host of rivers stretching from the east to the west of Nepal (read my previous stories).
One of my wanderings to the Koshi in East Nepal to Mai Beni, Baraha Chhetra in 2005 in pursuit of the Golden Mahseer (barbus tor putitora), Pahenle Sahar in Nepali, was the most memorable. I was hung-up on raising a little awareness among the anglers and the local fishing community about the endangered status of the golden mahseer and how to practice conservation methods.
The entire trip to Mai Beni with my fisher friends of Dharan was fraught with a mortal fear that we might, at any time, confront the Maoist activists as the length and breadth of the country was hard hit by Maoist insurgency. Luckily, we did not.
I had not the foggiest idea that my visit caused quite a stir in Mai Beni and Baraha Chhetra. After I was back home in Kathmandu, my Dharan friends called me to say that the Maoist cadres made inquiries about the city-slicker (yours truly), who had the nerve to mislead the riverside fishing community by asking them to release their catches, which meant virtually the same as forgoing their bread and butter. They’d completely misjudged my intentions.
Home for mahseer 
Nepal, under the shadows of the Himalayas, is a maze of rivers, snow-fed and spring-fed, flowing down south into the Ganges, India. Many of these rivers are home to the legendary mahseer including the most-coveted Himalayan Golden Mahseer—considered the ‘icing on the cake’ by anglers.
Local fisherman at Koshi Barrage
Our rivers like the Karnali, Bheri, Seti, Mahakali, Narayani and the Mighty Koshi with her seven tributaries hold this species in bountiful supply.
Fishing for mahseer has been an age-old custom among the fishing community of Nepal. If it means bread and butter for them, for other local aficionados, it serves as a great recreational sport. As the access to modern-day tackle for most is still off-limit, they still resort today to the primitive crude methods.
Local fisher at Mai Beni, east Nepal
My angling tours to the Sapta Koshi, Arun, Tammar, Sun Koshi and Tama Koshi rivers in the east and the Karnali, Trishuli and Babai in the west revealed many big mahseer catches from 10 to 35 kilos made by the local riverside community. Most of such catches were made on thapuwa balchhi―hooks baited with live fish cast at night and retrieved in the morning. Such catches also included Goonch catfish, which can grow to monster sizes and are found in our rivers, both the east and the west.
The primitive method of fishing days are long past for the present-day fishers. It has been replaced by modern fishing tackle and hardware with futuristic reels and latter-day rods, hooks, lures and line.

Migratory run
Mahseer is a migratory cold water fish that inhabits rivers and lakes that have inlets and outlets to a river. It spawns during monsoon floods (June-September). Much the same as the salmon travels hundreds of miles upstream to spawn, the mahseer ascents up-river to considerable heights (from as low as 300 ft. to 2,500ft from sea level), to placid spring-fed feeder streams, to spawn and deposit their eggs.
After the monsoon they return to the foothills, then migrate back again to the upper reaches to breed where there are many snow and glacier-fed rivers—the mahseers’ natural habitat. It is called the migratory run.
During my fishing trip to Mai Beni, my veteran fisher friends had their own way of drawing their views about the migration run.  “When the Brahimini ducks or the Ruddy Shelducks were sighted taking to their wings from the riverbanks and the Koshi revealed schools of  minnows darting upriver literally between our knees in the clear water, we knew the mahseers were on their migratory run,” said Bharat Sunuwar, one of my fisher friends from Dharan.
That was not something my fisher friends learned from a book but from nuances of long experience at the river. I called it the ‘river lore’.

The monsoon is upon us. No word sounded lovelier when in mid-June the vast sky opened up and slaked the parched ashy-grey cityscape generously with the rains after the long spell of fierce heat the metropolis dished out during the last week of May.
It came belatedly, only on the 20th of June as against the normal onset time, the 10th of June. First arrived the gentle showers in fine droplets, but as the days went by—as unpredictable as they could get—turned into downpours followed by battering cloudbursts.

You can never tell when they appear or stop as quickly as they started, and without so much as a whisper pick up where they left off. Come monsoon, the heavens open up as they say it.
I saw it for the last 66 years, will continue to do so; so did my forbears in the same spirit; so will you, and your posterity . . . and theirs. Folks, like it or lump it, you have to learn to live with it simply because it’s the monsoon.
Green at its best
Yes, look around and you’ll find it green all around you—the countryside, the suburbs, the lush paddy fields and the forested hills that stand out clear as the rains wash the murky smog off. And this is the time of the year when the rains help to scour our rivers clean of the appalling pile-up of filth. I, for one, sit on my patio and watch my tiny garden grow greener, as it were, challenging the emeralds. My eyes stray from one plant to another seemingly jostling with each other to grow faster and greener, the creepers reaching for the sky, and the flowers vying for my attention.
Curiously, even the grass on my lawn seems to race against the clock in its bid to turn greener and lusher! And my little cairn sits in the corner looking awesome (took a lot of effort for me to stack them). I sit quietly and try to soak everything in. Lo and behold, even my turtle seems to enjoy it! Suddenly, I hear the crack of thunder and soon the rains arrive. I proudly look at my garden and ask myself: “Isn’t it green at its best?”

Gosh! That unmistakable scent as the raindrops meet the soil on the flower beds, the lawn, and the flowerpots! I just love it. Earthy, fresh—but what else—musky, pungent . . . ? My olfactory dictionary lacks the word to describe it.
When the raindrops hit the dust or clay soil, they trap tiny air bubbles on the surface, which subsequently shoot upward–redolent of a glass of champagne—bursts, and then like an aerosol sprays out that bizarre fragrance. Science says: it is petrichor.
Jogging memories
Yes! As I sit back on my patio watching the rains, old memories come flooding by—some are sweet, some not-so-sweet, others bitter closely followed by past incidents that make for amusing anecdotes to look back on . . . and live them. I call them my monsoon escapades. One particular occurrence that took place some eight years ago in the lake-city Pokhara still feels like only yesterday. For that, we will have to travel back in time. Shall we?
Angling in Fewa

I’m nuts about fishing. Whether ponds, rivers, reservoirs or lakes, they draw me like the bees to the honeypot. Big lake, bigger bags, I thought excitedly when I arrived in Pokhara.
I hired a boat at the Fewa lakeside and set out with a local guy feeling high as a kite when I learned that he was an old hand at the game. My fishing guide suggested that we picked one of the isolated spots on the opposite bank to give a wide berth to scores of boaters that crowded the lake. Perfect, I said to myself.
 

 
The morning looked promising—a clear sky sans the monsoon clouds as we headed across the emerald-green water of Lake Fewa armed to the teeth with our fishing tackles. The lake holds gamefish such as rohu (Asian wild carp), common carp, catla (Asian carp), tilapia and bighead, among others.
 

The thought that I might run into a Golden Mahseer (highly prized by avid anglers) or two fired my imagination. Our small two-man boat made it to the opposite bank before we knew it. It seemed my fisher friend was good at paddling too.
We lost no time. Honestly, I could not wait to cast my line. I beamed happily to find no soul around the spot at the early hour. The water calm and beckoning. The forested foothill rose high up behind our backs. Save for the sound of the ebb and flow of the water that slapped against the sandy bank and receded like clockwork, the total hush felt almost spooky.
The cool crisp morning felt invigorating. The musty, earthy smell of the lake waters felt gratifying while the wooded hills reminded me of being in the lap of nature. “This is total bliss,” I thought aloud.
For bait, we had a mix of chicken feed and refined flour kneaded into a fine dough. Man, did it smell awful! My partner told me that he’d added a dash of tongba (a light local-beer made from fermented millet) sediment. This fish-bait concoction was Pokhara’s local favorite.
Apart from it, my partner fished out something from a plastic bag. It was cow (buffalo?) dung! To my great disgust, he made them into balls with his bare hand and wrapped up the baited hook with it. Ugh! When I asked why the dung, he said that the smell lured the fish. I’d done a lot of fishing but that came as a total surprise. Later, I learned that to be a common practice among fishers in Pokhara.
The fishing began. With bated breath, I hurled my first line weighed down by the wonder dough, then another. So did my partner—four rods in total. All we had to do then was lie back and wait with an eye on the tip of the rod for a tug from the fish . . . and, of course, our fingers crossed. Fishing means waiting it out, which could be hours without flinching a muscle. I regretted not having brought a book to kill time.
Total blank
The waiting seemed truly excruciating as the morning drew closer to noon. In between the time, we changed our baits and switched the cast-spots. Except for feeble bites, not worth a jerk at the line, we kept in wait, pinning our hopes on a big catch. Time for lunch, my partner announced. He’d brought big fat tuna sandwiches that made my mouth water.
After three in the afternoon, I began to despair. No bites, whatsoever! On the other hand, my partner fumed and cursed. “Preposterous,” he blurted out, his frustration written all over his face. “This has never happened before,” he lamented loudly.
Later, my partner seemed to fuss about as he changed our hooks, added a little more of the smelly tongba to the dough and asked me to move farther along to our right. Practically, he did everything going by the book. I stayed quiet trying not to let my disappointment show.
For me, the improved bait, the rejigging of the hooks and the change of spot brought high hopes. I cast my line with renewed energy, the suspense killing me. Suddenly, at around four in the afternoon, the weather seemed to take a mood-swing as low-hanging dark clouds drifted in over the lake. The bag remained at naught.
Disaster struck
And to confirm my fears, the sky rumbled and a bolt of lightning snaked through the air. Time, we called it a day, I thought. Fishing during thunder lightning is dangerous as the fishing rods, normally made of graphite or carbon-fiber, act as good conductors and may add to the risk of a lightning strike.
That was about it all. Resignedly, we hurriedly packed our gear and prepared to leave lest the rains beat us to it. I felt the first droplets on my cheeks even before we started. Before long, they turned into larger drops sounding the warning bells. Then, all hell broke loose before we could gather our wits!
Hardly had we paddled 50 yards than it began pouring, soon replaced by a cloudburst that tore down at us in torrents. We could hardly see five feet beyond the bow through the sheets of rain. That scared the pants off of me. It did not end at that. Damn!
Our luck seemed to run out on us. Suddenly, the high drama took another twist and we were out of the frying pan into the fire. The small boat started filling up with the rainwater. Soon, it rose to a dangerous level of the hull. As my partner furiously worked the paddles, I frantically bailed the water out with the small bucket that previously carried the fish bait.
Close shave
I started shivering. The rains brought in a chillness to the air. I think it was both fear and the chill that did it when it suddenly struck me that I did not know how to swim. As my companion dug in deep with the paddles, I feverishly kept at hurling the water out, the rain almost blinding my vision. Did I pray too? I do not remember . . . I must have. Suddenly, a question flashed across my mind. Are we going to capsize and sink?
After what appeared like a half-hour, the dreadful ordeal ended. The rain fell back to a light shower. I still shook uncontrollably as we made it to the opposite bank. I eventually sighed in relief. Suddenly it dawned on me that I’d be celebrating my forthcoming birthday. Phew!
As I finished writing, the sky again opened up for the rains. Folks, its monsoon time!

Vines, wild ferns, creepers, lush foliage, dense undergrowth, and an occasional fallen tree greeted us as we climbed up the steps. The damp places showed rocks encrusted with lush green moss. The mingled smell of the damp earth, the pines, the rotting fallen leaves, decaying wood, the dead foliage intensified by the ‘petrichor’ brought in by the recent rains made my head swim.
I spotted a shallow pit by the side of the trail, obviously dug up by a wild boar to forage for roots and tubers. Suddenly, the forest came alive with an ear-splitting sound. The cicadas! The loudest among all the insects of the world, they are ‘one of nature’s great sound–atmospheric and enigmatic.’

While doing frequent cycling jaunts on the Mudkhu-Teen Piplé-Sanglé route north-west of the Kathmandu valley rim, I’d instinctively look up to my north at the towering forested hills above Jitpur Phedi, my eyes glued to the breach on the sheer craggy height. It literally beckoned.
That crack on the naked rock-face, the local folks say, is the Tarkeshwor Mahadev shrine. For years, I longed to go there, but never got around to it. Someday . . . I’d keep telling myself. And the day did come on the last week of June 2019.
For mountain bikers, the two-and-a-half-hour round trip on the Mudkhu-Teen Piplé-Sanglé circuit, first on a paved road and later a dirt road past quaint little village-towns like Jitpur Phedi, Kabhresthali, and Sanglé promises a decent cross-country spin.

The track offers both modest up-hills and rock-strewn down-hills to thrill the mountain biking buffs including the “bikeoholics” (mountain biking limbo meaning hardcore riders) to while away their weekend mornings.  Small wonder, it has become a popular haunt for all the bikers.
Hiking not biking                                                                                   
This time, the trip happened to be a hike and not a ride on my bicycle. There were five of us –Shayeet, my cycling partner, his mother, Shalu, my wife, Radhika, I and a teenager guest from Bangladesh, Adriana. A first cousin to Shayeet, she was in Kathmandu for her holiday.  We made quite a mixed bunch, old, not-very-old and kids in their teens!
From left to right: Shayeet, Adriana, Shayeet’s mom and Radhika (front)
None of us had been to the place before, so no one knew the route.  A quick look on the Internet helped me. We decided on a ride to Teen Piplé and then hike from there (buses ply on the road as it happens to be the Trishuli Highway with beautiful hill-towns like Kakani and Rani Pauwa en route). We did not catch a bus but drove instead, a 45-minute ride, in my car.
Wavering start
As the Internet did not have enough info on the place, things like distance, villages on the track, teahouses and the like, we thought it best to pack our lunch. Later, we found that we had figured it right.
As we planned to leave after breakfast, we prepared the food the previous night. With rain-jackets, umbrellas, water bottles, and, whatnots taken care of, we were all set to backpack it to Tarkeshwor the next day.
Come the next day, and I awoke to a sudden thrumming, which soon turned into a familiar pelting sound. Oh, no–the rain! I cursed. I always love the sound of the rain drumming on the windows and the floor outside my patio.  But never did I hate the rains so much than that particular morning. At first, it was just a light pitter-patter, but soon it started pouring.
“There goes our trip down the drain,” I hollered. Hoping for the impossible to happen, Radhika and I helped ourselves with breakfast.  More likely than not, the rest of the group, our close neighbors, was going through the same plight.
The rain, lo and behold, suddenly showed the signs of letting up. Miraculously, it stopped. A little later the sun started peeking in through the clouds.  Radhika’s phone rang, and the group made a hurried appearance. Time to move; everyone piled into the car and I took the wheel.
The winding drive past Mudkhu Bhanjhyang with the towering Nagarjun hill blanketed with the dense forest was a sight for sore eyes after the unsightly urban sprawl and the traffic snarl at the busy Ring Road. The paved road until Osho Tapoban, the Rajneesh Meditation Centre, was fairly good.
Because of muddy stretches, the onward driving got tricky and slowed down almost to a crawl.  It bothered me that we might get caught out on the thick muck as the road was riddled with frequent muddy puddles, and deep ruts, which never seemed to end. Phew! To my great relief, we finally made it to Teen Piplé, the kick-off point for our hike.
The Hike

After parking our car at Teen Piplé, we picked up a few tips about the trail from the locals and hit the country pathway.  As I could foretell, some said it would take an hour; others put it at a little over two hours. That’s how it is in the villages. Ten minutes can be a half-hour and an hour nothing less than two hours.
The ladies were spared the lugging as Shayeet and I volunteered to carry the backpacks with our food and other stuffs. “Whoa!” That came off Radhika. The long flight of steps right from the start looked intimidating.  As it turned out, the trail seemed to be interspersed with dirt paths that made it easier for Radhika (she has a knee problem).
Panch Mané

The trail continued uphill with scattered houses and cultivated lands amidst the country landscape. The hillside appeared green with sparse woodland, extensive spread of lush maize-crops and vegetables growing in small patches adjoining the houses. As we huffed it uphill, a little before the town of Panch Mané, our eyes met an impressive sight.

At first sight, we took it for a gompa(monastery) as the hills of the Kathmandu Valley rim are dotted with them. On cresting the ridge, it, however, turned out to be a Hindu shrine, the Bhuwaneswori Temple. Goddess Bhuwaneswori is none other than goddesses Bhagwati or Durga and revered as a manifestation of the formidable Kali Mata, too.

The multi-tiered pagoda-shaped temple with overhanging eaves and the roofs finished in golden colour stood high from the ground lending a dignified look. A long flight of steps led to the entrance.  A young pujari (priest) led us in for the darshan (homage). As expected, no photography was allowed.
After the darshan, to our great surprise, the pujari offered a plate of Prasad (devotional offer of food) to each of us, which included fresh-fried puri, haluwa (kind of sweet made out of semolina) and potato curry. That mightily impressed us all. Starved as I was, I was tempted to go for a second helping, but checked myself.
“The temple was built some seven years back by Shyam Baba but the building was razed to the ground in the 2015 earthquake. The baba, who is also a great scholar, took the pains to rebuild it after the earthquake,” informed the young priest. A number of small pagoda-style houses in the foreground of the main temple, he said, were Baba’s living quarters.

“Devotees throng the temple twice every year to observe Navratri, once in summer (Ram Nawami/Chait-dashain) and again at the onset of winter during Vijaya Dashami or dashain,” the young priest added.

The trail then climbed again and met with a dirt road that led to the Panch Mané village. The cluster of houses lining the road also included a homestay.  As we continued along the road, our eyes caught sight of a number of round brick structures, three to be exact, which appeared like water storage tanks. They were not.

“They are historic Manés (homogeneous to Buddhist stupas), which date back to the times of Prithvi Narayan Shah. This village is in fact named after those manés, “said Bijay Aryal, a local guy I happened to run into.
“During those days, there were four entry points into the Kathmandu Valley and Panch Mané happened to be one of them. Going by history, while stationed at Panch Mané, King Prithvi  Narayan Shah contemplated the invasion of the then Valley of Nepal(Kathmandu, Bhadgaon, and Lalitpur),” he further added.
“Before the devastating earthquake of 2015, there were five of them, thus, the name Panch(five) Mané. Two of them were swept away in a landslip following the earthquake,” Bijay further explained.
After a cup of tea at a local teashop and a brief respite, we resumed our hike. The dirt road ended at a wooded foothill and turned into a narrow foot trail. With no habitation and not a soul around the trail climbed through tall pine trees and brush.
Shortly, the stone steps appeared, and Radhika broke into one of her vociferous protests (she did that during our last hike to Bishnudwar in the Shivapuri heights, too). Howsoever grumbling she did on such hikes, she loves it in all reality. She is plucky, all right!
The rest of us were doing good. Only Adriana seemed breathless and looked tired. She told me that she had never done a tough hike like that before and never been to that high an elevation. She came from Dhaka, an elevation of just four meters from the sea-level and with no hill whatsoever in sight.

And there she was slogging it up a steep hill doing above 1,700m from the sea-level! Great work, I said to the brave girl from Dhaka. She smiled back and said that she was really enjoying it, and that she will have quite a story to tell her friends back home.

The forest
The trail got steeper and wound up through the thick forest. We came across a board that declared we were within the Shivapuri National Park. As we gained elevation, the tall pines were replaced by the deciduous broad-leaved forest, both temperate and sub-tropical. Surprisingly, the trail remained hushed with no one in sight. The only sound we could hear was the faint call of the birds and the wild crickets.
Vines, wild ferns, creepers, lush foliage, dense undergrowth, and an occasional fallen tree greeted us as we climbed up the steps. The damp places showed rocks encrusted with lush green moss. The mingled smell of the damp earth, the pines, the rotting fallen leaves, decaying wood, the dead foliage intensified by the ‘petrichor’ brought in by the recent rains made my head swim.

I spotted a shallow pit by the side of the trail, obviously dug up by a wild boar to forage for roots and tubers. Suddenly, the forest came alive with an ear-splitting sound. The cicadas! The loudest among all the insects of the world, they are ‘one of nature’s great sound–atmospheric and enigmatic.’
The Shrine

After something like an hour on the trail uphill, we spotted a metal step ladder leaned against a sheer rock face with overhanging undergrowth.  We had finally made it to the Tarkeshwor Mahadev. The height commanded a birds-eye-view of the valley–once pristine and verdant some three decades ago now looking pathetic enveloped in filthy haze and smog.

The main shrine in two storeys seemed carved into a solid huge boulder looking like an alcove with a sheer drop to its south. A stone Shivalinga with four faces (mukhalinga) sat in the far corner and a stone Nandi (sacred bull calf), a vehicle and gatekeeper of Lord Shiva, stood sentinel in the foreground. A small pit next to the entrance held a little stagnant water. In fact, it was not.

“The water in that pit is from the sacred lake in the Himalayas, the Gosaikunda (4,380m). The water drains into it perennially,” said Baba Shrinath, the only mortal we met on the hike. A flight of metal steps went up to a narrow rocky overhang in the upper storey, which housed metal bells and a trident.

“The Tarkeshwor Mahadev is said to have surfaced at the present site in the Satyayug (Golden Age; the first-ever epoch on earth) when one of the lifeless limbs of Lord Shiva’s first consort, Goddess Sati Devi’s right limb fell off at the spot,” the Baba shed light on it by recounting one of the mythological accounts from the Swasthani Brata Katha .
“The Gosaikunda water began draining into the pit as a result of deep-seated tapasya (spiritual deep meditation, an exercise in austerity, and self-discipline) performed by yogis (saints) from the Satyayug,” the baba further added. He has been residing at the Tarkeshwor site for the last 25 years.

I was so famished that I could eat a horse, so were the others. We wolfed down our packed lunch of home-cooked chicken biryani and matar paneer, rested a bit and then backtracked down the hill. At Panch Mané, we came across an open truck parked beside a teashop. We asked the driver if we could hitch a ride up to Teen Piplé. It was a big yes.
Radhika seemed the happiest as the way back still meant coping with a long flight of knee-buckling steps down to Teen Piplé (going down-steps hurts the knees more for those with the problem).  Frankly, I was too, for I was spared her screaming bloody murder at me.
