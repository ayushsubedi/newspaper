FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

2,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

3,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

4,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

KATHMANDU: The government has set the target to garner more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors’ conference being organised on June 25 for the post-quake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
A study of losses caused by the devastating Gorkha Quake on April 25 and its aftershocks in various regions across the country shows that physical infrastructures worth Rs 512 billion were damaged by the quake and over Rs 666 billion was needed for reconstruction, rehabilitation and new construction.
The government is preparing to collect the assistance by presenting the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) report in the conference prepared by the National Planning Commission for the same.
According to the PDNA report, over Rs 399 billion is necessary for reconstruction and rehabilitation tasks in cultural heritage, education, health and human settlement sectors.
Similarly, Rs 117 billion is needed for reconstruction of agriculture, industry, irrigation and tourism sectors.
Likewise, the PDNA report estimates that it will cost Rs 74.26 billion for reconstruction of media, community infrastructures, hydropower, transport and drinking water and sanitation sectors while Rs 75.11 billion to recover the damaged gender, social security, nutrition, employment, environment and forest areas into previous position.

The trend of drinking beer in Nepal has increased in recent years and consumers are searching for diverse options making the country a good and strategic market for new beer brands, opined Wouter Peeters, VP Strategy and New Business Development, South Asia of ABInBev, a multinational drink and brewing company based in Belgium.
ABInBev, in coordination with Raj Brewery — a subsidiary of Jawalakhel Group of Industries (JGI) — is preparing to launch premium beer Budweiser in the Nepali market in May. Peeters is currently in Nepal to develop the strategy to launch the new beer brand.
“Consumers in Asia, including Nepal are open about trying new brands and are always seeking a new taste. This gives the opportunity for any beer brand to come to Nepal,” said Peeters, adding that ABInBev will try to tap this opportunity through the launch of its premium brand Budweiser. For a new brand in Asia, Peeters believes that the biggest challenge is to unleash the opportunity available in the region itself.

ABInBev believes that Budweiser, a premium beer, will become the primary choice of beer drinkers in Nepal in a short period of time. The company had launched Fosters beer three months ago in the Nepali market and Peeters says the beer is doing impressively well here. “Nepal’s market has a good space for premium beers like Budweiser and Fosters.
Though we will also bring other brands from ABInBev, we will first ensure that these two beer brands create a niche in the Nepali market,” he added.
It has been three weeks since JGI started selling the first batch of Fosters beer in Nepal.
Peeters further informed that a state-of-the-art brewery is being set up to produce the Budweiser beer in Nepal in coordination with JGI. “Once the brewery is ready, we will start producing Budweiser and send a sample of the product to ABiNBev for taste and approval.
Following the approval of the taste, we will launch Budweiser for consumers in Nepal.”
Peeters informed that Budweiser is the 27th most valuable brand in the world. With a high focus on quality, Budweiser has also been sponsoring mega football events like FIFA World Cup, LaLiga and English Premier League. “All these assets will further help Budweiser claim its stake in the Nepali market,” Peeters stated.
As a premium beer, Budweiser is expected to be comparatively costlier than the other beer brands currently available in the domestic market.

Banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have expressed their reservations on joining the Social Security Fund (SSF) of the government and the recent direction from Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) to join the social security scheme.
As BFIs were reluctant to join the social security scheme of the government citing biasness in policies for private and government firms, the central bank last week had directed BFIs to join the social security programme mandatorily.
However, members of the Nepal Financial Institution Association (NFIA) — association of people working in banks and financial institutions of the country — have threatened to launch protests if the central bank does not roll back its direction compelling BFIs to participate in the social security scheme.
“The regulatory body has issued such a circular without consulting BFIs. Moreover, directing BFIs to join the social security scheme of the government is not under the jurisdiction of the central bank,” reads a press statement issued by NFIA, adding that financial institutions will not join the social security programme as the programme does not ensure basic rights of workers in the financial sector.
“We will be compelled to start protests if NRB does not roll back its direction,” the statement adds.

The government had set the deadline of November 30 for the private sector to get listed in its ambitious scheme which will provide pension to retired employees of the private sector as well. However, government is on verge of extending the deadline as participation of institutions, especially BFIs in this scheme has not been encouraging.
Moreover, commercial banks have expressed their concern on the unclear policies adopted in the social security scheme for employees. “Undoubtedly, the social security scheme is a good programme. However, bank employees have not been ensured basic facilities that they should get thus discouraging us to immediately join the scheme,” said Bhuvan Dahal, chief executive officer of Sanima Bank.
“We are already registered at the Employees Provident Fund and Citizen Investment Trust.
Hence, why should we join the social security scheme of the government if we are not ensured of facilities that we have been already getting through these agencies?” questioned Dahal.
Primarily, bankers have been demanding that the government include insurance policy for dependent family members of the banking staffers. Likewise, they are also demanding that mandatory registration of staffers in the Social Security Fund be implemented only for those who had joined the institution after the fund was established.
Dahal, who is also the newly elected president of Nepal Bankers’ Association (NBA), informed that NBA will soon hold a meeting with NRB and convince the central bank about the concerns of the banks regarding the social security programme.
So far, 131,577 workers and 11,797 employers have been listed in the social security scheme.

Stakeholders have been found to be ignoring the Tourist Search, Rescue, Medication and Monitoring Guidelines-2018 implemented by the Department of Tourism (DoT).
Aiming to ensure security of tourists, DoT had implemented the aforementioned guideline last year and directed the trekking agencies, airline operators and chopper companies, hospitals and medical pharmacies to submit the details related with tourist search, rescue and medication to the department.
However, no agency or other institutions have yet submitted the details to DoT even after the close of the autumn tourist season this year.
As per the guideline, concerned authorities are obliged to submit all the details (including minor situations) to DoT within 15 days after the climbing season concludes.
Likewise, according to Article 9 of the guideline, any person, agency or company involved in search, rescue and treatment should provide the details with original invoice of all the cost incurred during such missions to the concerned agency for payment. And such details are supposed to be submitted to the DoT within one month after the season concludes.
However, the department has not received any detail from any concerned authority regarding the autumn season expeditions (September, October and November). Hence, the DoT published a notice on Friday directing the agencies and companies involved in search, rescue and medication to submit all the details at DoT within seven days.
“The department will take action against any company that ignores the given deadline and does not provide the factual information within seven days,” reads the notice.
After the fake rescue scam was revealed in the mountaineering sector of the country, DoT in association with the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation had implemented the guideline to regulate search, rescue and medication activities.
This autumn season, DoT had issued expedition permits to a total of 165 teams that comprised of a total of 1,210 members. The expedition permits had been issued for 53 peaks of the country.

18,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/whats-in-the-us-china-phase-one-trade-deal/,"WASHINGTON: The United States and China have agreed on the terms of a “phase one” trade deal that reduces some US tariffs on Chinese goods while boosting Chinese purchases of American farm, energy and manufactured goods and addressing some US complaints about intellectual property practices.
Following are details of the deal released by both sides. The broad outlines were similar to a deal in principle announced https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-premier-liu-peoples-republic-china-meeting by Trump in October that was dominated by increased Chinese purchases of US agricultural goods.

TARIFFS
The United States will not proceed with 15% tariffs scheduled to go into effect on Sunday on nearly $160 billion worth of Chinese goods, including cell phones, laptop computers, toys and clothing.
China canceled its retaliatory tariffs due to take effect that same day, including a 25% tariff on US-made autos.
The United States will cut by half the tariff rate it imposed on Sept 1. on a $120 billion list of Chinese goods, to 7.5%
US tariffs of 25% on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods will remain unchanged, providing US negotiating leverage for a second phase of negotiations next year.

TRADE DEFICIT
US officials say China agreed to increase purchases of American products and services by at least $200 billion over the next two years, with an expectation that the higher purchases will continue after that period.
The purchases include manufactured goods, agricultural goods, energy and services, and are expected to reduce the $419 billion US trade deficit with China, officials said. China bought $130 billion in US goods in 2017, before the trade war began, and $56 billion in services, US data show.

AGRICULTURE
China has committed to increase purchases of US agriculture products by $32 billion over two years. That would average an annual total of about $40 billion, compared to a baseline of $24 billion in 2017 before the trade war started.
Trump has demanded that China buy $50 billion worth of American farm goods annually. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said China agreed to make its best efforts to increase its purchases by another $5 billion annually to get close $50 billion.
China has committed to reduce non-tariff barriers to agricultural products such as poultry, seafood and feed additives as well as approval of biotechnology products.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The deal includes stronger Chinese legal protections for patents, trademarks, copyrights, including improved criminal and civil procedures to combat online infringement, pirated and counterfeit goods.
The deal contains commitments by China to follow through on previous pledges to eliminate any pressure for foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms as a condition of market access, licensing or administrative approvals and to eliminate any government advantages for such transfers.
China also agreed to refrain from directly supporting outbound investment aimed at acquiring foreign technology to meet its industrial plans — transactions already restricted by stronger US security reviews.

CURRENCY
The currency agreement contains pledges by China to refrain from competitive currency devaluations and to not target its exchange rate for a trade advantage — language that China has accepted for years as part of its commitments to the Group of 20 major economies.
The deal subjects any violations of currency commitments to the agreement’s enforcement mechanism, under which they could incur US tariffs.
A senior Trump administration official said the currency agreement is based on provisions in the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement trade deal, which require the three countries to disclose monthly data on international reserve balances and intervention in foreign exchange markets, along with quarterly balance-of-payments data and other public reporting to the International Monetary Fund.

ENFORCEMENT
Under dispute resolution is an arrangement allowing parties to resolve differences over how the deal is implemented through bilateral consultations, starting at the working level and escalating to top-level officials. If these consultations do not resolve disputes, there is a process for imposing tariffs or other penalties.
Lighthizer told reporters the United States expected neither side would retaliate if appropriate action was taken as part of the process and following “consultation in good faith.”

CHINA FINANCIAL SERVICES
US officials said the deal includes improved access to China’s financial services market for US companies, including in banking, insurance, securities and credit rating services. It aims to address a number of longstanding US complaints about investment barriers in the sector including foreign equity limitations and discriminatory regulatory requirements.
China, which has pledged for years to open up its financial services sector to more foreign competition, said the deal would boost imports of financial services from the United States.
But China‘s state-run Global Times newspaper said that not all foreign institution will be able to tap China‘s financial market. “Naturally, entities from countries which are friendly to China will be favored by the Chinese people,” the paper said in a commentary.

In contrast, the capital expenditure of the government as of today stands at a paltry 8.5 per cent of the allocated development budget for this fiscal year.
Earlier, NEA had set a target of spending Rs 13.11 billion for various projects during the review period.
However, the actual spending in the four months stood at Rs 13.31 billion. As per NEA, the projects, however, were able to make overall physical progress of 86 per cent of the set target.
Kul Man Ghising, managing director of NEA, informed that the authority was able to show impressive financial progress owing to advance payments made to contractors and clearance of remaining dues of last year to multiyear contract projects.

“Despite hassles related to forest clearance, land acquisition process, obstruction by locals while installing transmission and distribution lines, we managed to surpass the target set for financial progress,” Ghising said, adding that it was possible due to the support of different government agencies directly linked to NEA.
Of the total allocated budget of Rs 55.61 billion for this fiscal, NEA has managed Rs 10.31 billion from government sources and Rs 45.30 billion from foreign loans and grants.
Ghising further said that they have faced some difficulties due to higher ratio of foreign grants and loans in its allocated budget compared to the budget from government sources.
As per NEA, it was able to generate 74 megawatts of electricity in the review period — 60 MW from Upper Trishuli and 14 MW from Kulekhani III. Similarly, it was able to commission the 132 kV Kabeli corridor transmission line, which had been stagnant since last two years due to obstruction by locals and community forest group.
Similarly, in generation section, the power utility had planned to spend Rs 4.42 billion, while it was able to spend Rs 3.33 billion, which is 75.46 per cent of financial progress. The projects in this category achieved 76.63 per cent of physical progress in the review period.
In the review period, 193 circuit kilometres of six transmission line projects were completed. Similarly, seven substations were finished and eight substations were upgraded.

The Department of Revenue Investigation (DRI) today filed a revenue leakage case against six individuals seeking fines worth Rs 3.35 million.t
The case has been registered at the Kathmandu District Court against Ranjeet Shrestha, Santa Bahadur Ojha, Santosh Rai, Niza Mudhin, Abhaya Raj Ghimire and Krishna Nanda Bhattarai on charge of attempting to legalise and sell illegally imported vehicles from India.
The group was found illegally importing Toyota Fortune vehicles and selling them using fake vehicle number plates. A month ago, the department had caught the team attempting to sell two illegally imported Toyata Fortune vehicles using fake Nepali numbers.
Among the accused, Abhaya Raj Ghimire was preparing to purchase the vehicle.

“The department has increased monitoring of such activities that directly affects the revenue of the government.
We are conducting a probe on other suspicious issues and activities which will be made public after the probe is completed,” said Dirgha Mainali, director general of the department.
The department had found these vehicles registered at the Transport Management Office in Ekantakuna. However, the registration numbers of these vehicles was not found in the record books of the transport office. Mainali also suspected that there could be other vehicles in the market that have been bought illegally by using fake vehicle registration numbers.

The World Bank (WB) today forecast Nepal’s economy will grow at 6.4 per cent in fiscal year 2019-20, sharply lower than the 8.5 per cent economic growth target set for the year by the government.
Driven by investments in tourism sector, particularly the Visit Nepal 2020 programme, including efforts to increase air connectivity, the WB has also projected an average annual growth rate of 6.5 per cent in the medium term.
Releasing its Nepal Development Update today, the bank said industrial growth is likely to be supported by construction activities, investments in cement and hydropower sectors, and improved capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector, thereby making growths stronger.
The report notes that import growth will slow down as the government implements its programme to keep the fiscal deficit in check, which in return will help contain the trade deficit.
Similarly, inflation is expected to pick up slightly but will remain below five per cent during the forecast period assuming stable agricultural production, regular supply of electricity, and low inflation in India, as per the report.
“Increased exports will be critical to sustained growth over the medium-term. It will be important for the government to continue with reforms to attract foreign investment,” said Kene Ezemenari, senior economist of World Bank. “To effectively support Nepal’s growth aspirations, future reforms will need to be grounded in strong analysis and data,” she added.
Meanwhile, the update has highlighted the importance of data for development, particularly in the context of the country’s historic transition to federalism. Citing that the federalism has created a surge in demand for more and better data, the World Bank has stressed on enhanced data availability to strengthen planning and budgeting at the subnational levels, including the preparation of medium-term expenditure frameworks.
“A robust federal framework, therefore, rests on more and better data that will support evidence-based policies,” reads the report.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada said the need for Nepal is data that is disaggregated, more frequent, reliable and accessible. “Nepal’s federal structure has added another dimension for data at provincial level, which is a challenge but very important for development programmes to leave no one behind. The Statistics Act, which is to be approved soon, is expected to further empower Central Bureau of Statistics and provide added responsibility to subnational governments on data for national policymaking.”
However, Khatiwada mentioned that government will stick to its stand of achieving 8.5 per cent economic growth this year and it would be too early to revise the projection.
In addition, the Nepal Development Update articulates a vision for a future data ecosystem and the need for short-term reforms to make the most of existing data and longterm reforms that establish an enabling environment that fosters data sharing, integration and use.
“Data is central to the success of federalism. Nepal needs a vision and strategy for a future data ecosystem that is aligned to the new federal structure and promotes engagement of civil society and the private sector,” said Faris Hadad-Zervos, World Bank’s country manager for Nepal.

International Mountain Day 2019 was observed in the country today with various events organised within the Kathmandu valley.
Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), in association with Nepal Tourism Board, Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal, Nepal Association of Tour and Travel Agents along with other tourism associations, had organised the events in the valley.
The day was marked in the country with the international slogan for this year — ‘Mountain Matters for Youth’.
NMA kicked off the event today by organising Tenzing-Hillary procession in remembrance of Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Sir Edmund Hillary, who had scaled Mount Everest for the first time, and other climbers. The rally commenced from Basantapur and passed through Chhetrapati, Ganeshman Singh Road, Thamel before concluding at NMA office in Naxal. Various competitions were also held to mark the day.
Last year, the event was celebrated in Pokhara.
On the occasion of International Mountain Day, Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai felicitated some world famous climbers of the country, including Mingma Gyabu Sherpa, Kami Rita Sherpa, Mingma Sherpa, Chhang Dawa Sherpa and Sanu Sherpa.

Meanwhile, Santa Bir Lama, president of NMA, announced that profiles of 476 peaks of the country will be launched during the inauguration of Visit Nepal 2020 campaign. Under the guidance of Department of Tourism, NMA has prepared the profiles with information on the peaks, including routes, itinerary, height of peaks, districts, social condition of the areas, and budget details for climbing the peaks. Lama is also the coordinator of the peak profiling committee.
“We have prepared the peak profiles in a scientific manner with the help of national and international mountain experts,” he said. “The profiles will be beneficial not only for the climbers but also others interested in gathering details of the peaks and its surroundings, including the geography, socio-economic status of the people there, etcetera.”
He further said that the NMA and Nepal government expect the profiles to encourage climbers to attempt to scale virgin peaks.
The International Mountain Day has been celebrated across the world since 2003 for sustainable development of the mountaineering sector.

It appears no Nepali job-seeker vying for Japan will be able to go to the land of the rising sun for employment next year, as all the aspirants have failed the language and skill tests.
In the first phase of job opening for nursing caregivers, 497 Nepalis had appeared for the language test.
While only 56 managed to pass the test, all of them flunked the subsequent job-related skill test. The tests had been conducted by Japan Foundation.
Umesh Dhungana, joint secretary at Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MoLESS), confirmed that all the candidates who had appeared for the exams had failed.
“We are quite surprised with the results and are analysing why every single candidate failed the exams,” he said, adding that the ministry is planning to hold talks with the Japanese government on the topic.
He further said that the government will request the Japanese government to simplify the skill test for Nepali job aspirants.

“There is no chance of review of the 2019 fall exams,” he said. “But the government will soon hold talks with the Japanese officials for the simplification of exam system targeting the exams for fall of 2020.”
According to him, the government will soon start accepting applications for the job openings for Japan for fall of 2020.
“We hope both the governments will follow the spirit of earlier signed memorandum of cooperation (MoC),” Dhungana said.
However, as per the MoC between Nepal and Japan, only the applicants that pass both the language and skill tests will be eligible to seek employment in Japan.
On March 25, the government had signed a MoC with Japan, paving the way for Nepali workers to travel to the world’s third largest economy for employment in 14 job categories.
As per the ministry, the government of Japan will allow Nepali workers to enter its job market at zero cost.
As per the agreement, the Japanese government will hire Nepali migrant workers in care-giving, building cleaning management, machine parts and tooling, industrial machinery, electronics, information and construction industries.
Other sectors where workers will be hired are shipbuilding and ship machinery, automobile repair and maintenance, aviation, accommodation, agriculture, fishery and aquaculture, manufacture of food and beverages and food service industry.
In December last year, the Japanese government had approved a law whereby Japanese firms will be allowed to employ blue-collar workers from eight countries, including Nepal. Japan plans to employ 345,000 foreign workers in five years.

Himalaya Airlines has resumed its commercial flights to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
After a long gap due to discontinuation of labour visa permit to Malaysia, the airline company has again resumed the flights from Monday.
The airline company had started operating flights to Kuala Lumpur from February 10, 2017. However, the flights were suspended from November last year.
According to the company, the first flight after resumption of the service departed from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) at 9:35 am (local time) on Monday for Kuala Lumpur International Airport carrying a total of 150 passengers.
With the resumption of flights in this sector, the airline company aims at promoting and capturing the outbound tourism potential of the region in Nepal. Likewise, the company has also said that with these new flights, the company aims to boost the connectivity of Nepal among Asia-Pacific region.

“We are excited to re-launch the direct flights between Kuala Lumpur and Kathmandu. We hope this will boost the significant commercial opportunity that exists for travellers in both the nations, as well as enhance trade and tourism,” said Vijay Shrestha, vice president of the airline company.
He further said that a strong demand from both the markets on the route and with the revised memorandum of understanding between the governments of Nepal and Malaysia hint at the possibility of increased passenger traffic in this sector.
Himalaya Airlines has also recently started commercial flights to two destinations in China.
Currently, the airline is flying to seven destinations, including Abu Dhabi, Dammam, Doha, Dhaka, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing, Guiyang with its fleet of three A320-214 series of narrow-body aircraft.

The Department of Transport Management (DoTM) has started printing smart driving licences through mass printer from today, giving hopes to thousands of service-seekers who are yet to get their smart vehicle driving permits.
Though the department imported the high-capacity printer in September to address the soaring demand of smart driving licences, operation of the printer was delayed citing technical reasons.
Interestingly, high-level officials from DoTM had to visit Italy to learn about the function of the printer and its operational procedure recently.
DoTM Director General Gogan Bahadur Hamal informed that the printer has been brought into operation from today.
“Thousands of service-seekers have been waiting for months to get their smart driving licences. By bringing the mass printer into operation, we aim to issue the smart driving permit to all service-seekers within April next year,” said Hamal.
As per him, the new mass printer has the capacity to print 450 smart cards in an hour. Though the printer will be operated for eight hours a day initially, Hamal informed that it will be used for more hours soon under different shifts.
“We’re planning to use the printer in three shifts of seven hours each, to print smart driving licences. We will be able to issue smart driving licences to all pending service-seekers within next four months,” added Hamal.

Due to inadequate printing capacity with the department, DoTM has not been able to issue smart driving licences to almost 800,000 service-seekers who had applied for renewal of old licence or had passed vehicle trial almost one year ago.
DoTM expects that the new mass printer will be able to print almost 8,000 driving licences in one day. With this, the department plans to print almost 240,000 smart driving licences in a month.
“In a few months, DoTM will be able to issue smart driving licences on the same day that a service-seeker passes vehicle trial,” Hamal claimed.

The committee formed to probe the allegations of misconduct by deputy governor of Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) Shiva Raj Shrestha has concluded that while he acted against the law in some instances, most of the mistakes made were due to systemic deficiencies/ weaknesses.
The committee, which was led by the central bank’s Board Director Sri Ram Poudyal, submitted its study report to the NRB board on Tuesday evening. Though the board was expected to submit the report to Ministry of Finance (MoF) today, MoF Spokesperson Uttar Kumar Khatri informed that the ministry is yet to receive the study report from NRB.
Shrestha had faced the probe for ‘various misconducts’, including his involvement in jeopardising the country’s financial stability, promoting money laundering and taking facilities unlawfully during his foreign trips, among others.
Shrestha had been suspended from his post at NRB when the investigation was launched.
“We have examined every allegation against Shrestha in detail and submitted our findings to the NRB board.
While he did break the rules in some cases, we found systemic errors were to be blamed for the majority of the charges levelled against him and he could not be held solely responsible for it,” informed a member of the probe committee seeking anonymity.
Shrestha was also accused of favouring telecom firm Ncell in a case that was earlier sub-judice at the Supreme Court and also of helping banks and financial institutions to conceal bad loans.
In the charges regarding Ncell, the probe committee has stated that no individual NRB official could be held accountable, as the process for allowing any multinational company to repatriate its profit requires approval from multiple government agencies before the final nod from the central bank.
However, during the investigation, the team uncovered evidences that proved Shrestha had assisted a few institutions that had breached financial stability in the country, as per the committee member.
The member, however, refused to divulge further details about the evidences and the institutions involved.
Meanwhile, the inquiry committee member also clarified that the report has not recommend any action against Shrestha. “We have just collected the facts on every charge against him and handed it to NRB. It is now up to the government, especially the Ministry of Finance, to decide whether or not action should be taken against Shrestha,” said the member.
Earlier, the Cabinet had charged Shrestha of being involved in jeopardising the country’s financial stability, promoting money laundering and taking facilities unlawfully during his foreign trips. Following this, the Ministry of Finance had tasked NRB to initiate a probe on Shrestha.
However, Shrestha has been refuting all allegations against him. Though he did not receive calls from The Himalayan Times today, he had earlier stated that all allegations against him were false and aimed at tarnishing his credibility amid the race for post of the governor.

The government has barred 37 health check-up institutions from providing medical examination service to migrant workers.
The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (MoLESS) has withdrawn their permit to conduct health check-ups and forwarded a letter informing about the move to the Department of Foreign Employment (DoFE).

As per MoLESS, the 37 institutions were not abiding by the provisions of Foreign Employment Guidelines (Fifth Amendment, 2008). As per amendment guidelines, the health check-up firms have to deposit Rs 500,000 as bank guarantee to continue their work. The ministry has stated that it has suspended the user name and password of the health institutions.
Pradeep Raj Adhikari, information officer at MoLESS, said the ministerial-level meeting has directed DoFE to bar the errant health institutions from providing service to migrant workers.
The firms include Helping Health Medical Centre, Venus Hospital, Kantipur Medical Centre, Navajeevan Hospital, Godawari Medicity Hospital, Annapurna Neuro Hospital, Chitwan Medical College, Om Hospital and Research Centre, Nobel Hospital, Siddhi Poly Clinic, among others.
Earlier, the government had finalised 122 health check-up centres to provide medical examinations of migrants going to Malaysia.
These centres have to receive authentication from the Malaysian government before being able to commence their service. However, some of the firms have also not deposited the bank guarantee to initiate health check-up service of migrant workers. “We are filtering such firms and will soon finalise the institutions that will be allowed to conduct health check-ups of migrants aspiring to go to Malaysia,” informed Adhikari.
The Malaysian government officials were scheduled to visit Nepal to finalise the health check-up firms in November, but the trip has been postponed and the next date has not been fixed yet. As per MoLESS, the Malaysian government has expressed dissatisfaction with the infrastructure of the short-listed institutions and they want to cut down the number of such firms.

The government is still looking for a way out to reclaim its ownership in Taragaon Regency Hotel Ltd even after the lawmakers had directed it to do so.
In April, a meeting of the International Relations and Labour Committee (IRLC) of the Federal Parliament had directed the Taragaon Development Committee to take back the government’s ownership from the private partners of the hotel. After IRLC found irregularities in share distribution of the hotel, it had directed the committee to exercise its authority to reclaim its share.
However, the committee is still struggling to reclaim its shares in the hotel.

Addressing the committee meeting held today, Prahalad Neupane, chairperson of the committee, expressed his dissatisfaction with the decreased share of the government in the hotel. “Taking back the rightful shares of the committee in Taragaon Regency is not possible without the help of the government,” he said, stressing that the committee must have 22.67 per cent shares in the hotel. Actually, the government owns 22.67 per cent share in the hotel, which has declined to nine per cent at the moment.
Furthermore, the committee is also seeking the government’s presence in the hotel operation committee.
Earlier, there was a provision of having three representatives from the government — chairperson of the committee, member of the committee and joint secretary of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation. However, Neupane said that currently only one representative — chairperson of the committee — from the government has been included in the hotel operation committee.
“The current provision of having only one government representative needs to be scrapped and the earlier provision must be implemented again,” he said, adding, “There is also a need to analyse the investment and profit share of Taragaon Development Committee in the hotel.” Neupane added that the committee is also not aware about the actual financial status of the hotel. Hence, he sought the government’s support for the reformation of ownership model of the hotel.
The meeting was held in the presence of Suresh Lal Shrestha, managing director of Hyatt Regency Kathmandu, CEO Arun Kumar Saraf, committee member Kamaladevi Shrestha and other members.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the government of Nepal today signed a $358 million loan agreement in total for four new projects.
The signing included a loan of $195 million to improve the highway section between Pokhara-Mugling, a $63 million loan in additional financing to improve flood management and river health in Nepal’s polluted Bagmati river basin, a $50 million loan to improve the livelihoods and increase incomes of small farmers in Nepal and a $50 million policy-based loan to support the government of Nepal’s reforms in agriculture and food safety.
The agreement to this effect was signed between Rajan Khanal, secretary at Ministry of Finance and ADB Country Director for Nepal Mukhtor Khamudkhanov.

“We thank ADB for its support to key sectors of the economy, including infrastructure, agriculture and rural finance. Similarly, ADB’s support to Nepal’s reform initiatives in important sectors is also highly appreciated,” said Khanal, adding all these are very important projects for Nepal and will support the government’s plan of a more inclusive sustainable development of the country.
Meanwhile, ADB Country Director Mukhtor said that the bank, over the years, has significantly scaled up its development assistance for Nepal which shows its partnership with government of Nepal continues to grow stronger.

“Nepal can further tap the opportunities of increased lending space provided by ADB with improved portfolio performance, and we appreciate the efforts taken by the government of Nepal in that direction,” he added.
Under the Mugling- Pokhara Highway Improvement Project, 81 km of the road will be widened to four lanes from Pokhara to Abukhaireni to meet increasing demand. Improvements will be made to the surfacing, structure, and drainage, with safety features such as crash barriers, and traffic and other warning light systems installed.
The additional funds for the Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project will finance an additional 5.75 kilometres of riverbank beautification in the heart of Kathmandu city, construct a wastewater treatment plant integrated into the landscape to treat a polluted tributary flowing into the Bagmati River, construct and equip a new regional building for the river basin office, and provide funds to train communities along the river on flood early warning systems.
The Food Safety and Agriculture Commercialisation Programme, comprised of a two-tranche, standalone policy-based loan, will improve food safety and quality monitoring systems in Nepal, particularly in enhancing the regulatory and institutional capacity for sanitary and phytosanitary monitoring.
The Rural Enterprise Financing Project will help improve rural enterprises’ and cooperatives’ access to finance, addressing the low appetite of formal financial institutions in financing rural enterprises. This will help to raise small farmers’ incomes and improve livelihood.

Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) is preparing to implement new laws to regulate and provide more safety measures for the country’s telecommunication sector. As per NTA, a draft of tower installation and operation regulation is under discussion.
In order to regulate the tower installation activities of the telecommunication service providers NTA has drafted the tower installation and construction regulation, said Min Prasad Aryal, spokesperson for NTA.

“The draft is awaiting the approval of NTA board,” he said. “The board members are revising some of the rules mentioned in the draft and as soon as it is approved it will be implemented.”
The new regulation will include areas of design and analysis of telecommunication towers, vulnerability assessment and risk assessment.
The major objective of implementing this regulation is to restrengthen and retrofit vulnerable towers for the convenience of consumers, Aryal added.
The draft of the regulation has also included rules about lightening protection, earthing and colour coding.
It also speaks of installing lights while installing tower as well as periodic maintenance, alteration in the construction and compliance of local authority requirement.
Aryal further said that the tower installation regulation has also been guided by other international telecommunication regulations. As per the new regulations, telecommunication service providers will be obliged to get NTA’s permission to instal mobile towers that are taller than seven metres.
Meanwhile, Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) safety regulation is also under approval phase. “Most of the people are unaware regarding safety precautions adopted by NTA in the telecommunication sector,” Aryal said. “The new regulation will also help to increase awareness among people regarding safety.”
As per him, the country has adopted Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMF) safe exposure limits from mobile towers under International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection.
Likewise, Nepal has also adopted practices of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for safe exposure limits from mobile handsets. “We have also purchased EMR measurement equipment which is currently being used to monitor mobile towers.”

The government, representatives of different political parties and locals of Gorkha and Dhading districts have reached a four-point agreement on the land compensation dispute of the 1,200-megawatt Budhigandaki Hydropower Project.
A meeting of the concerned stakeholders at the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation (MoEWRI) today, has agreed to implement the project as soon as possible and move forward together for a possible solution.
Last week, locals affected by the Budhigandaki project had enforced a bandh in Khahare and Arughat bazaars of Dhading, expressing dissatisfaction with the compensation fixed by the government in November. The locals had shut down government offices, educational institutions and businesses. Transportation was also disrupted during the protest.

Earlier, a joint meeting of the compensation fixing committees of both Gorkha and Dhading districts had fixed compensation by classifying the land in project-affected areas — Arughat, Khahare and Bhishalnagar of Dhading and Arughat and Arkhet of Gorkha — into seven categories.
Compensation had been fixed for 537 ropanis of land in Arughat and 72 ropanis in Arkhet in Gorkha and 245 ropanis in Khahare and 910 ropanis in Arughat and Bishalnagar in Dhading. As per the compensation fixed, the land in the affected areas will fetch between Rs 50,000 and Rs 700,000 per aana as compensation, depending on the location of the land.
While compensation for land along the main road has been fixed at up to Rs 700,000 in bazaar areas, compensation for a land plot without any road access has been fixed at Rs 50,000.
A total of 14 former VDCs of Gorkha and 13 VDCs of Dhading will be affected by the proposed project.
As per the four-point agreement, the concerned stakeholders have agreed to review the earlier land compensation fixing committee’s recommendation.
The meeting has agreed to make a proper masterplan to relocate and resettle affected locals in appropriate areas that are close to the earlier settlements.
Spokesperson of Nepal Communist Party (NCP), Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also a representative of Gorkha district, informed that MoLESS will soon forward the resettlement plan to the Cabinet after holding consultations with the affected people.
As per the project, they have distributed Rs 27 billion competition to the affected people so far.

34,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/apple-has-deep-concerns-that-ex-employees-accused-of-theft-will-flee-to-china/,"Apple Inc on Monday told a federal court it has “deep concerns” that two Chinese-born former employees accused of stealing trade secrets from the company will try to flee before their trials if their locations are not monitored.
At a hearing in US District Court for the Northern District of California, prosecutors argued that Xiaolang Zhang and Jizhong Chen should continue to be monitored because they present flight risks.
Federal prosecutors alleged Zhang worked on Apple‘s secretive self-driving car program and took files related to the project before disclosing that he was going to work for a Chinese competitor. Federal agents arrested Zhang last year at the San Jose airport as he was about to board a flight for China.
Prosecutors allege Chen took from Apple more than 2,000 files containing “manuals, schematics, diagrams and photographs of computer screens showing pages in Apple’s secure databases” with intent to share them. Agents arrested him in January at a train station on his way to San Francisco International Airport for a trip to China.
The men were each charged with one count of criminal trade secrets theft and pleaded not guilty. They were released on bail shortly after their arrests and have been monitored since then.
Attorney Daniel Olmos, who represents the men, said Monday that both had family reasons to visit China and had shown no signs of violating their pre-trial conditions so far.
Assistant US Attorney Marissa Harris argued that if either man fled to China, it would be difficult if not impossible for federal officials to secure their extradition for a trial. Three Apple employees sat in the courtroom to support prosecutors, including Anthony DeMario, a strategic adviser to Apple‘s global security group and veteran of the US Central Intelligence Agency.
Harris read Apple‘s statement to US District Judge Edward J. Davila in San Jose, California.
“Apple’s intellectual property is at the core of our innovation and growth,” the statement said. “The defendants’ continued participation in these proceedings is necessary to ensure a final determination of the facts, and we have deep concerns the defendants will not see this through if given the opportunity.
Zhan stood listening through an interpreter and was dressed in a white and blue dress shirt, black jeans and Nike sneakers. Olmos told Davila GPS monitoring was unnecessary to secure Zhang’s appearance at trial.
“This is not an espionage case,” Olmos said. The government “is not requesting detention, but they are requesting essentially indefinitely location monitoring.”
Harris said Zhang’s wife told federal agents that Zhang, who is a permanent US resident, attempted to flee to Canada when agents searched his home.
During that search, agents found a laptop at the bottom of a laundry hamper that they allege contained trade secrets about Ethernet technology from Zhang’s prior employer, chip supplier Marvell Technology Group Ltd, according to court documents.
Chen, a US citizen who emmigrated from China in 1991, listened to the proceedings through an interpreter and wore a dark blue hoodie. He has been under radiofrequency monitoring, which is less precise than GPS tracking.

CONFIDENTIAL MISSILE DOCUMENT
Prosecutors allege that Chen is a flight risk in part because they found documents from several other former employers – including General Electric Co and Raytheon Co – at Chen’s second residence in Maryland, where his wife and son live. Prosecutors said in court papers they found a 2011 document from Raytheon that they later determined was classified as “confidential,” the lowest level of sensitivity in the US government system.
“This document contains information relating to Raytheon’s work on the Patriot Missile program and was not (and is not) permitted to be maintained outside of Department of Defense secured locations,” prosecutors wrote.
Olmos, the defense attorney, said it was not a file, but a single paper document “sitting in a box somewhere” in Chen’s home.
Trial dates have not been scheduled. A hearing is scheduled for February.

During a meeting held today at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA), representatives from AOAN sought permission from the ministry to fly to Lukla from Kathmandu as the Manthali airport in Ramechhap district is being upgraded at present.
As per AOAN, tourists have been facing problems due to lack of facilities at Manthali airport. Until the government finishes upgrading the Manthali airport’s capacity, flights to Lukla should be operated from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), AOAN said. Likewise, the association has requested the minister to take the initiative to enhance road connectivity from Kathmandu to Ramechhap for the convenience of road travellers.
As the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has announced about operating regular flights to Lukla from Manthali, the maintenance of the airport is under way at the moment.
Likewise, AOAN has also requested the tourism minister to introduce a policy allowing them to operate flights in restricted areas.

“There are some restricted areas in the country where helicopters are not allowed to fly. So, considering the Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign, we have requested MoCTCA to allow choppers to go to those restricted areas at least during VNY 2020 campaign,” said Captain Rameshwor Thapa, president of AOAN.
Thapa further expressed his positive response towards the recommendations submitted to MoCTCA regarding airfare discounts for elderly passengers and other suggestions regarding airfare issues in the domestic aviation sector. “We will work together with the government and further discussions will be held to sort out the airfare issues,” he added.

37,https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/ownership-of-the-campaign-is-mantra-for-success-of-visit-nepal-2020/,"The country is gearing up to kick off the mega tourism campaign — Visit Nepal 2020 — in less than a month. While the government has set an ambitious goal to draw in two million tourists in the year and promote Nepal as a ‘lifetime experience’ destination, stakeholders are concerned about tepid preparations of the campaign and are sceptical about the target. Moreover, the falling contribution of tourism sector in the national economy has remained a major concern of the tourism fraternity. Against this backdrop, Sujan Dhungana and Arpana Ale Magar of The Himalayan Times spoke to tourism entrepreneur Yogendra Sakya, who was also the national coordinator of Visit Nepal 2011, to discuss the issues plaguing the tourism industry and his views on Visit Nepal 2020 campaign. Excerpts:
Everybody is talking about the country’s tourism prospects and challenges ahead of the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign. Where does the industry stand today?
The contribution of tourism in the national gross domestic product value, which at one point was almost 12 per cent, is currently just three per cent. Despite this, Nepal has managed to create much hullabaloo about its tourism, making it seem like the sector is the saviour of the national economy. However, statistics show that tourism sector is not the major driver of the national economy.
So, what happened to an industry that had such a major stake in the economy?
Back in the days when the tourism sector made almost 12 per cent contribution to the national economy, Nepal Airlines used to handle over 60 per cent of air travellers in Nepal. Today the national flag carrier handles less than four per cent of air travellers. Thus, the income that Nepal Airlines used to make from air travellers in the past is today being taken by foreign airlines. One of the major reasons behind dwindling stake of tourism in the national economy is the loss in airfare component.
Do you mean to say the tourism industry today is regressive?
I wouldn’t say it is regressive, but the problem facing the tourism industry in Nepal is lack of innovation. Innovation in the tourism sector is imperative to attract new visitors as well as lure people to keep coming back. We have some adventure products for which tourists come to Nepal. Such products need to be expanded and promoted. There is a big debate between quality and quantity in Nepal’s tourism sector. Nepal is not a controlled tourism destination as we are guided by an open market economy. Thus, there should not be any control in the rates and licences in the tourism sector. For example, there has been an exponential growth of hotels in Nepal in recent years.
But hoteliers are not lobbying against issuance of licences to new hotels. In an open economy, hotels do not fix the rate of their services, but consumers do. So, how should the country earn money from tourists?
It is by coming up with innovative ideas that encourage tourists to visit new places and spend on different tourism products. This is where Nepal is lacking. If we look at available innovative products — whether trekking, rafting, zip-flying, jungle safari or bungee jumping — all were initially started by some foreigners. These innovations were started many years ago. But these days there is dearth of such new innovative ideas and activities in Nepal, where tourists would love to go and spend. Tourism is not just about building big hotels and injecting huge investment.
Innovative ideas and activities are necessary to bring in tourists to the country and make them spend. But our tourism industry has been stuck in the rut, in a way.
I think the young generation has been stagnant. They have been unable to come up with innovative ideas that do not require a large sum of money. Not all creative ideas require a lot of funds. The government has announced its plans to increase the daily expense of foreign tourists to $80 from the current $45. We need concrete plans and a wide range of products to realise such plans.
Against this backdrop, the government has set the ambitious target to draw in two million tourists in 2020 and to increase the number of annual tourists to five million by 2030. How scientific are these goals?

In business, it is okay to have high hopes, but faith alone is not sufficient to achieve the set targets. For instance, the biggest setback for Nepal Airlines earlier was lack of adequate aircraft. Today it has comparatively higher number of aircraft, but it lacks the plans to fully utilise them.
We say the biggest setback in the tourism sector at present is lack of adequate infrastructure.
This issue is slowly being addressed with international airports being constructed in Bhairahawa and Pokhara that are expected to be completed soon. But what if these airports fail to generate air traffic as no one today is talking about how to operate them profitably? What if airline companies do not show any interest to operate from these airports?
Should that happen, our investment in these airports and hospitality industry will simply be wasted, thereby affecting the entire economy. So, just developing infrastructure is not enough. Operation plan of such infrastructure is crucial.
The success of any infrastructure depends on whether we are able to operate them in a full-fledged manner once it is ready.
Less than a month remains before the Visit Nepal 2020 tourism campaign is slated to begin. As you coordinated a similar tourism campaign in 2011, what are the changes that you have found in terms of readiness, plans and prospects of the campaign for next year?
Firstly, it is quite important for us to know why we observe such campaigns.
Generally, a country observes such tourism campaigns to give a strong message.
Nepal observed a number of such campaigns, but people remember only two — observed in 1998 and 2011. There were two reasons behind observing Visit Nepal 1998. Internally, agencies including Nepal Rastra Bank had been floating message that investing in tourism industry had no returns and the sector had no contribution to the national economy. Similarly, the Times magazine published an article on Nepal’s Shangri-La titled ‘Goodbye Shangri-La.’ The very brand of Shangri-La that we were banking on had been shaken in the international arena. As a result, the country’s tourism sector panicked. Hence, the Visit Nepal 1998 was observed to counter the aforementioned negative image of the country’s tourism both within the country and abroad. In 2011, the inflow of tourists in Nepal was coming down drastically due to long insurgency and political instability. So, the Visit Nepal 2011 was organised to bring everyone together for tourism. There is much talk about Visit Nepal 2020, which is very good.
Now efforts should be made to assure that everybody takes ownership of this campaign.
From people to the government, they should play the necessary role to make this campaign successful. Hoteliers should ensure quality service to tourists, while the government should ensure necessary infrastructure. Success of Visit Nepal 2020 tourism campaign depends on how everybody is mobilised for this campaign. Ownership of the campaign is the mantra for success of Visit Nepal 2020.
Compared to 1998 and 2011, this is the best time to promote tourism, as the country is stable and the capacity of Nepal Airlines has been enhanced. But confusion today lies in the slogan of the campaign for next year — Lifetime Experience.
Undeniably, the slogan is good, but it lacks clarity on what it means. Campaigners are lacking clarity on the slogan. Any campaign should give one message at one time. Regarding the Visit Nepal 2020, people are quite confused about the message that the campaign wants to give. Similarly, tourism policies are crucial to promote tourism. While we say ‘atithi devo bhawa’ (tourists are gods), our policies discriminate against them and we only treat them as money generating machines. I feel such policies should be changed so that foreigners are encouraged to visit Nepal.

The Australian government has offered Australia Awards Scholarships to 23 emerging leaders of Nepal to study in Australia’s educational institutions in 2020.
Of the 23 awardees, 14 are from public sector. One applicant with disability has also been selected for the scholarship. “Award scholars were selected through competitive process, taking into account their academic and professional achievements, leadership qualities and most importantly their potential to drive positive change in support of Nepal’s national development,” said Peter Budd, Australia’s Ambassador to Nepal at an event organised to bid farewell to the scholars in Kathmandu today.
According to the Embassy of Australia in Nepal, Australia Awards scholars gain quality education in Australia, advance their knowledge and build networks across a range of areas, including economic development, education, gender equality, disability inclusiveness and social inclusion, governance and water resource management. Many alumni of the Australia Awards go on to hold senior positions in business and government after returning home.
More than 1,000 Nepalis have pursued studies and research in Australia under the Australia Awards Scholarships, said the embassy.

The programme was organised on August 16 and 17 at Kanjirowa National Secondary School in collaboration with Robotics Association of Nepal (RAN) and Nepal Robotics Project, USA, according to a press release issued by the organiser.

The main aim of the training was to promote STEM — focusing on both the practical and theoretical aspects of robotics in Nepal, reads the statement. As many as 28 participants from 18 schools were involved in learning about the fundamentals of STEM education, drone making, aerodynamics, principles of flying, among others.
Kapil Dev Regmi, Chairman of Kanjirowa School, highlighted that Nepal’s education system required a practical approach to encourage the students for innovation and research rather than promoting rote learning. He was hopeful that such training will be given priority in more schools in future.
Participating teachers had an opportunity to interact with one another and share their experiences on the condition of STEM education in Nepal. The programme was led by some innovative engineers having extensive knowledge of robotics and latest technological advancements in the field.
Michael Kronmiller from Nepal Robotics Project, US, Aliyah Pandoliff from Kashmir World Foundation, US, and Prof Sandra Magnus, former NASA Scientist and Astronaut sent messages for the success of the programme and expressed their interests to work further with Kanjirowa in STEM education in the future too.
Theodore Kronmiller, former US ambassador has been an inspiration to Kanjirowa in its STEM education, according to the statement.

42,https://thehimalayantimes.com/education/government-bars-pupils-from-pursuing-non-academic-courses-abroad/,"Kathmandu, June 12
Nepali students, who wish to pursue non-academic courses, like vocational education or language courses in countries such as Australia and Japan, will not be allowed to do so from now onwards, thanks to the government’s radical move aimed at curtailing the rights of high school graduates to make choices. What’s more, students who have not completed Grade XII will not be allowed to study abroad.
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology published a notice today stating that students who have completed Grade XII or equivalent will be given ‘no objection letters’ to study abroad only if they intend to pursue academic courses of bachelor’s level or above.
Students cannot study abroad without obtaining ‘no objection letters’. These letters are also essential to get foreign currency exchange facility.

“We will issue no objection letters even to those who wish to pursue technical and vocational education, language courses and academic bridge courses, which are similar to language courses. But those students will have to provide evidence to substantiate they will get enrolled in a university to pursue academic courses after completing vocational or language courses,” said MoEST Under-secretary Maheshwor Sharma.
This move will largely affect students intending to study in Australia. Many Australia-bound Nepali students join technical and vocational institutions. This is common among those pursuing nursing.
Technical and vocational education, which is a non-academic course, generally prepares students for the job market, as it is designed by conducting studies on the needs of several industries. Countries such as Australia, Germany and Switzerland are well known for their technical and vocational education courses.
The latest move will also hit students who leave for Japan to pursue language courses. Many of them have not even passed Grade XII.
The latest provision introduced by the government clearly states that students will not be given permission to study abroad if they have not completed Grade XII. At present, not many students prefer to study abroad before passing Grade XII, but the new provision prevents parents who can afford to, or students who wish to, from doing so.
“The new provisions were introduced on the basis of the law which states that students can only get enrolled in foreign institutions if they intend to pursue higher education,” said Sharma. He added, “We now define higher education as tertiary education and not education attained in Grade XI and XII.” Earlier, the government used to define education provided in grades XI and XII as higher education. This has changed after the government started recognising grades XI and XII as a part of high school.
“The government should not have introduced such a provision without holding consultation with stakeholders. This blanket provision will not do good to students planning to study abroad. Students should be allowed to go abroad if they can attain quality education,” said Kedar Bhakta Mathema, former vice-chancellor of Tribhuvan University.

Loughlin, who starred in the television sitcom “Full House,” and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli filed papers in federal court in Boston waiving their personal appearances at an arraignment hearing and asking to have not guilty pleas entered on their behalf.
They are among 50 people accused of participating in a massive scheme that allowed wealthy parents to use cheating and $25 million in bribes to help their children secure spots at well-known universities like Yale, Georgetown and USC.
California college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer pleaded guilty in March to charges that helped parents facilitate cheating on college entrance exams and bribed coaches at universities to falsely present their children as athletic recruits.
Prosecutors allege that Loughlin (54) and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USC’s crew team, even though they did not row competitively, to help them gain admission.
Loughlin and Giannulli provided Singer photographs of their daughters in order to create fake athletic profiles for them, which a USC athletics official in exchange for bribes then used to support recruiting them, prosecutors said.
The couple and several other parents were originally charged in March with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Prosecutors secured an indictment on April 9 that included an additional charge of conspiring to commit money laundering.
Several other parents charged alongside Loughlin and Giannulli also filed papers seeking to waive appearing at an arraignment and have not guilty pleas entered for them. A federal magistrate judge granted their requests on Monday.
In all, 33 parents have been charged in the college admissions scandal. Of those, 13 have agreed to plead guilty, including “Desperate Housewives” TV star Felicity Huffman. She is scheduled to plead guilty on May 21.

ULYSSES, KANSAS: A 16-year-old Kansas boy will soon earn his high school diploma — and a few days later he’ll travel to Harvard to collect his bachelor’s degree.
Ulysses High School senior Braxton Moral will attend both commencement ceremonies in May, becoming the only student to successfully pursue a four-year high school degree and a bachelor’s degree from Harvard at the same time, The Hutchinson News reported .
Harvard has changed the rules, Braxton’s father Carlos Moral said, so his son will “the one and only” reaching that milestone. Braxton Moral will be 17 when he gets his diplomas.
Carlos Moral said they began to realize their son was special when he was in the third grade.
“They told us: ‘You need to do something. He’s not just gifted. He’s really, really gifted,’” he said.
Braxton Moral skipped the fourth grade.
The Ulysses school district allowed him to take some high school classes while he was still in middle school. Before high school he took a class offered at Fort Hays State University. Then he was admitted into Harvard.
Braxton Moral simultaneously studied at the high school and the Harvard Extension School. The program typically serves adults who work and can’t attend classes on campus full time.
Ulysses High School math teacher Patsy Love served as the proctor for the Harvard program, administering Moral’s tests in Kansas. Moral spent the summer before his junior year at Harvard’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
“We constantly are monitoring Braxton to make sure he is not too overwhelmed,” said Julie Moral, Braxton Moral’s mother. “No achievement is worth him being unhappy.”
Braxton Moral is on track to graduate from the Bachelor of Liberal Arts program, with a major government and a minor in English, said Harry Pierre, associate director of communications for Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education.
Braxton Moral said he hopes to attend Harvard Law School next.
“Politics is end game for me,” he said, though he’s still too young to vote.

BOSTON: The latest crop of US Rhodes scholars has more women than any other single class, and almost half of this year’s recipients of the prestigious scholarship to Oxford University in England are either immigrants or first-generation Americans, the Rhodes Trust announced Sunday.
Among the 32 winners is Harvard University senior Jin Park, the first recipient covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation.
Park, 22, of the New York City borough of Queens, arrived from South Korea with his parents when he was 7, studied molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, and founded a nonprofit to help undocumented students apply to college.
He hopes to become an immigrant advocate, saying it’s important for him to use the opportunity to better others, not just himself.
“When you grow up as an undocumented immigrant in America, that understanding that your talents don’t really belong to you in the traditional sense, that you have to share the fruits of your labor with others, that’s just something you learn,” Park said.
Alaleh Azhir, a 21-year old senior at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, emigrated from Iran when she was 14 — and is also one of 21 female scholars named Sunday. The New York City resident hopes eventually to become a doctor and will study women’s and reproductive health at Oxford.
“I’m just a passionate advocate for women in general and that’s mostly because of my background,” she said. “I thought that the way I could advocate for women could be by advocating for their health.”
At Chapman University in Southern California, Vidal Arroyo, 21, reflected on his unlikely path to becoming his school’s first Rhodes Scholar.
“As a Latino, a first-generation college student, and a train commuter to college, winning this scholarship means so much to me because it sheds hope for students from backgrounds like my own who have to overcome multiple barriers in pursuit of a higher education and a better future,” said Arroyo, who plans to study engineering science at Oxford.
And Eren Orbey, a 23-year-old senior at Yale University in Connecticut, whose parents emigrated from Turkey, hopes studying at Oxford will bring greater “context and clarity” to his writing. He is a regular contributor to The New Yorker magazine and is working on a book about his father, who was slain in Ankara when he was just 3, and the killer.
“I’m interested in studying the ethics of revenge and forgiveness,” Orbey said Sunday by email. “I think that our culture and media coverage often condescend to immigrants and survivors of trauma. In my writing, I hope to recast tragedy and strife as occasions for growth and heroism.”
The US Rhodes scholars join a separate, international group of scholars representing more than 60 countries.
Rhodes Scholarships provide all expenses for at least two years of study at Oxford. They were created in 1902 in the will of Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman and Oxford alum who was a prime minister of the Cape Colony in present-day South Africa.

LONDON: Football legend David Beckham has visited Indonesia – where one in three children have been physically attacked in school – to see how his charity, the 7 Fund, is combating bullying.
The A-list celebrity and former England captain launched the fund to protect the world’s most vulnerable youngsters in 2015 with the United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF).
“I feel very proud to see how my 7 Fund is helping UNICEF tackle bullying and violence in schools in Indonesia, and is ultimately keeping children, especially girls, safe in their schools so they can continue their education,” he said.
Bullying and violence are among the biggest worries for young people in Indonesia, with more than 1 in 5 teens aged 13 to 15 – or 18 million students – experiencing it, leading to mental health problems and school dropouts, UNICEF said.
The 7 Fund teaches children who have been bullied and former bullies to educate others and trains teachers to keep children safe. Bullying has been reduced by almost a third among the 7,000 children who have taken part in pilot programmes, it said.
“I spent time with an amazing young girl – Sripun – who was voted by her peers to take part in an anti-bullying programme to help stop violence in schools,” Beckham said in a statement.
“This has increased her confidence and she’s hopeful that other students won’t have to go through the same bullying experience she did.”
The fund — named after Beckham’s lucky number on his England and Manchester United shirts — focuses on children at risk of violence, abuse or disease.
Beckham, a father of four, has said that he hopes his own children will be proud of his work with the 7 Fund, which also has projects in Indonesia, Nepal, Uganda and El Salvador.

Vice-chairman of National Planning Commission Swarnim Wagle has said that setting the educational agenda has been a great challenge in the country.
Speaking at the 18th Annual General Meeting of Educational Journalist Group here today, he said the government had to give priority to education.
“The quality of education should be improved now that the local levels are responsible for handling and managing school education,” he said.
Around 40 per cent of budget is being sent to the local levels and preparations are also on to hand over different projects currently being handled by different non-governmental organisations to the local levels.
Similarly, former education minister Dhaniram Paudel said despite the handover of the education system to the local levels, the Ministry of Education, Department of Education and district education offices should handle the education system.
Madhu Prasad Regmi, secretary at the Ministry of Education, said 23 responsibilities of the education sector had been given to the local levels without hampering the educational system.
As all the basic and secondary schools are being handled by the local levels it will be easy to manage resources for the education sector from local resources, he added.
On the occasion, Mathura Yadav principal of Tribeni Primary School, Rupandehi, and Devi Khadka Pokhrel, member of School Management Committee of Kamala Secondary School, Sindhuli were honored at the programme.

Kathmandu
Teachers are guides for students providing students with valuable knowledge, which help students to excel in their studies as well as life in general. Teachers with decades of teaching experience in various colleges share important tips.

Study on a regular basis
Teachers suggest that students should give regular time to their studies. However, they say there is no fixed hours that they should set aside.
“Regular reading is a must,” says Bharat Kumar Bhattarai, who has 30 years of experience as a Nepali lecturer. He suggests students to prepare notes right from the beginning of the academic year and go through it regularly.
Saroj Pyakurel, Accounting lecturer in different colleges in Kathmandu, says that there is no fixed hours that students should give to their studies. However, according to Pya-kurel, who has 14 years of teaching experience, students should give as much time as they can daily, in which they would be able to understand the lessons taught every day. “Students themselves should decide how much time they should give regularly on a daily basis so they understand the lessons,” he suggests. He stresses that during holidays too, students should set aside at least three hours for revisions.
Educationist Prof Dr Bidya Nath Koirala says that the time students should give to their studies depends upon their nature. Some students learn fast and some slowly, so students themselves should find out how much time they should give to their studies according to their learning ability.

Tips for exam preparation
Educators suggest that students should go through all the topics of a subject in order to obtain good marks in exams.  Nepali lecturer Bhattarai suggests students to divide time according to the importance and marks of the topics. “For the exams you should not study selecting a few topics, but study all the topics in the text with the intention to understand each topic thoroughly.”
He says that students who select only few a topics to study for exams will not be able to do well. “Every topic in course is inter-related, and if students do not understand earlier topics, they will not be clear about the next chapter too,” he opines.
He also suggests students to prepare for exams by noting down important points of each chapter. Besides this, he says that students, who prepare notes from the beginning, will score good marks in exams as they will have already gained a deep knowledge of each chapter. However, he suggests avoiding using guides books and guess papers. “Students depending upon guide books and guess papers will ruin themselves,” he informs as “guide book writers are not responsible ones; they take it as a job and they are not responsible towards students’ progress.”

Be proactive
Students should not only depend upon the teachers’ notes but should also work on their own by studying reference materials, books from the library and doing online researches, as per the teachers.
“Teachers are limited within the circle of their knowledge and education, so students should also study and prepare from books by various writers. This will broaden their knowledge,” says Bhattarai.
Pyakurel also argues that students should not only depend upon their teachers and course books. “Students can benefit much from YouTube and Google as thousands of study materials are available there.”
He further says, “The mind is always motivated by desire, so students should also research on issues in which their interests lie.”

Questioning mind
Prof Dr Koirala says that raising questions is the most important feature of a learner. He says that students should always have questions in their mind and ask questions to themselves in order to learn. On any topic or issue, a student should ask questions: Why it is so? How did it happen? What is the mechanism behind it? How is it related with me? Raising such questions will make a student understand topics analytically, he says.

Clear vision
Sociology lecturer Uttam Prasad Devkota says that students should have a goal. Devkota has 13 years of experience in teaching.  “It is not that you study BBA because you completed your plus two level. Students should have a clear vision about their field of interest and about what they want to be in future,” points out Devkota. He adds that the students should not be limited to their course but should broaden their horizon by gaining knowledge on social, cultural, political and economic conditions of the country and people. Students should always notice what is happening in their society and country. This will make them explore the possibility of the current subject they are studying. They should not only prepare to get good results in exams but think of study and learning as a regular process, Devkota adds.

Kathmandu
Teej, one of the greatest festivals for Hindu women, is here. Students also celebrate this festival, and even if they don’t, they are affected by the festivities surrounding it as people from their friend circle or family members celebrate it. Sharing their views about this festival, they admit that the study environment college and homes is affected by the festival.
In celebratory mood
For most students the best aspect of this festival is that it strengthens the bond between female members in society as they meet and share their feelings with each other. They add that the singing, dancing and the celebration part of the festival is what they enjoy the most.
Nisha Khatiwada, a resident of Kapan and a Vth semester student of Bachelor of Public Health at the Karnali College of Health Sciences in Battisputali, says that it is fascinating to see women in red, dancing and singing folk songs on streets, going to temples in a holy and fasting mood.
Class environment
Rebecca Maghariya, a IVth year student of Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) at the Shanker Dev Campus in Putalisadak, says that as their college has no uniform, students come wearing red and green, or colourful kurta and also with mehendi on their hands two weeks prior to Teej. Maghariya is from Kailali and is currently residing in Thankot.
Maghariya’s classmate Pratiksha Gautam says Teej becomes a subject of all talks among classmates. Gautam hails from Rukum and is residing in Dillibazar. According to her, kind of clothes to wear and songs to sing during Teej become the main topics of talk in class starting a few weeks before the festival.
Effects on study
The students also admit they are distracted from their studies during the festival due to many reasons.
Neeru Poudel, a IVth Year BBS student at Shanker Dev Campus, says that the festival affected her when she was studying in BBS Ist Year as the board exam was on the same day. She was distracted from her studies as there was a celebratory environment at her home. According to her, this year too the BBS Ist Year board exams were scheduled on Teej but was postponed due to floods in Tarai. Poudel is from Syangja and residing in New Baneshwor. She says that music and other noise from Darr events at a nearby complex could be heard from her room. This disturbs her while doing her college assignments.
Umesh Bhakt Joshi, a IInd Year student of Bachelor of Law (LLB) at the Nepal Law Campus at Pradarshanimarg, says that around 50 per cent of female classmates in his class do not attend class from around two weeks prior to Teej. Joshi, from Bajhang and residing in Kirtipur, says almost all his female classmates are absent from Darr eating day till Rishi Panchami. He opines that as half the number of students remain absent, their lecturers show no interest in teaching and usually postpone classes for a week. There is also less possibility of female lecturers holding classes on those days, informs Joshi, adding that student unions in the college have organised Darr programme for students this year too as in previous years.
Shanta Bahadur Tamang of the Nepal Law Campus however, says that Teej celebration should not affect students regarding their studies as it depends upon students themselves on how to manage time. According to him, if some days are to be spent in celebrations, students should study those chapters early on or give extra time to the same after the festival ends.
Superstition
Apart from these aspects of Teej, Khatiwada said she does not believe bathing and performing other rituals on Rishi Panchami will purify women and earn them penance from the so-called mistakes they may have committed being and making others impure during periods. Such superstitions push women to an inferior position in society, she adds.

67,https://thehimalayantimes.com/education/the-hostel-life/,"Hasana Lawaju talks to college students who are living in hostels as they pursue their studies and finds out why students find it advantageous to stay in one


Hostel provides a good environment for studies — serious students take the best advantage while living in hostels. While there are the fun and challenges of living in a hostel, these are also the best places for students to live while pursuing their higher studies. Most students agree that they are motivated to study while saving their time as they attend their colleges while living in hostel.
Conducive study environment
Some students find hostel environment motivational to concentrate in their studies, especially during exams.  “Every student staying in a hostel usually has exams at the same time, and thus all are studying during that time,” says Bishwadeep Tamang, a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering, Bhaktapur. Tamang, who hails from Sankhuwasabha, is staying at Hostel Libali — a private hostel in Bhaktapur.
Tamang’s classmate as well as roommate Manish Dhakal echoes a similar view — “when a  friend is studying for exams at hostel, a competitive spirit develops among other friends, and as a result everyone is motivated to study”.
The motivation to study comes from seniors at her hostel for Manisha Khadka, Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) VIth Semester student.  Khadka, who studies at Padmakanya Multiple Campus, Baghbazar and stays in the college’s Pragya Chhatrawas, shares, “When I see my seniors — especially Master’s level students — studying sincerely, I am inspired to study properly.”
Living in a hostel with classmates becomes advantageous, especially when one misses a class or does not understand the topic taught in the classroom.  “Whenever I do not understand any topic taught by the teachers, I can consult my roommates or other friends in the hostel who have a better understanding of the topic,” points out Kshitij Dahal, BE (Civil) IInd Year student at Khwopa College of Engineering. Dahal also resides in Hostel Libali.
However, Sharmila Upadhyaya staying at Padma Girls Hostel in Pulchowk, has a different experience. Initially, when she started living in the hostel three-and-a-half years ago, it was difficult for her to adjust because she was not used to studying in group. But with time, she has gotten used to it.
Upadhyaya, BE (Computer Engineering) VIIIth Semester student at the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk,  shares her hostel offers a good environment for students as it “only selects students after checking their academic performances”.
Life made easier
Khadka’s hostel is next to her college premises. “It takes me only a few minutes to reach my hostel. So, my time is not wasted in travelling,” says Khadka, who hails from Butwal. Living near the college, she claims to utilise most of her time for studies.
Had Dhakal, whose house is in Kapan, chosen to commute to his college in Bhaktapur from his home “I would have spent at least four hours daily just travelling in bus”. Thanks to his decision to stay in a hostel, he is able to save valuable time.
The students also need not cook or do laundry and cleaning as most hostels provide students with food, laundry and other services.

“We do not need to cook, wash dishes or clothes, and it is convenient for us,” Tamang shares.
Along with that other facilities are available in the hostels. For instance, the three-and-a- half storey Pragya Chhatrawas has made one study hall available in each floor for students along with Wi-Fi facility, as per Geeta Tandukar, a third class officer at General Administration Division of the Padmakanya Multiple Campus.
Kutumba Boys Hostel, Jawalakhel receives students’ report cards from their respective colleges. “We wake the students up early in the morning, monitor their studies, talk to the parents if their children are not concentrating in their studies or have poor academic performances,” hostel coordinator Bandana Khatri reveals.
More than studies
Be it a hostel run by the college or a private one, most make students’ academics the priority. But they also provide opportunities for students to have fun. As such, the occasional celebrations in hostels are the best moments for students like Khadka. They celebrate Teachers’ Day where they offer treats to their teachers and also celebrate birthday of their hostel warden, as per Khadka.
Hostel wardens too support the students in such endeavours. Rakesh Machamasi, Warden of Hostel Libali informs, “We prepare delicacies like Dahi Chiura, Khir, Yomari et cetera  on different occasions for the hostel students and we all celebrate together. Our students find such celebrations interesting.”
Dissatisfaction 
Most students agree that hostels provide them with a good study environment. However, they have some dissatisfaction too, mostly about the food served.
“Sometimes, the food served by our hostel is not hygienic. At times I have found insects and hair in the food, though it does happen always,” complains Khadka.
Dahal has some objection with the meat-policy of his hostel. “Our hostel serves meat every Wednesday. But if I do not feel like eating on that day and want to have meat on some other day, that is not possible,” Dahal argues.
But Upadhyaya puts forth a different opinion. “It is not what we want to eat, but what is available. If we do not eat properly, no one in the hostel will convince us to eat. As such habits like not eating on time  can even affect our health. So, rather than complaining, we should learn to take care ourselves,” she opines.

68,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/anna-karina-the-icon-of-french-new-wave-cinema-dies-at-79/,"PARIS: Anna Karina, the French New Wave actress who became an icon of the cinema in the 1960s and was the muse of Jean-Luc Godard, has died. She was 79.
The French culture minister announced her death on Twitter on Sunday. French media said that the Danish-born Karina had cancer and died Saturday.

”Her look was the look of the New Wave. It will remain so forever,” Culture Minister Franck Riester tweeted.
“Anna Karina radiated. She magnetized the entire world,”‘ Riester said, adding that ”French cinema has lost one of its legends.”
Karina made seven films with Godard, her partner at the time, including the 1961 “Une Femme Est Une Femme” (A Woman is a Woman), in which she played a femme fatale. For that, she received the best actress award at the Berlin Film Festival. Other cult Godard movies starring Karina included the 1962 “Vivre Sa Vie'” (Live Your Life) and the 1965 “Pierrot Le Fou.”
Karina captured film-goers with her large blue doe eyes and acting and singing talents.
The French New Wave broke with traditional cinematic conventions to create a fresh approach to making movies, in keeping with the free-spirited times.
Godard wasn’t the only director with whom Karina worked. Jacques Rivette’s 1966 film “La Religieuse” (The Nun), adapted from the 18th-century French novel by Diderot, was initially banned. The story of a young woman forced into the convent by her mother, who had given birth out of wedlock, was revived in a restored version and presented at the 2018 Cannes film festival.
Born Hanne Karin Blarke Bayer in Denmark, she initially modelled and sang in cabarets before coming to France. She was reportedly discovered, and renamed, by Coco Chanel, then discovered by Godard.
Karina also worked, among other illustrious directors, with Luchino Visconti.
In a bold undertaking at the time, the actress later got behind the camera to make her own movie in 1973, “Vivre Ensemble” (Living Together).
Films that Karina has appeared in will be shown on the silver screen again with a retrospective of Godard starting next month at the Cinemateque, a noted film institution in France which she had frequented.

KATHMANDU: After successfully performing in Brisbane, Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart, Nepal’s famous folk-rock band, Nepathya, captivated the full-house audience at Big Top Auditorium in Luna Park of Sydney, Australia, on Saturday.
Performing for the fifth time in Sydney, Nepathya, entertained the audience with their mix of old and new songs with a great effect of the latest technology at the sold-out auditorium this weekend.
With this show, Sydney hosted Nepathya’s concert for the record fifth time. Nepathya has already performed more than five times in Kathmandu, Pokhara, Butwal, Chitwan, Hetauda and Dhangadhi within Nepal.
As the show went on, band’s lead singer and social activist Amrit Gurung said, “I still remember our first concert ten years ago as there were fewer Nepalis living in Sydney. However, during the last decade, Nepali diaspora has migrated looking for opportunities all over the globe.”
“Nepal would be a prosperous nation if it could do enough to stop the flow of brain-drain in the near future,” Amrit Gurung added.
“I see future in youths like you, who have gained knowledge, skills and experience in a foreign land, to transform the course of the nation like ours. Although our predecessors failed to create opportunities for us, we should be able for the next generation in Nepal, “Amrit Gurung shared.
As usual, Gurung was supported by Dhurba Lama on drums, Suraj Thapa on keyboards, Subin Shakya on bass guitar, Niraj Gurung on guitars and Shanti Raymajhi on madal.
After the Sydney show, Nepathya’s concert entourage will head to final stop-over in Melbourne to perform on December 23, the band said.
Nepathaya is currently touring Australia for the fifth time with new music series.

72,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/lemonade-by-beyonce-is-named-the-aps-album-of-the-decade/,"NEW YORK: The top 15 albums of the decade by Associated Press Music Editor Mesfin Fekadu:

Beyoncé, “Lemonade”: At the beginning of this decade, Beyoncé was already the greatest singer of her generation. She won a record six Grammys in a single night, had women AND MEN “oh-oh-oh’ing” to the fun sound of “Single Ladies” and continued to be a beast of a performer. But somehow Superwoman — shoot, she’s Superman, too! — found a way to do more: Like a boss she launched her own company, Parkwood Entertainment, and really took the bull by the horns of her career. In 2011, she released the R&B adventure “4,” featuring classics like “Countdown,” “Love on Top,” “Party,” “End of Time,” “I Care” and “I Miss You.” Three years later — in surprise form — came “Beyoncé,” her bold, audacious and daring album that showcased a new side of Beyoncé: Goodbye was the girl who cared about topping the charts, and born was an artist, a true storyteller, a grown woman. Somehow, she topped herself again with “Lemonade,” which still tastes as good as it did when it was released in 2016. The usually private Beyoncé bares her soul on the album, singing about a troubled relationship, black pride and motherhood in a brave way. Lyrically, she’s on point and honest over beats and sounds that range from rap to rock to country and pop. “Who the (expletive) do you think I am,” she brashly asks on “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” which co-stars Jack White. The answer: the greatest of all time.
Rihanna, “Anti”: Something was in the water in 2016: Beyoncé delivered “Lemonade” and Rihanna gave us the best album of her career with “Anti.” Rihanna had been moving like the Energizer Bunny since releasing her first album in 2005. She also put out albums in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 — showing that she was a singer who knew how to pick a hit, record it and make it sound better than any other artist could. But she took four years to create “Anti,” and the time was used wisely. No need to hit the skip button on this album as Rihanna shows her sultry side on “Kiss It Better,” her twerk side on “Work” and her vocal chops on “Love on the Brain.” Her hard work, work, work, work, work, work has truly paid off.


Beyoncé, “Beyoncé”: See earlier entry.
Adele, “21”: Back in my day — well in 2010 — record labels sent albums months in advance, and in November 2010 I received Adele’s “21.” Everything else around had to be turned off. I was sucked in. Months later, so was the world. THE ENTIRE WORLD. Adele was impressive on her 2008 debut, especially on “Hometown Glory,” but with “21” she went deep, too deep, she was rolling in the deep! Literally. Each song made you feel something — sad, lonely, bouncy, fired up, calm, angry, lost. And nine years later, each song sounds as classic as they did at first listen, especially “Turning Tables,” “Set Fire to the Rain” and the incomparable “Someone Like You.”
Kendrick Lamar, “good kid, m.A.A.d city”: All of Kendrick Lamar’s albums released this decade have been masterpieces, including the 2011 independent release “Section.80” as well as the major-label projects “To Pimp a Butterfly” and “DAMN.,” which won him the Pulitzer Prize for music as he made history as the first non-classical or jazz artist to win the prestigious prize. Lamar has profoundly mixed his poetry with hip-hop, jazz, soul, funk and African music to create songs that tackle blackness, street life, police brutality, survival and self-worth. And with 2012’s “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” this great kid immediately raised the bar not in only in hip-hop, but in music period, forcing his peers to do better and try harder.
HAIM, “Days Are Gone”: The sister trio HAIM reached perfection on their debut album. Hit play. And that is all.
SZA, “Ctrl”: SZA is masterful and introspective on her confessional debut album, which follows a young woman going through life and the turbulent experiences that come with it, from dating dusty boys to dealing with self-doubt.


Janelle Monáe, “The ArchAndroid”: According to contemporary pop folklore, Janelle Monae arrived on the pop landscape from another planet, and boy do we need more artists from that sphere to land here now. On the beautifully theatrical “The ArchAndroid,” she brilliantly paints the picture of an android, Cindi Mayweather, who finds out she is the chosen one and is trying to figure out how to handle her newfound mission. The versatile album has so many highpoints, including the Fela-flavored “Dance or Die,” the playful “Tightrope,” the groovy “Locked Inside” and the addictive “Faster.”
Katy Perry, “Teenage Dream”: I’ll quote the opening line of my 2010 “Teenage Dream” review, which came before the album matched the record Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” set by launching five No.1 hits: “Katy Perry’s new CD is like a magical slot machine: Select any song and you’ll hear a hit.”
Bruno Mars, “24K Magic”: Bruno Mars released three epic albums this decade, but “24K Magic” was a whole mood.
Solange, “A Seat at the Table”: Solange’s art-piece of an album will move you to think, and sing along, at the same time.
Sam Smith, “In the Lonely Hour”: Unrequited love ruled Sam Smith’s debut album, introducing the world to a piercing voice that is brave and honest.
Nas, “Life Is Good”: Nas is still the best rapper alive. Don’t at me.
Taylor Swift, “1989”: After dabbling in it on “Red,” former country singer Taylor Swift hopped, skipped and jumped into the pop music world with “1989,” an adventurous album full of hits, hits and more hits.
Kacey Musgraves, “Golden Hour”: With timeless songs like “Space Cowboy,” “Butterflies,” “Slow Burn” and “Lonely Weekend,” Kacey Musgraves proved to not just be golden, but grand.

74,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/frozen-2-leads-box-office-again-playmobil-flops/,"NEW YORK: “Frozen 2” blanketed multiplexes for the third straight weekend, continuing its reign at No. 1 with $34.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.
The Walt Disney Co animated sequel has already grossed $919.7 million worldwide. It will soon become the sixth Disney release this year to cross $1 billion, a record sure to grow to seven once “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” hits theatres later this month. Early next week, Disney will cross $10 billion at the global box office this year.

But the weekend overall at the box office was yet another disappointing one for the movie industry. A handful of under-performing releases and a relatively thin wide-release schedule hasn’t helped the 5.6% slide in domestic ticket sales from last year, according to data firm Comscore.
This weekend produced an outright flop in “Playmobil: The Movie,” the week’s only new wide release. The STX Films release was never expected to do well, but it bombed so thoroughly that it will rank among the worst-performing wide-releases ever. It grossed $668,000 in 2,337 venues, giving it a per-theatre average of just $286.
A handful of companies combined to produce the $75 million French film, including Wild Bunch and Pathe.
The top five films were almost unchanged from last weekend.
Rian Johnson’s acclaimed, star-studded whodunit “Knives Out” remained in second place with $14.2 million, declining a modest 47% in its second week of release. With $63.5 million cumulatively and $124.1 million worldwide, the Lionsgate release has been one of the season’s bright spots.
So has James Mangold’s “Ford v Ferrari,” which stayed in third place with $6.5 million over its fourth weekend. The racing drama, starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, has sped to a global take of $168 million for Disney, which acquired the film’s original studio, 20th Century Fox, earlier this year. The film cost about $100 million to make.
Melina Matsoukas’ outlaw romance “Queen & Slim” moved up to fourth in its second week with $6.5 million, swapping places with Marielle Heller’s Mister Rogers drama “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” ($5.2 million in its third weekend).
Todd Haynes’ true-story legal drama “Dark Waters,” starring Mark Ruffalo as a defense attorney who takes on the DuPont chemical company, expanded nationwide to 2,011 theatres. The Focus Features release made $4.1 million.
Celine Sciamma’s acclaimed period romance “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” opened at two locations with a very strong $33,552 per-theatre average. Neon will release the French film wider in February.
Some of the weekend’s most widespread movie watching may have been on Netflix, though the streaming service doesn’t disclose viewership tallies or box-office receipts.
After a three-week theatrical run, Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story,” one of the year’s most critically acclaimed films, began streaming Friday. On Friday, Nielsen said Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” last weekend drew an average audience of 13.6 million viewers from Nov. 27 to Dec. 1. Netflix has said Nielsen numbers, which only estimate US viewership, reflect an incomplete picture.
Amazon likewise didn’t release ticket sales for “The Aeronauts,” which opened in 52 theatres over the weekend. Tom Harper’s film, which cost $40 million to make, stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as 19th century balloonists.
A week before it opens in North America, Sony’s “Jumanji: The Next Level” debuted in 18 international countries where it made $52.5 million. The sequel to 2017’s “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” which grossed $962 million worldwide, is expected to lead the box office next weekend.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at US and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

“Frozen 2,” $34.7 million ($90.2 million international).
“Knives Out,” $14.2 million ($18 million international).
“Ford v Ferrari,” $6.5 million ($8.3 million international).
“Queen & Slim,” $6.5 million.
“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” $5.2 million.
“Dark Waters,” $4.1 million.
“21 Bridges,” $2.9 million.
“Playing With Fire,” $2 million.
“Midway,” $1.9 million.
“Joker,” $1 million.

77,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/marriage-story-dominates-gotham-awards-with-4-wins/,"NEW YORK: Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” was the resounding winner at the IFP Gotham Awards, taking four awards including best feature at the annual New York awards-season kickoff.
By the end of the night on Monday, Baumbach, having long ago exhausted his one prepared speech, stood at the podium exhorting cast members Adam Driver and Laura Dern to lend him help. Having already given their own speeches — Driver for best actor, Dern as a tribute honoree — they demurred, content to watch Baumbach squirm again while he improvised a few remarks.

Baumbach turned, ultimately, to his actors — “My special effect, my everything is the cast,” he said — and to Netflix for what he called its “unconditional” support of his film, a portrait of divorce starring Driver and Scarlett Johansson. Earlier, Baumbach thanked Netflix, too, for saving the Manhattan single-screen Paris Theatre, which the streaming company purchased last week.
Praise for Netflix and its chief content creative officer Ted Sarandos, who was also in attendance, was a common refrain throughout the evening. The streaming service, which filled up numerous tables at the banquet at Cipriani’s Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, also celebrated wins for Ava DuVernay’s Central Park Five series “When They See Us,” (DuVernay was additionally singled out for tribute) and the documentary “American Factory.”
The Gothams, now in their 29th year, is the premier New York gala for independent film, a kind of earlier East Coast corollary to Los Angeles’ Independent Film Spirit Awards in February. Put on by the nonprofit Independent Film Project with nominees selected by committees, Gotham winners can diverge from seasonal favourites. Last year, Chloe Zhao’s lyrical Western “The Rider” took the best feature.
But a recent stretch of Gotham winners went on to land best picture at the Academy Awards, including Barry Jenkins’ “Moonlight,” Tom McCarthy’s “Spotlight” and Alejandro Inarritu’s “Birdman.”
And “Marriage Story,” which begins streaming Friday after playing for several weeks in theaters, seems sure to continue a long march through awards season. Acclaim has been heaped on its leads and its ensemble, and it’s been celebrated as a crowning achievement for the 50-year-old Baumbach.
While not a surprise to others, the most shocked winner of the evening was easily Awkwafina, who took the best actress for her performance in Lulu Wang’s family drama “The Farewell.”
“Oh my god. I never won anything. I can’t even win an argument in the Instagram comments,” said Awkwafina.
A handful of movies up for best feature — “Uncut Gems” with Adam Sandler, “Hustlers” with Jennifer Lopez — went home emptyhanded. Trey Edward Schultz’ ambitious family melodrama “Waves,” also up for best feature, scored an award for Taylor Russell as a breakthrough actor.
The Gotham Awards liberally sprinkle in tributes throughout the ceremony. This year’s honorees included Dern, DuVernay, Sam Rockwell, FilmNation chief executive Glen Basner and Jason DaSilva, a filmmaker and disability rights activist. DaSilva’s Emmy-winning documentary “When I Walk” chronicles his own experience with multiple sclerosis.
DuVernay shared her tips for directing, among them: treat actors and crew the same, don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know” and change your socks at lunchtime.
Both Baumbach and Greta Gerwig presented Dern with her award, donning what they called “Laura Dern sweaters” for the occasion. The two filmmakers, aside from living together as a couple with a son, share Dern in their latest movies. In “Marriage Story,” Dern plays a ruthless divorce attorney. In Gerwig’s “Little Women” (an upcoming Sony Pictures release ineligible for the Gothams), she plays Louisa May Alcott’s benevolent matriarch Marmee.
Gerwig and Baumbach swapped their speeches, which resulted in Baumbach declaring that he loved Dern “even more than Leonardo DiCaprio, who I sincerely believed I would someday marry.”
The Gothams reliably serve as pep rallies for independent cinema and those that toil in the ever-threatened lower-budgeted realm of moviemaking. Presenter Natasha Lyonne, whose Netflix series “Russian Doll” was nominated for best breakthrough series in episodes less than 40 minutes, evoked that sense of indie pride with more than a touch of sarcasm.
“If there’s one thing everyone in the room can agree on,” Lyonne said while presenting, “it’s that we can never have enough Batman movies.”

78,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/the-who-plans-1st-cincinnati-area-concert-since-79-tragedy/,"CINCINNATI: The rock band The Who announced Tuesday night it will play its first Cincinnati area concert since 11 fans died 40 years ago in a pre-show stampede.
The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame band will play April 23 at Northern Kentucky University’s BB&T Arena, across the Ohio River 7 miles south of the Dec 3, 1979, concert site, where another two dozen people were injured Dec. 3, 1979, amid confusion and lack of preparation for thousands of fans lined up for hours for first-come seats.

The announcement came after WCPO-TV in Cincinnati aired a Tuesday night documentary featuring interviews with lead singer Roger Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend, the remaining original members of the British band that emerged in the 1960s featuring songs of youthful rebellion such as “My Generation” and its “Summertime Blues” cover.
Both have said they’ve been haunted by the tragedy. Townshend recently told The Associated Press he was looking forward to discussing it in Cincinnati.
“Now we can have a conversation about it when we go back,” Townshend said.
“We will meet people and we’ll be there. We’ll be there. That’s what’s important,” he said. “I’m so glad that we’ve got this opportunity to go back.”
The band is adding the concert to its “Moving On!” tour 2020 dates.
The Who said it will donate a portion of proceeds from the Cincinnati area concert to a memorial scholarship fund benefiting students in the Cincinnati suburb of Finneytown. Daltrey visited a Finneytown High School memorial site in 2018 and the band has for years supported the scholarship effort there. Three of the 11 killed, including two 15-year-old girls who were the youngest victims, had attended Finneytown High.
The band didn’t know about the tragedy until the concert was ending. Longtime manager Bill Curbishley had made the decision to have the show go on, warning Cincinnati authorities that they wouldn’t be able to control the crowd if the concert was called off.
“Despite everything, I still feel inadequate,” he told WCPO. “I don’t know about the guys, but for me, I left a little bit of my soul in Cincinnati.”

Hit animated movie takes inspiration from Sámi culture
Sámi people live in northern Europe
“Frozen 2” dubbed in North Sámi, rare move for a blockbuster

OSLO: The sequel to Walt Disney Co’s 2013 hit animated musical “Frozen” is generating excitement among indigenous Sámi people in northern Europe, whose culture the movie has taken inspiration from.
“Frozen 2” debuted in US cinemas on Nov 22 and is progressively rolling out worldwide. On its debut weekend, it grossed $350 million, making it “the biggest opening ever for Walt Disney Animation (not including Pixar)”, according to Hollywood trade publication Variety. The movie opens in Norway on Christmas Day.

Norway inspired many elements of the first “Frozen” movie, such as character Anna’s dress or the architecture of the fictional kingdom of Arendelle.
The second film takes inspiration from the culture of the Sámi, an indigenous minority living across Norway, Sweden, Finland and northern Russia, who have faced discrimination against their language and culture.
In Norway, a state-appointed truth and reconciliation commission is investigating the discrimination perpetrated on minorities including the Sámi and Kven peoples.
“I am planning to see the movie again with my whole family,” said Aili Keskitalo, president of the consultative Sámi Parliament in Norway, who attended the film’s world premiere in Los Angeles with her 11-year-old daughter and set a scene from the movie as her Facebook profile picture.
“Frozen 2” sees Anna and sister Elsa head north of Arendelle to find out the truth about a mystery. They meet the Northuldra, who live closely with the reindeer. Reindeer herding is a traditional Sámi activity.
“Some of the beautiful costumes in the film took inspiration from our gákti. They also took inspiration from the guksi, our traditional wooden cup,” said Anne Lajla Utsi, a member of a Sámi advisory group that collaborated with the filmmakers.
“We felt they really listened and that it was very important to them to do this right,” Utsi, managing director of the International Sámi Film Institute, told Reuters.
Disney signed a contract with Sámi representatives to commit themselves to portray their culture respectfully. That included supporting the dubbing of the movie in North Sámi, the most spoken of the Sámi languages, and release it at the same time as the Norwegian version.
When Utsi posted a picture of the “Frozen 2” poster on Facebook with its Sámi title, “Jikŋon 2”, it went viral.
“My youngest daughter is really looking forward to watching the movie again in her language,” said Keskitalo.
“My elder daughters, who are 22 and 25 years old, are also very excited about seeing the movie. It is not often that we see a movie in North Sámi. I think a lot of adults will see the movie too.” (

80,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/k-pop-singer-sentenced-to-6-years-in-jail-for-rape-sharing-secret-sex-videos/,"SEOUL: A South Korean court sentenced a K-pop musician to six years in prison on Friday for raping a woman and distributing a video capturing the act in a case that drew attention to the darker side of the country’s lucrative entertainment industry.
Jung Joon-young, 30, was arrested in March. Choi Jong-hoon, 30, a former member of South Korean boy band FT Island, was also sentenced to five years in prison for the rape of the woman.
Both were members of online chat groups that shared secret sex tapes and made jokes about drugging and raping women, the Seoul Central District Court said.
Jung’s conviction also includes the illegal distribution of other videos he took secretly while having sex with women. The identities of the victims were suppressed to protect their privacy.
The court also sentenced each man to 80 hours in “sexual violence treatment” education.
“The defendants are well-known celebrities and friends, but the chat they’ve had showed that they simply considered women as objects of sexual pleasure, and committed crimes that were extremely serious,” Judge Kang Seong-soo said as he handed down the verdict.
“Strict punishment is inevitable as the damage inflicted has not properly been recovered and the victims demand harsh penalties.”
Jung admitted distributing the video and others he took, though he argued the sex was in all cases consensual. Choi denied raping the woman, and had argued that he did not remember having sex with her and that if he had, it was likely consensual.
Lawyers for Jung and Choi could not be reached for comment.
Their case was one of several scandals involving sex crimes and other illegal activity that revealed a dark side of an industry at the centre of the global K-pop craze.
Lee Seung-hyun, a former member of K-pop group Big Bang better known by the stage name Seungri, is also on trial over accusations he paid for prostitutes for foreign businessmen to drum up investment in his business.

HONG KONG: Taiwanese-Canadian model-actor Godfrey Gao has died after suffering an apparent heart attack while on set in China.
Gao was filming a sports reality show in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo on Wednesday when he died. His agency, JetStar Entertainment, confirmed his death on its official Facebook page.
The 35-year-old was filming “Chase Me,” a Chinese variety series, when he reportedly fell while running. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to his agency.
The Taiwan-born Gao initially rose to fame by becoming the first Asian male model for the luxury brand Louis Vuitton. He acted in numerous television dramas and movies, including a role in the Hollywood film “The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.”
His body will be transported Wednesday to Taipei, Taiwan’s capital.

82,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/singer-goo-haras-death-shines-light-on-dark-side-of-k-pop/,"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA: The death of South Korean singer and actress Goo Hara, whose body was found at her home in Seoul this week, has again shone a spotlight on pressures that stars, especially females, face in the cutthroat K-pop industry and in deeply conservative South Korean society.
Goo’s death at age 28 came less than two months after the death of Choi Jin-ri, or Sulli, another K-pop star and Goo’s close friend. Experts say both Goo and Choi faced extensive cyberbullying and sexual harassment from the public and media throughout their careers, which took a toll on their mental health.

Police say they are still investigating Goo’s death and found a “pessimistic note” at her home.
Once popular mostly in Asia, K-pop has spread far beyond South Korea, thanks to wildly popular groups such as “BTS” and “Blackpink.”
Goo debuted in 2008 as part of the five-member girl group Kara, which shot almost immediately to fame and helped pioneer the K-pop global phenomenon.
She later launched a successful solo career in South Korea and Japan.
Sulli began her career around the same time as Goo, debuting as a member of the girl band f(x) in 2009. She also had multiple acting roles after stepping away from her singing career.
Goo made headlines when she took her former boyfriend, Choi Jong-bum, to court last year. Choi claimed to have been assaulted by her, while Goo accused him of threatening to release a sex video of her.
During the dispute, Goo’s Korean agency didn’t renew her contract. A court sentenced Choi to 1 ½ years in prison on charges of coercion and assaulting and blackmailing Goo. The jail term was suspended, keeping him out of prison. Choi appealed and the trial is still ongoing.
K-pop is highly competitive, with dozens of groups debuting each year. Industry experts have long warned about the dark side of the scandal-ridden industry. Aspiring artists, as young as their early teens, train for years. Only a few debuts and even fewer are commercially successful. The likelihood of their success increases if they sign with a handful of top entertainment agencies.
The industry is known to have strict rules for their stars — including dating bans, spartan training and diets, and sometimes slave-like and unfair contracts. Experts say the industry has additional requirements for its female artists, unspoken rules reflective of South Korea’s patriarchal society.
Park Hee-A, a K-pop journalist and writer of “Interviews with K-pop Stars,” said female stars are bound by rigid societal rules of femininity.
“Some female idol members have gotten ostracized for not smiling in a television show and reading a book about feminism that contradicts male-dominated patriarchal South Korean society,” Park told The Associated Press.
Expectations of purity and chastity govern women in South Korea. Goo faced a barrage of hate comments following media reports about the sex video despite her being the victim of revenge porn.
“The topic of sex is taboo in South Korea compared to western countries,” said Tae-Sung Yeum, attending psychiatrist at Gwanghwamun Forest Psychiatric Clinic. “There’s a high moral standard required, especially for female celebrities, because South Korea is a patriarchal society.”
Sulli, Goo’s long-time friend, also made headlines, often malicious and misogynistic, for speaking out about subjects such as ageism and feminism. She was criticized for wearing shirts without a bra, calling older male colleagues by their first names and openly supporting feminism.
Yeum said it’s difficult for K-pop stars to seek professional help for depression, especially in a country where many people believe that psychiatric disorders can be “treated with one’s will.” He said multiple suicides in the industry stem from stars being plunged into a hypercompetitive system with a plethora of abuses from a young age.
When Sulli was found dead in her Seongnam home, Goo bid farewell to her friend in a live-streamed video. “I will live more diligently for you,” Goo cried while apologizing for not being able to make it to her funeral.
Two days before Goo’s death, she uploaded a final selfie on her Instagram with the caption, “Good night.”

At the end of a year that saw musicians like Niall Horan and Ed Sheeran gingerly dip their toes into other languages, Coldplay have responded: Hold my European beer.
Their new album, “Everyday Life,” is so utterly embracing of the world that has words spoken or sung in Arabic, Spanish, Zulu and Igbo, and even a French verse sung by lead singer Chris Martin.
This cover image released by Parlophone/Atlantic shows “Everyday Life,” a release by Coldplay. Photo: Parlophone/Atlantic via AP
It’s a fluid and experimental 53-minute double album, divided into two halves, Sunrise and Sunset. If on 2015’s “A Head Full of Dreams,” the band sampled the likes of Barack Obama and a Rumi poem, now they’re doubling down.
“Everyday Life” is bursting with idiosyncratic references, ranging from the film “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” to a Bob Dylan lyric, a novel by Khaled Hosseini, audio of a bullying traffic stop by a cop in Philadelphia, an elegy to Africa, samples from Nigerian composer Harcourt Whyte and jazz legend Alice Coltrane, the South African activist song “Jikelele” and an exuberant tune about Syrian refugees (“Orphans,” which features a credit for Martin’s teenage son, Moses).
“Orphans” is really the only traditional-sounding Coldplay song. The others are often subdued, instrumental or undercooked. “I haven’t finished this one yet” say the liner notes on the stripped-down and fragmentary “WOTW/POTP.” It’s an astonishing, unsafe step from a band who could have just kept giving us “Something Like This.”
There are ambient sounds and snippets from films, including the documentaries “Everything Is Incredible” and “Fela Kuti: Music is the Weapon.” The band even seems to reference themselves (“Boom bo-boom boom” from “X Marks the Spot.”) Sometimes it feels less than an album and more like a multimedia project.
Fans will find that, sonically, the band has stepped off the dance floor. The new music is less bombastic and more intimate. “Old Friends” is a mournful ode to loss, while “Daddy” is sung from the heartbreaking perspective of an abandoned child. “Daddy are you OK?/Look dad we got the same hair.” There’s even spots of gospel and funk-jazz.
The band is also playing with time, with lyrics and credits seemingly created on an old typewriter and offering old timey band portraits that recall those famous shots of The Band.
There are also political songs — the menacing “Trouble in Town” and the sarcastic “Guns” — but most of the album is about faith — all faiths, from East Asian Buddhism to Pakistani Sufism.
It begins with a prayer in “Church” — “Oh, Father, God Almighty, why have you forsaken me?” — and ends 15 songs later with a soft thanksgiving Hallelujah, thanks to the gentle title track’s earnest plea for peace (sounding not unlike something from “Parachutes”)
“How in the world am I going to see/You as my brother not my enemy,” Martin sings. “Got to keep dancing when the lights go out.” In response to an ailing world, Coldplay are opening their arms wide and refusing to stop believing.

85,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/leonard-cohens-posthumous-album-centres-on-poetry/,"Leonard Cohen, “Thanks for the Dance” (Columbia/Legacy Recordings)
Leonard Cohen’s last album, released just weeks before he passed in 2016, was “You Want It Darker,” which had a sense of finality that made it a fine conclusion to his brilliant musical career.
“Thanks for the Dance,” on the other hand, seems to bring down the curtain on Cohen’s parallel universe, the poetry he started to publish long before he began making records.
Illustrating the point, the new nine-track set is more like a Cohen spoken-word performance with very good and empathetic musical backing, most of it composed by his son, Adam.
Understated exceptions are the title track and a few lines here and there, but Cohen doesn’t really sing, not that his resonant voice needs a melody to convey the experience, depth, humour, horror and beauty of his lyrics.
Expanding on recordings made mostly at the same time as the sessions for “You Want It Darker,” Adam Cohen and engineer/mixer Michael Chaves searched out some of the master’s previous collaborators and some new ones to complete the compositions. Among them are Sharon Robinson, Jennifer Warnes, the Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue Choir, Beck, Daniel Lanois, Feist, Javier Mas, Zac Rae, Patrick Leonard and Anjani Thomas.
“Happens to the Heart” opens the album with haunting guitar, laud and piano supporting Cohen’s listing of a life’s worth of experiences, the gentle accompaniment from Andre de Ridder’s stargaze orchestra making the lines even more effective — “I was always working steady/But I never called it art.”
The title track could be a sequel to “Take This Waltz,” a 1980s song with lyrics Cohen adapted from a poem by Federico García Lorca. Here the themes appear to be more personal but just as inspired.
Other highlights include the subtle flamenco airs of “The Night of Santiago,” the dark-as-night and terrifying “Puppets” and closer “Listen to the Hummingbird,” a short but wise and emotional epilogue.
“Thanks for the Dance” is like discovering a box of old letters — or in this case, poems — from a departed loved one. It’s an emotional experience that allows Cohen’s great talents to be appreciated again.

“Joker,” a dark origin story from Warner Bros about Batman’s arch nemesis, had sold $999.1 billion as of Thursday despite not having been screened in China, which is projected to become the world’s largest movie market next year.
Starring Joaquin Phoenix as a mentally-ill loner who finds fame through a random act of violence, the movie earned warm reviews as it opened in early October but stoked controversy in the United States over fears it would encourage violence.



Box office analyst Gitesh Pandya said “Joker” would top the $1 billion level on Friday.


“Absolutely jaw-dropping achievement for an R-rated film with a moderate budget and no China release,” Pandya, founder and editor of Box Office Guru, wrote on Twitter.
Its nearest R-rated rivals are 2018 movie “Deadpool 2” ($785 million) and 2016’s “Deadpool” ($783 million), both starring Ryan Reynolds as a foul-mouthed superhero.



Thanks to a modest production budget estimated at about $60 million, “Joker” is also the most profitable comic book movie ever, according to Forbes.com, due largely to the film’s focus on character rather than special effects and action scenes.



“Joker” is now the 7th biggest Hollywood movie at the 2019 box office, behind action-packed blockbuster “Avengers: Endgame” at $2.8 billion and family movie “The Lion King” at $1.6 billion, both from Walt Disney.
The movie is expected to land nominations in the upcoming Hollywood awards season and has inspired fans to visit the spot in New York’s Bronx district where Phoenix’s character transforms into the Joker, his face painted like a clown and with green hair, and dances triumphantly down a set of steep steps.

91,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/disney-plus-adds-disclaimer-about-racist-movie-stereotypes/,"NEW YORK: Disney’s new streaming service has added a disclaimer to “Dumbo,” “Peter Pan” and other classics because they depict racist stereotypes, underscoring a challenge media companies face when they resurrect older movies in modern times.
The move comes as Disney Plus seems to be an instant hit. It attracted 10 million subscribers in just one day. The disclaimer reads, “This program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.”
Companies have been grappling for years with how to address stereotypes that were in TV shows and movies decades ago but look jarring today. Streaming brings the problem to the fore.
In “Dumbo,” from 1941, crows that help Dumbo learn to fly are depicted with exaggerated black stereotypical voices. The lead crow’s name is “Jim Crow,” a term that describes a set of laws that legalized segregation. In “Peter Pan,” from 1953, Native American characters are caricatured. Other Disney movies with the disclaimer include “The Jungle Book” and “Swiss Family Robinson.”
“Pocahontas” and “Aladdin” do not have it, despite rumblings by some that those films contain stereotypes, too.
On personal computers, the disclaimer appears as part of the text description of shows and movies underneath the video player. It’s less prominent on a cellphone’s smaller screen. Viewers are instructed to tap on a “details” tab for an “advisory.”
Disney’s disclaimer echoes what other media companies have done in response to problematic videos, but many people are calling on Disney to do more.
The company “needs to follow through in making a more robust statement that this was wrong, and these depictions were wrong,” said Psyche Williams-Forson, chairwoman of American studies at the University of Maryland at College Park. “Yes, we’re at a different time, but we’re also not at a different time.”
She said it is important that the images are shown rather than deleted, because viewers should be encouraged to talk with their children and others about the videos and their part in our cultural history.
Disney’s disclaimer is a good way to begin discussion about the larger issue of racism that is embedded in our cultural history, said Gayle Wald, American studies chairwoman at George Washington University.
“Our cultural patrimony in the end is deeply tethered to our histories of racism, our histories of colonialism and our histories of sexism, so in that sense it helps to open up questions,” she said.
Wald said Disney is “the most culturally iconic and well-known purveyor of this sort of narrative and imagery,” but it’s by no means alone.
Universal Pictures’ teen comedy “Sixteen Candles” has long been decried for stereotyping Asians with its “Long Duk Dong” character.
Warner Bros. faced a similar problem with its “Tom and Jerry” cartoons that are available for streaming. Some of the cartoons now carry a disclaimer as well, but it goes further than Disney’s statement.
Rather than refer to vague “cultural depictions,” the Warner Bros. statement calls its own cartoons out for “ethnic and racial prejudices.”
“While these cartoons do not represent today’s society, they are being presented as they were originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed,” the statement reads.
At times, Disney has disavowed a movie entirely.
“Song of the South,” from 1946, which won an Oscar for the song “Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,” was never released for home video and hasn’t been shown theatrically for decades, due to its racist representation of the plantation worker Uncle Remus and other characters. It isn’t included in Disney Plus, either.
Disney and Warner Bros did not respond to requests for comment.
Sonny Skyhawk, an actor and producer who created the group American Indians in Film and Television, found the two-sentence disclaimer lacking.
What would serve minority groups better than any disclaimer is simply offering them opportunities to tell their own stories on a platform like Disney Plus, Skyhawk said. He said that when he talks to young Indian kids, “the biggest negative is they don’t see themselves represented in America.”

Helena Bonham Carter, who takes on Elizabeth’s younger sister Princess Margaret, said she was a joy to play.



“The hardest thing about playing Margaret or anybody of the family is that ultimately so many people feel they know her. And everyone has an opinion,” Bonham Carter told Reuters Television on the red carpet.
“There were so many really close friends that were all too happy to talk about her and wanted to and really loved her and also wanted to show the side that was less known about her – that she was funny, that she was full of warmth and that she was very multicolored,” the actress said.
Erin Doherty, who plays second-born child Princess Anne, said that working on the series had made her more sympathetic to the royal family.


“After doing this show, I feel like I understand them a lot more and I really, really value them and I have a lot of empathy for them,” Doherty said.


Asked whether he thought the royal family watched the show, Tobias Menzies, who plays the queen’s husband Prince Philip in middle age, said he doubted it.
“It makes me a bit nervous imagining them watching it. I’d be amazed if they watch it, but maybe they do…. My money is that they probably don’t,” he said.

93,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/people-magazine-names-john-legend-as-2019-sexiest-man-alive/,"LOS ANGELES: R&B crooner John Legend has been named the Sexiest Man Alive by People magazine.
The Grammy-winning singer known for his silky-smooth vocals was revealed as this year’s winner Tuesday night on NBC’s “The Voice.” He serves as a coach on the singing competition series with Gwen Stefani, Kelly Clarkson and Blake Shelton.
Shelton, who was named Sexiest Man Alive in 2017, announced Legend’s honor on “The Voice.” The country singer then handed Legend some short shorts with bedazzled letters “EGOTSMA” to signify the singer’s many honors: an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony and now, Sexiest Man Alive.
Legend tells the magazine in an issue out Friday the honor comes with some pressure after following Idris Elba, who was last year’s winner. He jokes it “is not fair and is not nice to me!”
The 40-year-old Legend is a 10-time Grammy winner. He scored an Oscar in 2015 for co-writing the song “Glory” from the film “Selma.” He won a Tony Award for his co-producer work on “Jitney” and took home an Emmy as a producer on NBC’s live version of “Jesus Christ Superstar,” a project in which he also played the role of Jesus.
Legend has two children with model-television host-cookbook author Chrissy Teigen.
Other recent winners include Dwayne Johnson, Chris Hemsworth, Adam Levine, Channing Tatum and David Beckham.
“I want to thank Blake Shelton,” Legend said. “I observed every move he made, every utterance that came from his mouth and I think some of it rubbed off on me.”
Legend said his wife is proud of him.
“I’ve finally impressed her,” he said.
The couple’s children? Not so much. Teigen posted a video of the reveal of their daughter asking to turn off “The Voice” and go

94,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/war-epic-midway-bests-doctor-sleep-at-the-box-office/,"LOS ANGELES: Despite a fresh injection of four big movies into the marketplace including a Stephen King adaptation, a World War II epic, a glossy, holiday-themed romantic comedy and a family-friendly comedy, audiences largely stayed away from theatres this weekend and the North American box office is hurting.
Down nearly 27% from last year, the sluggish weekend allowed for a few big surprises, however. The biggest surprise was the fact that the Roland Emmerich film “Midway,” which slightly overperformed, snagged the first-place spot over Warner Bros.’ “Doctor Sleep,” a film that came in well under expectations and has left many in the business scratching their heads as to why.

Lionsgate on Sunday estimated that “Midway” earned $17.5 million from 3,242 screens. The studio acquired the film about the Battle of Midway that features a large ensemble cast including Nick Jonas and Patrick Wilson.
“As expected, everyone is ecstatic,” said David Spitz, Lionsgate’s president of domestic distribution.
“Midway” cost a reported $100 million to produce and the studio is projecting that the film will have grossed $20.1 million by the end of Veteran’s Day Monday.
Reviews didn’t seem to play into account with the box office at all this weekend. Critics were not kind to “Midway” (it’s currently at 40% on Rotten Tomatoes), but audiences, who were largely male (60 and older (87% were over 25) had given the film an A CinemaScore.
And although $17.5 million is not a massive number on its own, it was a significant upset since going into the weekend experts thought the No. 1 spot would easily go to Warner Bros.’ “Doctor Sleep,” the high-profile Stephen King adaptation starring Ewan McGregor. But audiences slept on the well-reviewed (73% on Rotten Tomatoes) sequel to King’s “The Shining” and it grossed only $14.1 million from over 3,800 locations. The film from director Mike Flanagan even utilized the classic imagery of Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film version of “The Shining,” which factored heavily into the marketing.
Budgeted at around $50 million, “Doctor Sleep” was expected to open to over $25 million. The studio was disappointed with the result. But it’s at least partially attributable to the “general malaise” at the box office this weekend.
“There’s no way to sugarcoat this, this was a pretty awful weekend for the overall marketplace,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for the box office tracker Comscore.
In a more minor surprise, Paramount Pictures’ John Cena-led “Playing With Fire,” a family-friendly comedy about firefighters, opened in third place with $12.8 million over Universal Pictures’ Wham!-inspired romantic comedy “Last Christmas.” Starring Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, “Last Christmas” took fourth place with $11.6 million. But Universal is optimistic about its prospects, considering the thematic nature of the film and the holiday weekends to come.
“We have a fantastic storyteller in Paul Feig and a ridiculously charming cast,” said Universal’s distribution head Jim Orr.
Once again, the bright spots at the box office are in the awards-friendly limited releases. Amazon opened Shia LaBeouf’s autobiographical film “Honey Boy” in four locations, where it earned a strong $288,824. And Lauren Greenfield’s Imelda Marcos documentary “The Kingmaker” opened in two locations to $23,600. Both “Parasite,” which earned $2.6 million from 603 locations, and “Jojo Rabbit,” which added $3.9 million from 802 locations, also continue to perform well as the films expand a little bit each week.
But it’s still one of the worst early November weekends in years and Dergarabedian noted that the smaller films are not going to move the needle on the overall box office for the year, which remains down 5.5%.
“It’s definitely a little bit of a challenged box office,” Orr said.
Although The Walt Disney Co.’s “Frozen 2” is on the horizon to help pick things up, Dergarabedian said that at this point, 2019 might not best the record 2018 box office year.
“I think it’d be really tough at this point (to surpass 2018). But it’s not a ‘Chicken Little’ situation,” Dergarabedian said. “When we compare to any other year it’s a solid year.”
Still, he added, “For November, this is a very slow weekend.”

95,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/woody-allen-amazon-end-legal-dispute-over-movie-deal/,"
NEW YORK: Woody Allen has ended his $68 million lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc for backing out of a four-picture production and distribution agreement and refusing to distribute a film he had finished.
Allen and Amazon notified the federal court in Manhattan late on Friday night that the lawsuit was being voluntarily dismissed.
Lawyers for Allen and Amazon did not immediately respond on Saturday to requests for comment.
Allen had sued two Amazon units in February, claiming they could not abandon their distribution plans, including for his completed “A Rainy Day in New York,” because of a “baseless” allegation that he had molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992.
Amazon countered in court papers that Allen’s comments related to the #MeToo movement, which began in late 2017, ensured that the company could never receive the expected benefits from its contract with Allen, justifying its decision to end their relationship.
The filmmaker has long denied the allegation by Dylan Farrow, which was also made by her mother Mia Farrow, who appeared in a dozen Allen films and was his longtime partner. He has not been charged.
Allen has won four Oscars, including best director for 1977’s “Annie Hall,” which also won the best picture.
But he has seen modest commercial returns for many films since breaking up with Mia Farrow, and some actors and actresses have expressed regret for appearing in his films after Dylan Farrow’s allegation gained renewed attention.
“Rainy Day” has been released outside the United States but not domestically.

96,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/netflix-serves-up-green-eggs-and-ham-with-all-star-cast/,"LOS ANGELES: When screenwriter Jared Stern was approached about developing Dr Seuss’ “Green Eggs and Ham” as an animated series, he sought advice from one important woman and the consent of another.
“I mentioned it to my grandmother and she said, ‘That was your favourite book when you were little. You used to read it to me all the time,'” Stern fondly recalled. “I basically learned to read reading this book.”
This image released by Netflix shows Snerz, voiced by Eddie Izzard, in a scene from the animated series “Green Eggs and Ham,” premiering Nov 8. Photo: Netflix via AP
But he needed more than grandmom behind him. The project required approval from the widow of Theodor Geisel, the singular writer known as Dr Seuss. So Stern and fellow executive producer Jeff Kleeman made a pilgrimage to her San Diego-area home about five years ago. Audrey Geisel died last year; her husband died in 1991.
“I had to pitch the story to her and it was incredibly scary,” said Stern. “Once it was over, she said something to the effect of, ‘I wondered what you were going to do with this. But I think you really captured it, and you have our blessing.'”
The result is a 13-episode series debuting Friday on Netflix with a voice cast that includes Michael Douglas as the character who turns up his nose at green eggs and ham and Adam Devine as Sam-I-am, the dish’s cheerleader. Other big-name actors along for the ride include Diane Keaton, Eddie Izzard, Tracy Morgan, John Turturro and Jeffrey Wright. (“Having Ellen DeGeneres as an executive producer certainly helps,” Stern said.)
Stern understood Audrey Geisel’s initial doubts since he shared them when the project was proposed by Kleeman, president of DeGeneres’ production company. Stern’s first reaction: Why mess with perfection? Then he gave the 1960 book another look.
“I started flipping through it and realized, ‘Oh, it’s an odd couple.’ There’s the grumpy guy who’s closed off to things and a playful guy who’s open to things. And not only that, it’s a road trip because he won’t eat the eggs in a car, on a train, on a boat — here, there and everywhere,” he said, allowing the original story to be opened up while staying true to its message and spirit.
Devine, of the “Pitch Perfect” movies and TV’s “The Righteous Gemstones” and “Modern Family,” said he focused on bringing “manic little kid enthusiasm” to Sam-I-Am.
“I’m basically doing an impression of myself opening Christmas presents…. just how excited you would get when you’re a kid, and you want to explain all your toys and explain how you’re going to play with them,” Devine said.
The series lets him play with his lines. “The dialogue is just so fun. When you actually get through a chunk where you’re doing a lot of Seussian-type dialogue, you feel so good about yourself.”
Stern, whose big-screen animation writing credits include “The Lego Batman Movie” and “Wreck-It Ralph,” has a close familiarity with the various styles of animation, including the now-common CGI. But the majority of the characters and backgrounds in “Green Eggs and Ham” are traditional 2-D hand-drawn animation, which evokes Seuss’ charming storybook illustrations and involved 300 artists over the course of four years of production.
That severely tested her patience, joked DeGeneres. But the result is something parents who remember the book warmly can watch with their kids, she said, and without having their own limits pushed.
“It’s great for kids and it’s great for parents to have on without being annoyed. It’s not going to be somebody singing, ‘Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo,'” she said reciting the omnipresent video ditty. “That could drive parents crazy.”

97,https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/goodness-and-humor-celebrated-as-sesame-street-turns-50/,"NEW YORK: Fifty years ago, beloved entertainer Carol Burnett appeared on the very first broadcast of a quirky TV program that featured a bunch of furry puppets.
Blink and you might miss it, but Burnett followed a cartoon about a witch called Wanda, which was loaded with words beginning with the letter w.
“Wow, Wanda the Witch is weird,” Burnett commented. And then — poof — she was gone.

That show was “Sesame Street” and Burnett, like a lot of kids, was instantly hooked. She would return to the show multiple times, including visits to demonstrate to pre-school viewers where her nose was and to smooch a rubber duckie.
“I was a big fan. I would have done anything they wanted me to do,” she said. “I loved being exposed to all that goodness and humor.”
This first episode of “Sesame Street” — sponsored by the letters W, S and E and the numbers 2 and 3 — aired in the fall of 1969. It was a turbulent time in America, rocked by the Vietnam War and raw from the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King the year before. The media, like today, was going through disruption.
Newt Minow, who was the Federal Communications Commission chairman at the time, famously said TV was becoming “a vast wasteland.” Like today, there was lots of content, but it wasn’t necessarily quality.


Enter “Sesame Street” creators Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett, who worked with Harvard University developmental psychologist Gerald Lesser to build the show’s unique approach to teaching that now reaches 120 million children. Legendary puppeteer Jim Henson supplied the critters.


“It wasn’t about if kids were learning from TV, it was about what they were learning from TV,” said Steve Youngwood, the chief operating officer of Sesame Workshop. “If they could harness that power to teach them the alphabet and their numbers as opposed to the words to beer commercials, you may be able to make a really big difference.”
No one else was doing it. Children’s programing at the time was made up of shows like “Captain Kangaroo,” ″Romper Room” and the violent skirmishes between “Tom & Jerry.” ″Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood” was lovely, but it was mostly teaching social skills.
“There was nothing even remotely that contained any educational component at all for children,” said Phillip Levine, a professor of economics at Wellesley College who has studied the show. ”‘Sesame Street’ was 100% about education.”
The show was designed by education professionals and child psychologists with one goal: to help low-income and minority students aged 2-5 overcome some of the deficiencies they had when entering school. Social scientists had long noted white and higher income kids were often better prepared.
So, it wasn’t an accident that the show was set on an urban street with a multicultural cast. Diversity and inclusion were baked into the show. Monsters, humans and animals all lived together peacefully.
Bert, Ernie and the gang made an instant impression on actress Sonia Manzano. She saw a neighborhood that looked like hers. She saw people who looked like her. She would become a cast member, Maria, on the show, starring and writing for it from 1971-2015, including getting married on air.
“I was raised without seeing people of color on television. So, when I was given the opportunity to be a person of color on television, I jumped at it,” said Manzano, who is of Latino descent. “And I think I was successful as Maria because I never forgot that there could be a little kid like me watching television and forming ideas about the world.”
Over the years, “Sesame Street” has welcomed many more. It became the first children’s program to feature someone with Down syndrome. It’s had puppets with HIV and in foster care, invited children in wheelchairs, dealt with topics like jailed parents, homelessness, women’s rights, military families and even girls singing about loving their hair.
It introduced the bilingual Rosita — the first Latina Muppet — in 1991. Julia, a 4-year-old Muppet with autism came in 2017 and this year has offered help for kids whose parents are dealing with addiction and recovery. So important is the show that PETA recently asked for the creation of a vegan Muppet.
“We are a mirror to society here even though we’re dealing with birds and chickens and monsters,” said Matt Vogel, the puppeteer who portrays Big Bird and the Count and who grew up watching “Sesame Street.”
When actor Will Lee, who played the grocer Mr. Hooper, died in 1982, the show explained death to children. When Big Bird lost his nest to a hurricane, the community rebuilt his home. To help kids after 9/11, Elmo was left traumatized by a fire at Hooper’s store but was soothingly told that firefighters were there to help.
“We see a need and we meet that need because I feel like we have a voice that’s loud enough that can do that — that can reach people and make a difference,” Vogel said. “Our mission is to make kids smarter, stronger and kinder and that those lessons that we impart to them stay with them.”
Therapist Jerry Moe, the national director of the Hazelden Betty Ford Children’s Program , applauds the show for helping children handle trauma — addiction, PTSD, death.
“While the numbers and the colors and the sizes and the shapes are all incredibly important, so is that social-emotional development that children need,” he said.
″‘Sesame Street’ deals with the reality of what’s going on with the kids today. And ‘Sesame Street’ does it in such a child-friendly, age-appropriate, developmentally-appropriate way that not only grabs kids’ attention, but also all the providers,” Moe said.
Celebrity appearances — starting with Burnett and now numbering 650 — aren’t just a fun component of the show, they’re part of the lesson. From Janelle Monae to Sarah Jessica Parker, from Anderson Cooper to Danny DeVito — they’re all part of an attempt to lure parents to watch as well.
“When parents watch the show with their kids, the learning is deeper because you have a conversation about what you watched together. You talk about it,” said Benjamin Lehmann, executive producer. “The parents are there to scaffold on the lessons.”
In the adults’ honor are characters who go over the heads of young viewers — Ethel Mermaid, Baa Baa Walters and Alistair Cookie — not to mention spoofs like “Orange Is the New Snack,” ″Grouch Eye for the Nice Guy” and “Upside Downton Abbey.”
Not everyone has adored the show, especially those who grouse about federal funds going to a nonprofit that earns millions on licensing for everything from lunch boxes and toys to diapers and commercials for Farmers Insurance.
Big Bird in 2012 found himself unexpectedly in the presidential race when Mitt Romney said he would defund public broadcasting if elected. “I love Big Bird,” then-President Barack Obama retorted. (On “Saturday Night Live,” Big Bird insisted he didn’t want to “ruffle any feathers.”)
In 2015, the longtime PBS show inked a five-year pact with HBO that gave the premium cable channel the right to air new episodes nine months before they air on PBS. That prompted some criticism that Sesame Workshop favored viewers who could afford HBO over those who could not. But since the HBO deal, the show has not gotten any federal funding.
Before each season, educators and creators gather to align the curriculum with the latest thinking. In the past, for example, narrative stories were broken up into little chunks because the thinking at the time was that kids couldn’t follow a long story. That turns out not to be true, and “Sesame Street” now delivers 10-minute narratives.
Sesame Workshop has also pared episodes from an hour to 30 minutes, and the show is now shot on 4K, with the creators knowing that most children are watching on tablets or phones.
Does it all really help? In 2016, Levine and economist Melissa Kearney at the University of Maryland produced one of the most widely cited studies about the impact of “Sesame Street.”
They compared households that got the show with those who didn’t and found that the children exposed to “Sesame Street” were 14% more likely to be enrolled in the correct grade level for their age at middle and high school.
“There’s no question that the introduction of ‘Sesame Street’ was a good thing,” Levine said. “Early childhood intervention does have the ability to improve lifelong learning among children.”
Some shows have lasted longer — “Meet the Press” and “The Tonight Show” among them — but few have had as big a cultural impact. “Sesame Street” is shown in more than 150 countries, has won 193 Emmys, 10 Grammys and will get a 2019 Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement in December, the first time a television program will receive the award.
Music has always been a big part of the show and its song “Rubber Duckie” peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard charts in 1970. “Sing,” which premiered on the show, went even higher, hitting No. 3 on Billboard in 1973 when the Carpenters recorded it.
There have been a few bumps in the road, like Roosevelt Franklin, an early puppet whose stereotypical African American dialect offended many. Katy Perry showed a little too much Katy Perry for some parents in 2010 and Cookie Monster, in the face of an obesity epidemic, had to moderate his adoration of cookies to “a sometimes food.”
But the show is still going strong despite an explosion of cheap online alternatives with bright colors and songs — like “Baby Shark” — all competing for preschoolers’ eyeballs. One recent study found kids as young as 2 had a daily screen time diet of 3 hours.
“There’s a different version of a wasteland right now. And in some ways that motivates us even more to make sure that we, and the industry at large, doesn’t give into that,” Youngwood said. “We have to earn their time every day as opposed to the view that it’s an entitlement.”

NEW YORK: Stocks ended slightly higher on Friday, helped by better-than-expected quarterly results from Google’s parent Alphabet and retailer Amazon and a modest recovery in oil prices.
However, the gains were held back by disappointing results from Exxon Mobil as well as news out of the Bank of Japan, which did not announce as much stimulus as many had hoped.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 24.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,432.24.
The Dow was held back partly by a drop in the oil giant Exxon Mobil. The company reported its smallest quarterly profit in 17 years, well below what analysts were looking for, due to the continuing weakness in oil prices. Its major competitor, Chevron, fared slightly better. While earnings dropped sharply from a year ago, Chevron’s results still beat analysts’ expectations.
Exxon fell $1.25, or 1.4 percent, to $88.95. Chevron climbed 69 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $102.48 after being down earlier in the day.
Broader market indicators ended higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,173.60 and the Nasdaq composite increased 7.15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,162.13.
Wall Street is finishing out its busiest week of corporate earnings, which was dominated by mostly strong results from technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and others.
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped $25.50, or 3.3 percent, to $791.34. The company reported earnings of $8.42 a share, well above the $8.04 that analysts were looking for.
Amazon rose $6.20, or 1 percent, to $758.81. The online retail giant reported a profit of $1.78 per share, well above the $1.11 a share that analysts expected. Amazon reported it sold $30.4 billion in goods in the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier.
The strong results from Amazon and Google, as well as the results from other tech companies, helped lift the technology-heavy Nasdaq 1.2 percent this week, while the Dow lost 0.8 percent. The S&P 500 closed the week down slightly. It was the first weekly loss for the S&P 500 after four weeks of gains.
So far, corporate profits appear to be coming well ahead of what were very low expectations. Earnings in the S&P 500 so far are down 2.4 percent from a year ago, which is better than the 5.2 percent decline expected when earnings season started, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“Expectations were exceptionally low for the second quarter. While consumers goods and technology has been better than expected, the energy sector continues to show challenges,” said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock.
Investors remain cautious, however. The run-up earlier this month made stocks more expensive than investors are historically comfortable with. The S&P 500 is trading at 18.5 times its expected earnings for the next year, noticeable above the 12-14 times investors typically look for.
The presidential election will continue to grow as an issue for markets in the next several months. Investors dislike uncertainty, and the unexpectedly close presidential election and mostly unknown policies of Donald Trump puts them on edge.
Next week another fifth of the S&P 500 will report their results, including Proctor & Gamble, General Motors, Kraft Heinz, 21st Century Fox and Allstate, among many others.
Moore also pointed out the July jobs report, released August 5, will give investors direction since the June and May jobs reports showed two clashing directions for the US economy.
Japan’s central bank ended a policy meeting Friday by announcing it will expand purchases of exchange traded funds from financial institutions to help inject more cash into the world’s third-largest economy and pursue its 2 percent inflation target. But the measures fell short of hopes for more aggressive action. That helped the yen surge as investors priced in fewer yen in circulation. The dollar dropped to 102.03 yen from 105.45 yen.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury note falling to 1.46 percent from 1.51 percent the day before.
In energy trading, benchmark US crude reversed earlier losses and was up 46 cents to close at $41.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 24 cents to $42.46 a barrel in London.
Heating oil rose less than 1 cent to $1.28 a gallon, wholesale gasoline futures rose 1 cent to $1.32 a gallon and natural gas fell was little changed at $2.88 per thousand cubic feet.
In other currencies, the euro rose to $1.1179 from $1.1073 the day before and the British pound rose to $1.3239 from $1.3148.
The price of gold closed up $16.70 to $1,349 an ounce, silver rose 16 cents to $20.31 an ounce and copper rose a penny to $2.222 a pound.

NEW YORK: Five years after United Airlines and Continental merged, the company’s new CEO declared in a public letter that the combined company has failed to live up to the expectations of both fliers and United’s employees.
Just three weeks into the job, CEO Oscar Munoz acknowledged in full-page newspaper ads that “the journey hasn’t always been smooth.”
Since the merger, United has been plagued with chronic delays, computer outages and dissatisfied workers, who have a reputation for taking out their frustrations on fliers. The problems overshadowed the tenure of former CEO Jeff Smisek, who took over the combined airline when the merger closed on Oct. 1, 2009.
On Sept. 8, Chicago-based United Continental Holdings said Smisek was ousted following an internal investigation into the airline’s dealing with the public agency that operates its hub airport in Newark, New Jersey. That agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is part of a federal investigation into abuse of power. Munoz, a railroad executive and head of United’s audit committee, was named president and CEO.
In his letter, which ran in national newspapers, Munoz didn’t offer any hints as to how he will actually fix United’s many problems except that he will listen to fliers and employees.
“We are committed to re-earning your trust,” he wrote.
The company set up a website, UnitedAirtime.com, for people to ask questions and provide feedback to the airline. The airline posted a few questions and answers in advance of the site’s launch that focus on delayed luggage delivery, aging airplanes that lack Wi-Fi or working TVs and the poor quality of first-class meals.
“Let’s be honest, the implementation of the United and Continental merger has been rocky for customers and employees,” Munoz says on a video greeting on the site. “While it’s been improving recently, we still haven’t lived up to our promise or our potential.”

WASHINGTON: US manufacturers expanded at their slowest pace in two years last month, held back by faltering global growth and cutbacks in oil and gas drilling.
The Institute for Supply Management says its index of factory activity fell sharply to 50.2 in September from 51.1 in August. That is the lowest level since May 2013. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders and production both fell sharply and a measure of hiring also declined, according to the ISM, a trade group of purchasing managers. All three still barely remained in expansion territory.
US manufacturers are getting hit by slower growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy, and a stronger dollar, which makes US goods more expensive overseas. Oil and gas drillers are also cutting back on their orders for steel pipe and other goods in the wake of sharply lower oil prices.
China’s factory activity contracted last month, according to a survey of its purchasing managers, though its manufacturing index inched up to 49.8 from 49.7 in August.
Manufacturers cut 15,000 jobs last month, the most in five years, payroll services provider ADP said Wednesday. The government will release its jobs report Friday, and economists forecast it will show that the economy added 206,000 jobs overall.
The unemployment rate is expected to remain at a seven-year low of 5.1 percent.
Most economists expect US manufacturing will do little for the economy for the rest of the year, with the possible exception of automakers. But so far, healthy consumer spending on cars, homes and restaurant meals is offsetting overseas weakness and driving modest growth.

Are we utilising resources to the best of our ability?
As Shahrukh Khan stated in the blockbuster film, ‘Chennai Express’ — “Don’t underestimate the power of a common man”, the financial markets can deliver the same phrase with a twist. Don’t underestimate the power of information! In the age of technology and information, the world of traders has been enveloped by numerous data and reports. Life, as the traders know it, has been surrounded by scores of data emancipating from various economies and every second matters in the race towards accomplishing profits. With the passage of time, global markets have provided innovative ways to look at the markets and the fundamentals within it. Given that global markets are operating 24 hours a day and five days a week, inevitably investors will enhance their knowledge levels.
In recent times, during market operation, information does stem out from every corner of the globe with astounding pace that traders need to keep an eye on every major economy around the globe. Given the markets is a convergent point for the constant flow of information, investors should weigh the data and incorporate the ones which one feels will be imperative to his trading strategies. Easier said than done, the preceding sentence might leave some readers with a raised eyebrow and an immediate question — how do I weigh the information or how can I know the importance of such information?
In the first few trades, it is important to follow the impact of such information and wait to enact on the appropriate trade. With experience, the trader will learn the importance of such information and incorporate similar strategies in the ensuing days too.
But given the importance of the word ‘information’, are we utilising resources to the best of our abilities? Having undertaken numerous training classes related to the markets, I have noticed that participants have not been keeping themselves updated with the latest developments from around the globe. It is next to impossible to throw the dart expecting to find the bull’s eye when darkness has clouded the room. However, with light, the task of finding the bull’s eye becomes a tad easier. Information is the light, guiding traders and making the process of trading more effective.
A mentor once said — “information from the markets, if interpreted and processed in the right manner, will always reap greater results in the forthcoming days.” In contemporary times, processing the given information is a major challenge for the prevailing investors. In theory, trading seems easier but when theory has to be converted into practice, life does not seem to be easy. However, with experience and practice, one will surely master the art of trading from the given processed information. Hence, information is the most important commodity in today’s global financial world.

FOREIGN AID PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT IS YET TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC
KATHMANDU: Foreign aid is considered a key factor in enhancing competitiveness of development projects and expediting economic activities especially in least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal. However, when it comes to utilisation of foreign aid or its effectiveness, Nepal still seems to be far away in the picture.
Over-dependency on foreign aid has made the people parasites. But when it comes to utilising aid (both loans and grants) productively for self-reliance, Nepal is lagging behind. As foreign aid is composed of loans and grants, of the total commitments, Nepal has been able to use less than 50 per cent as of now. Do our institutions have capacity to use it properly and and timely manner? This is the million dollar question.
The top five multilateral agencies to provide aid to Nepal are mainly the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, UN Agencies and Global Fund (GFATM). These agencies always feel privileged to give aid to Nepal but they also put strict conditions for effective utilisation to enhance economic activities and support economic growth.
The economic survey for the fiscal year 2014-15 shows that outstanding debt of Nepal in the form of foreign debt and domestic debts stood at Rs 545.31 billion by fiscal year 2012-13. This had increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 553.50 billion in fiscal year 2013-14. It also shows that outstanding debts seem to be on the rise. The share of foreign loan stands at over 61 per cent in the fiscal year 2012 to 13. It indicates that per capita outstanding debt stands at Rs 20,068.00 in the fiscal year 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey for 2014-2015.

Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation

Total grants that Nepal received in the fiscal year 2013-2014 stood at over 42 billion rupees, according to government documents. Now the question that arises is whether we have utilised these grants productively for the economic development of Nepal. It is also being monitored by donors and development partners. Donors’ intentions are to enhance the capacity of Nepal and that needs to be measured and monitored while giving additional aid in future.
Though Nepal is the top country in South Asia to register highest revenue GDP ratio (which stands at 18 per cent of total GDP), the revenue is all consumed for recurrent expenditure. So, the time has come to use foreign aid in capital formation and also save some money out of revenue mobilisation (reducing unnecessary expenses) for economic advancement.
The quality of foreign aid has increased after the implementation of the ‘Foreign Aid Policy – 2002’. However, there are still some problems associated with the management of aid by implementing agencies. Lack of proper recording system, conditionality associated with aid, and lack of transparency in spending are some serious issues that should be addressed by the government in the days to come for making foreign aid more effective.
One of the key problems on the part of donors is transparency which is yet to be maintained. On the part of recipients as well, there are complaints. Donors feel the outreach and transparency is weak according to reports produced by donors and they are losing confidence in Nepal.
As foreign aid plays a critical role in infrastructure development such as highways, power plants and airports, the realisation is yet to be appreciated by the public. Deficit financing is another critical part of budget management. Of the total budget, the foreign aid composition in the current fiscal year’s budget is estimated at 25.1 per cent (Rs 206 billion). In such a situation, we should think seriously to use foreign aid with focused strategy.
It is high time the government check funds being spent by INGOs and NGOs on the pretext of utilising for needy people or sectors. There is no reliable account of the amount of aid used by these agencies which needs to be properly recorded after the implementation of the Development Cooperation Policy 2014 (DCP 2015).
Though some international agencies are currently focusing on trade rather than aid, Nepal also as a member of WTO needs to think seriously about diversification of aid utilisation strategy and utilise such funds in productive sectors jointly with investors. It will surely support to attract foreign direct investment and infrastructure for sustainable economic growth in a changed globalised regime.

Two is always better than one. When it comes to making a powerful impact, one needs to learn to effectively coordinate and collaborate. In every session, our aspiring change makers meet and learn from like-minded individuals and get exposed to new avenues to foster collaboration, expand their ideas, and maximise their efforts. Currently, our participants are working with various organisations and communities to implement their ideas and reach out to the right people with the right solutions and right attitude.

Martina Gautam
Morning shows the day. Youngest amongst the 13 girls, Martina Gautam believes in giving her best in whatever she does. A recent high school graduate, she wants to pursue Biomedical engineering in her undergraduate studies. Head strong about her goals, she leaves no opportunities behind to achieve them.
When EmpowHER came around, she knew what she needed to do. The idea of sharing the same platform with other like-minded women and learning new things excited her. She joined EmpowHER with a hope to improve her leadership skills, and bring back her experience and understandings to her students.
She has been working as a teacher since the last three years at a women’s school in her neighbourhood. Many of her students work as domestic helpers in dif ferent houses in the community. In exchange for school fees, many young women from rural Nepal travel to the capital to work as domestic helpers. Despite mistreatment and abuse, these girls stay with their host families so that they can receive free schooling. But most of them do not even get to go to school, and even if they do they cannot concentrate and lag behind in their classes due to over workload. Therefore, through her EmpowHER ‘Impact Service Project’ Martina will provide free coaching classes to help these girls with their assignments and class works including sessions on ESL, mathematics, and computer courses. Based on their performance in the coaching classes, she will provide
scholarships to few students to support their tuition fees. She hopes her effort will
help at least few young women to pursue education without being forced into domestic labour.
For her, EmpowHER has exceeded her expectation. It has offered more than she had anticipated, helping her gain more clarity about her goals and herself.
Change maker #10:
Nisha Bhatt
Reap what you sow. Nisha Bhatt who is a second year Bachelor’s student of Social Science knows that to get good results you need to put in good effort. Passionate about
social change, she believes that a society can only be progressive when women are
given their basic rights without hesitance.
Through her ‘Impact Service Project’, she wants to create awareness about “Chaupadi”, an old tradition that banishes women during their menstruation forcing them to live in a sheds or outbuildings. They have limited food, poor sanitation, and are vulnerable to wild animal attacks and sexual harassments. Despite being
outlawed in 2005, many families in Western Nepal still practice this detrimental and life threatening tradition. She wants to pilot her project in Mashfal VDC in Dolpa, where many women have lost their lives to Chaupadi. With the help of her project, she will be providing awareness trainings in the community to help women overcome the social pressure to practice such traditions, and establish an understanding of menstruation as a biological process rather than a regressive social practice. She will also provide trainings on women health and how women can take care of themselves while they are menstruating. She hopes that her efforts will help the community gain a different perspective on women menstruation, leading to both behavioral and social change towards such practices.
She joined EmpowHER to empower herself so that she can enable other women in the community. Through EmpowHER she has been able to strengthen her interpersonal skills, better herself as a leader, and develop ever lasting sisterhood.
As the journey of EmpowHER progresses, we see the passion, focus, and the sense of responsibility towards the community brewing strongly in our participants. We are confident that these change makers will leave no stones unturned to make a powerful impact anywhere they go.

EXPERTS OPINE THE LOSS INCURRED BY THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE CALCULATED AS EVERY SECTOR WILL HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACT
KATHMANDU: As Nepal promulgated its new constitution through the Constituent Assembly on September 20, people from different quarters welcomed it. The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution not only because the country got rid of the long-standing transitional phase but also because the constitution is directly connected with the fate of the country and its citizens. The private sector has pinned high hopes on the new constitution and that it will fast track the country on the road to economic development and prosperity.
However, the private sector is seriously concerned about the prolonged bandh for over a month in the Tarai. The bandh has not only halted imports and exports but has also largely affected industries in the region.
The private sector claims to have borne a loss of around Rs 70 billion and counting because of the unrest. Moreover, the government is also losing revenue.
Revenue hit
According to the Department of Customs (DoC), the government has missed its revenue collection target by 35 per cent in Bhadra (mid-August to mid-September). Although DoC had set a target of collecting Rs 17.08 billion in revenue in the last month, it was able to earn only Rs 11.2 billion, which is 35 per cent less than the target. “We could not meet our revenue collection target for the last month due to the Tarai bandh,” said Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Director General of the DoC, adding, that if problems continue to persist it will be tough to meet the target.
According to him, the government has set a target of collecting Rs 205 billion in revenue by the end of this fiscal year.

“By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
PASHUPATI MURARKA, president FNCCI
” Already affected by the April earth-quake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai”
RAJESH KAZI SHRESTHA, President, NCC
“Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected.”
MANOJ KEDIA, vice president, CNI

All sectors affected
“The private sector is excited about the promulgation of the new constitution as the country has successfully come out of a prolonged transitional phase,” said Pashupati Murarka, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest umbrella organisation of the private sector. Stating that the Tarai bandh is a major problem for the economy, he said, “Now is the time to focus on the path of economic development and prosperity.”
Citing that the private sector has been losing around Rs two billion per day due to the strike, he said, “The prolonged Tarai bandh is a discouraging sign for the private sector.” He informed that the environment for investments is deteriorating day by day. “We have been urging the   government and concerned parties to resolve all the issues as soon as possible,” he said, adding that if the existing situation continues for long then the economy of the country will be badly hit. He stressed, “By now, we should have got rid of all political instability and focused on the rapid economic development of the country.”
Experts opine that the loss incurred by the country cannot be calculated in precise amount as the bandh has affected every sector and will have long-term impact on the economy. The industrialists and traders have been urging the government to create an environment to run their industries, as manufacturers have been compelled to stop taking consignment of goods from the international market. Moreover, most industries are reeling under the shortage of raw materials.
Economic viability questioned
“The new constitution has restored confidence in the private sector,” said Economist Bishambar Pyakurel, adding that the existing situation though is discouraging. “The way federal structures have been developed, it does not seem to be economically viable,” he said. Citing that there will be huge revenue expenditure gap among development districts, he said, “Around 32 per cent of the total development districts will meet merely five per cent of their expenditures.” According to him, the central government will have to take the huge burden of these development districts to empower them.
He is of the opinion that there is no real calculation of the economic loss caused by the ongoing Tarai unrest. Citing that the inflation rate is skyrocketing in double-digits, he stated, “There is no relation between inflation and government policy. It is out of control.” However, he is quite optimistic about the economy of the country. “Once the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy of the country will takeoff.”
Losses piling up
Due to the prolonged protest in Tarai, a large number of imports lie stranded at Kolkata port of India, Nepal’s only gateway for third country trade. Importers are compelled to pay high demurrage charges to the port authority and shipping liners with their goods stuck at the port yard since a long time. If things do not improve for the better, the country’s economy will have a tough time to move ahead at a pace to ensure development and prosperity of the country.
“The private sector is excited with the promulgation of the new constitution but at the same time it is worried about the prolonged Tarai bandh,” said Rajesh Kazi Shrestha, President of Nepal Chamber of Commerce. Citing that there is no account of how much loss the country has incurred during the last month, he said, “Both industries and trade have been badly affected by the bandh and we will have to bear the long-term consequence.”
“Already affected by the April earthquake, the economy of the country has again been victimised by the political unrest in Tarai,” said Shrestha. According to him, both the government and agitating parties should resolve the issues through dialogue as soon as possible and let the country move on the path of economic development and prosperity. “As soon as the Tarai unrest is resolved the economy will start to improve,” he opined.
“Every single industry has been closed or affected for over a month due to the Tarai bandh,” complained Manoj Kedia, Vice President and Spokesperson of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), adding that the majority of industries are on the verge of collapse due to billions in losses. “Since most industries in the country and major custom points are located in the Tarai, the national economy has been badly affected,” he added.
Blaming both the government and agitating parties of being irresponsible, he said, “Neither government nor agitating parties are serious about the degrading economic situation of the country.” Citing that the life in the Tarai has become hell, he said, “We are tired of bandhs. Bandh is not the solution to any problem so the agitating parties should resolve their issues through dialogue.” According to him, if things don’t improve soon, the country will have to bear a huge economic loss.

105,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/how-to-make-a-bad-advertisement/,"KATHMANDU: Coca-Cola recently came up with a campaign, Labels are for cans, not people”. For a brand like Coke, which probably holds all world records for ‘Most Recognised Brand Insignia of All Time’, promptly removing its brand’s name from products altogether would not only be a bold move, but a very wise marketing strategy too. Whether this campaign became a success or a huge laugh is subjected to discussion for which I need to take a rain check, but one thing is certain: this campaign does not stand exemplary to any other brands worldwide.
Perhaps, a move like this might be fatal to brands from the rest of the world.
The problem with bad advertisements is not that they take a bold leap of faith entering into the consumer psyche with a creative edge too sharp to handle, but take that leap without a proper harnessing tightrope. The rule of thumb of any advertisement tells that its communication line should not drift too far away from product’s unique selling proposition, the USP. But that’s where the problem lies. Two competing products can come up with similar (if not same) USPs, meaning: they will have similar communication line. You can already guess where I am headed with this. Two different products, from two different companies will have similar looking advertisements. Wise eyes can spot similarities within milliseconds.
This is how bad advertisements are made. The art department of an advertising agency comprehends the need to ‘stand out from the crowd’ just like Coke did, but the business development department exhibits tenacity to not allow ‘going over the top’ disobliging the brief. Not being able to arrive to a common ground delivers an advertisement either too flaccid or too twisted to grasp.
Making a good advertisement means determining the right velocity of creative momentum versus the steadfast doggedness of a layperson, hence good advertisements hit the media only once in a blue moon. Perhaps knowing how to make a bad advertisement tips the scales towards better creativity and enhanced business development brief. Here are some instructions as to how to make a bad advertisement:
Monopolise the palette: Putting everything you have in one plate and eating it like khichadi makes a bad advertisement. When you give more than one information from one advertisement, people will not see a clean and crisp communication but a product catalogue.
Make something creative and explaining it: Creativity should be self sufficient. If you start explaining why you have put a graphic element, or an impromptu headline, or an out-of-the-place icon from your body copy or via voice over, then the automatic context of the commercial is lost.
Art is for art’s sake: But not for commercials. Commercials need to have an artistic knock, but if the business aspect is lost within the art, then it reflects a bad advertisement. Commercials exist to sell the product, not the creative director’s caliber.
Misunderstanding the USP: The word ‘unique’ needs to serve a purpose. You cannot sell toothpaste by saying ‘it makes your teeth sparkle’. Any given toothpaste needs to do that. If it has outlandish alien mineral in it, then maybe it is unique. Otherwise it becomes as bad a commercial as it can be.
Trying to kill two birds with one stone: This is ‘the’ golden example of a bad commercial. One advertisement can never sell two products. Either the audience understands the communication of only one product, or relinquishes the effort to understand altogether. Remember seeing a whisky’s advertisement, and also seeing a vodka bottle there? You might. But you will not remember their names.
A great advertisement for a bad product: There are hundreds of examples out there. If your product does not have potential but campaigns for a great advertisement, then false hype of the product heads for the downfall of impending creativity. Subsequently, the feedback for the advertisement is bad.
Ideas are prolific: Any Tom-Dick-Harry can come up with it, and that’s what makes an advertisement bad. Ideas alone cannot yield creativity. and business. For both of them to work, attempting to steer clear from a bad idea is a must. Maybe it will not be great tomorrow morning. But eventually, it will.

106,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/swot-analysis-of-nepals-hydropower-industry/,"THERE IS NO CLARITY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S PLANS AND PROGRAMMES FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT
KATHMANDU: Nepal is a typical example of a country endowed with rich natural resources, but living in poverty due to the failure to create a conducive investment climate for hydropower development. The hydropower potential of Nepal is sufficient not only to provide for electricity to households, industries and businesses but also to allow substantial quantities of surplus electricity for exports. Hydropower when developed will be an important revenue generator and an essential element of poverty alleviation and economic growth.
STRENGTHS
According to a conservative estimate, domestic power demand in Nepal is estimated to grow by 10 per cent. We have neighbours, India and China, with huge economies and a large appetite for energy. Growing worldwide climate change concerns make hydropower more acceptable electricity option.
OPPORTUNITIES
Nepal is poor, only because it is poorly governed.
Bhutan’s per capita income has increased substantially in the last few decades, thanks to the export and sale of hydropower to India. If Nepal’s grid system is integrated with the Indian grid system and power traded in India, there will be multiple benefits for Nepal like revenue generation, rapid industrialisation, energy security, employment generation import substitution of fossil fuels et cetera.
Recent projects show growing interest from China as builder and financier in Nepal’s hydropower development. There should be no problem for financing and power market if we can make the potential investor happy by offering competitive investment climate.
WEAKNESS
Generally, Nepal’s rules, regulations related to investment seem to be investor friendly. However, although the investment laws protect property rights and ensure recourse to legal system implementation, enforcement of these provisions is another matter.
Investors feel frustrated due to delays in the processing of documents like permits, approvals, clear-ances et cetera.
There is no clarity on the government’s plans and programmes for hydropower development. For example, Nepal has no energy strategy plan to streamline hydro-power development and there is no regulatory commission to regulate the power sector.
Due to the absence of a power trading company, independent power producers are compelled to sell electricity to Nepal Electricity Authority.
The hassles related to land acquisition and clearance for Environment Impact Assessment is enough to kill the enthusiasm of a potential foreign investor. The transmission lines inside Nepal are yet to be expanded and upgraded to evacuate power   from new power plants.
To sum up the constraints, Nepal still has miles to go in terms of doing business.
THREATS
The country needs to develop its hydropower potential with a sense of urgency. The hydropower sector could not develop due to the long period of insurgency and relatively long period of transition, following the comprehensive peace accord.
Still many rules and regulations related to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydropower are missing. For example, the absence of laws related to project financing make large scale financing in Nepal’s hydropower development very difficult.
Many potential investors argue that Nepal is not yet ready for FDIs in hydropower. It is to be noted that there are more than 100 countries for investors to invest in. They are always in search of ‘green pastures’ for investment. They will not invest in Nepal only for the love of our country if the investment climate is not good enough.To sum it ip , Nepal does not offer investor friendly platform to support large scale Hydropower development.
 CONCLUSION
As a result, what could be a vibrant, thriving economy, Nepal has become a stagnant economy, struggling industrial base and unacceptably poor living standards particularly in rural areas. We must seize the opportunity to invite investors by offering them competitive incentives and investor friendly environment.

107,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/trade-with-confidence/,"IT IS SEEN THAT TRADERS FOCUS ON RESULTS RATHER THAN PROCESS

KATHMANDU: Trade outcomes cannot be assured. The market might be predicted up to some level but its result is uncertain. You entered a market with full preparation to come out successful and it happened to be same as predicted but it can be the other way too; you entered a market with full study and analysis and relied on probabilities to come out successful but it had an unexpected outcome. The nature of trading is like that. Due to its nature and effect on the psyche of human being, it is essential to have a lot of self-confidence.
Self-confidence is an element which is required in every field to excel. Without this underlying competence, a person cannot grow and be ahead. It is rightly said that ‘Without confidence, we can do little in life. With it, we can change the world’. Confidence is a tool which when used in trading can have a positive impact and help to improve the performance thereon. Self-confidence in trading is the ability to focus on improvement and better performance thereby keeping self away from negative thought patterns like fear, greed, anxiety, et cetera.

Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade

Many traders have the misconception that winning trades develop confidence but the fact is just the opposite. More winning trades come from a dedicated focus on the process of trading where traders develop their skills and in doing so, develop their confidence. Focus on the process of trading is very important but very often, it is seen that traders focus on results rather than process. Soon if a trader sees a loss or two in a strategy they attempted, they will discard the strategy. This attitude leads only to frustration. So, in the phase of trading it is quite important to understand how we learn. Learning does not start at point A and steadily progress to point B; it is not a linear. Learning occurs in a series of ups and downs. We grow a little, fall back a bit, advance some more, take breaks and this is how it goes.
Other thing which leads to confidence development is positive thoughts. Most confident traders look at the brighter side of the things rather than feeling bad and cursing themselves for a losing trade. They don’t have a negative outlook. Rather they are quite optimistic and try to learn from their mistakes. It is said that positive outlook brings out positive result and the same applies to trading too. So instead of burdenning your mind with negative thoughts and wasting your time, be positive and think of how you can plan your trade better and follow it properly.
Develop self-confidence and you will see a better performance in your trade!

108,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/investment-tips/entrepreneur-juggler/,"“START SMALL, REALLY SMALL. TEST YOUR BUSINESS MODEL BEFORE YOU REACH OUT TO THE MASS.”

KATHMANDU: Amun Thapa, 27, owner/co-owner of five companies combined suggests that he is an ‘entrepreneur juggler’. When asked what it means, he states, “Someone who is constantly juggling between several ventures. At present, I manage Sasto Deal, Sasto Book, Irish Pub, Chhahari Production and Anthropose. A few other interesting projects are in the pipeline.”
Before asking him how he manages to look after all of these, I was curious to know where he started. Amun, I discovered, sees things in black and white without much grey areas. “For any problem, there are two approaches — to complain or to seek for solutions. I have always taken the latter approach. I never intended to become an entrepreneur. But the problems I personally faced in Nepal and elsewhere got me to come up with solutions, and hence the businesses I am involved with,” he shares. He says that getting where he is today was not an easy task. In his own words, “The first and foremost hurdle, when starting a business, is to understand the local legal and tax systems. Nepali entrepreneurs still do not have a clear understanding of how they should go about when it comes to taxation. It is a shame but also a reality that most businesses operate without proper registration and billings. This makes it difficult for other businesses to work. Also, finding the right employees is another major challenge here, apart from building culture.”
Amun shares that getting investment for a start-up in Nepal was a daunting task. He blames the regulations set by the Central Bank for Foreign Direct Investment and suggests that the easiest route is to seek for investment among friends and family. With profit margins depending on the venture/start-up, Amun says that the first year of the start-up, he did not care much about the profit margin but diverted their efforts in generating brand awareness. He shares, “This is when the advertisement costs are at their maximum. But to put it in numbers, a venture must seek at least 10 per cent to 40 per cent profit margin for it to be sustainable and scalable.”
On employees he says, “The smartest thing to do is ignore the resume because it tells nothing about an employee. We hire them on the basis of their performance during their internship period (which usually lasts for two months). Most of them come through referrals. We also have performance incentives to encourage employees to work at their level best. As for salaries, I believe everyone deserves to be paid well, like the saying goes — if you look after your employees, they will look after your clients.” He opines that he would definitely focus more on technology if he had the chance to start over again. “Over the past four years I have witnessed consumers adapting to changes in technology. People have taken to Facebook and Viber for communication, apps are replacing websites, and such. I was talking to a hotel owner in Pokhara yesterday and he told me, one of the first things people ask for after checking-in is the WiFi password.”
When asked about the Nepal’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, Amun says diversification is the key. “Nepal is now not only relying on tourism and hydropower and banking industries as income generating businesses but there are a lot more new industries that were introduced to the market in the past several years. Therefore, we are definitely on the right track.” His words of wisdom for the ones starting out are, “Start small, really small.
Test your business model before you reach out to the mass. Focus on building systems because this comes in handy when you are scaling your businesses. And always give priority to your brand because revenues can go up and down but your brand is what keeps you going.”

Altice expands in US with USD 17.7 billion Cablevision deal
European telecoms group Altice will become a major force in the lucrative US cable market after it agreed to buy fourth-largest operator Cable vision for a mix of cash and shares in a deal worth USD 17.7 billion including debt.
The move is the latest foray by French-Israeli billionaire and Altice founder Patrick Drahi, who built a telecoms and cable empire in recent years via debt-fueled acquisitions in France, Portugal and Israel.Drahi entered the United States in May by buying small regional cable group Suddenlink for USD 9.1 billion and had declared he would do more acquisitions so as eventually to earn half of Altice’s revenue there.
GM to pay USD 900 million settles US criminal case
General Motors Co (GM.N) has agreed to pay USD 900 million and sign a deferred-prosecution agreement to end a US government investigation into its handling of an ignition-switch defect linked to 124 deaths, two sources told Reuters. The deal means GM will be charged criminally with hiding the defect from regulators and in the process defrauding consumers, but the case will be put on hold while GM fulfills terms of the deal, one source said. No individuals would be charged in the criminal case, one of the sources said. The company’s expected USD 900 million payment, confirmed by a second source, is less than the USD 1.2 billion that Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) paid to resolve a similar case.

Global stocks at three-week highs as Fed decision looms
World stocks inched to a three-week high on Thursday while the dollar drifted lower against other currencies, as investors consolidated positions ahead of a nail-biting US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. There was a sense of relief as much as anything that after months of market speculation and advice from almost everyone from the IMF to the heads of the world’s top companies, that the wait for the Fed’s verdict would be over by 1800 GMT. Europe’s main share markets were left at a virtual standstill with Britain’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 all barely budged after two days of gains helped by a flurry of merger activity.Currency and bond market moves were low key too.
Wal-Mart worker group splits in two
A Wal-Mart Stores Inc worker group that has been one of the loudest voices pushing the retailer to boost wages and improve conditions has splintered over a disagreement about funding and strategic direction, according to people on both sides of the split. Both wings are claiming the name OUR Walmart and vow to continue their work, moves that could sow confusion among supporters.The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which for years has provided important funding and resources to the OUR Walmart worker group, will only financially support the wing that it believes represents the broader set of workers. “Recently we had a group split from us,” said Barbara Getz, who said she is head of the health and safety team for the OUR Walmart grouping that is sticking with UFCW.

AUSTRALIA

US Fed may not hike interest rates
The Australian share market has surged ahead of highly anticipated US Federal Reserve rates call, as energy stocks soar on a strong bounce in crude oil prices. Investors remain upbeat approaching the US Federal Reserve’s decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, with financial markets predicting a 30 per cent chance of lift-off. At the 4.15pm (AEST) official market close, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 added 47.9 points, or 0.94 per cent, to 5146.8 points, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 47.6 points, or 0.93 per cent, to 5171.2 points. The growing sense that the US Fed may not hike interest rates has also pushed the Australian dollar above US72c for the first time in three weeks as per The Australian.
Australian shares rose 1.5 per cent on Thursday for a second straight day of gains as all sectors rallied ahead of the US Fed’s interest rate decision later in the day. Banks and miners were among the clear winners with the “Big Four” lenders rising more than two percent in early trade. A jump in oil prices pushed energy stocks higher. The S&P/ASX 200 index added 73.83 points to 5,172.7 by 0215 GMT. The index closed 1.6 per cent higher on Wednesday, and is on track to post a second straight weekly gain. Analysts said the market could claw back some of the day’s gain as the near-month futures contract expires on Thursday and could add some volatility. Asian stocks hit a three-week high on Thursday after a jump in oil prices lifted Wall Street, with many investors taking last-minute positions ahead of the Fed’s policy decision.

BANGLADESH

Secretary of state for treasury ministry
According to The Daily Star, Poland is interested in investing in mining, coal extraction and installation of liquefied natural gas terminal in Bangladesh as the European country has experience in the sectors, a deputy minister said yesterday. Zdzislaw Gawlik, secretary of state for the treasury ministry, also said his country is keen to explore shell gas in Bangladesh. “We are bringing in very solid proposals of investment in Bangladesh,” he said. “I know Bangladesh is developing at a faster rate. So we are working at the government-to-government and business-to-business levels to intensify bilateral relationship.”
Tea prices in Bangladesh edged higher for a second straight week at the weekly auction on Tuesday amid tight supplies and strong demand for quality leaf. Bangladeshi tea fetched an average 187.93 taka (USD 2.4) per kg at the 19th auction of the current marketing season, slightly up from 185.81 taka at the previous week’s sale when the prices snapped seven-week losing streak, an executive with National Brokers said. There was huge demand for quality tea, while volume dropped again this week compared with last week, helping prices to perk up, the executive said. About 1.93 million kg was offered at the sole auction centre in Chittagong, of which 6.5 per cent was unsold. In the previous auction, about 10 per cent of the 2.17 million kg offered went unsold. The national budget for the 2015/16 fiscal year that started in July raised the regulatory duty on tea imports by five per cent to discourage overseas buying. Tea prices fell sharply in the last marketing season on poor demand from local buyers as business sentiment was hit by renewed political unrest early this year that left more than 120 people dead and disrupted supplies. The country, however, has moved from being a net exporter to a net importer of tea due to rising consumption.

CHINA

Activists rally ouside the White House
China’s economic powerhouse is slowing, destabilising global markets. Beijing’s neighbors, unnerved over its pursuit of territorial claims, are increasingly cosying up to Washington. A threat of US cyber sanctions looms over Chinese companies. It might seem an ideal time for US President Barack Obama to take advantage of Beijing’s troubles and get tough when he hosts Chinese leader Xi Jinping for a state visit on September 25. Obama is expected to press Xi on issues that have strained relations between the two countries, but his approach will be tempered because for better or worse the world’s two biggest economies are inextricably bound together. That will mean a difficult balancing act for Obama. He is under pressure to send a strong message to Xi over cyber spying, Chinese economic policies and South China Sea disputes, but he does not want to upend a summit that could set the tone for relations for his last 16 months in office.
Just as China shows that its domestic stock market can be something of a one-way street — investors can put money in, but not take money out — the biggest mutual fund company, Vanguard Group, is moving ahead with plans to expose more mom-and-pop investors to the country’s heavily restricted exchanges. With the Shanghai stock exchange down by 37 per cent and the Shenzhen exchange off by 43 per cent during the past three months, compared with just an 18 per cent drop on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, Vanguard is adding China mainland stocks to its USD 60 billion emerging markets fund in the coming year.Vanguard says adding A-shares — stocks that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, as opposed to those that trade on the Hong Kong exchange — will diversify the fund, but acknowledges they pose unique risks related to tracking a benchmark. Steps taken by the Chinese government to restrict trading on domestic exchanges make it difficult for index funds to buy the stocks they need to replicate the performance of Chinese benchmarks, fund executives said.

EUROPE

Nestle fails to convince European judges
According to The Guardian, Nestlé has failed in an attempt to convince European judges to let it trademark the shape of the four-finger version of a KitKat in the UK. The European court of justice ruled that the KitKat’s shape was not distinctive enough for consumers to associate it with the chocolate covered wafer. Nestlé is not seeking to trademark its two-fingered version of KitKat. Nestlé had argued that even without its red and white packaging or the word KitKat embossed on the chocolate, the shape of the bar should be regarded as distinct. The dispute between Nestlé and Cadbury, which has fought to prevent Nestlé securing a trademark, will go back to the UK high court for a final ruling that will determine whether rivals will be able to launch copycat KitKats in Britain.Despite the court’s failure to allow the trademark, Nestlé said it was pleased with the ruling.
International creditors expect the first review of Greek reforms under the latest bailout to start in October, bringing changes to a memorandum of understanding signed with Athens and paving the way for debt rescheduling talks, Euro Zone officials said. Euro Zone finance ministers will discuss preparations for Greek reforms envisaged by the third bailout, worth 86 billion euros (USD 96.8 billion), at an informal meeting in Luxembourg on Saturday. No implementation review is possible before Greece’s September 20 parliamentary elections. “There are elections in Greece. We have to wait for the results,” Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna, whose country holds the EU’s rotating presidency, told Reuters in an interview.

INDIA

Reserve Bank of India headquaters, Mumbai
India requires sustained low inflation and a credible programme for fiscal rectitude to lower the cost of capital, Urjit Patel, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said on Thursday, striking a hawkish note after government calls for interest rate cuts to boost the economy. The central banker also said in a speech to a business conference that he expected India’s current account deficit to be 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product in the 2015/16 fiscal year. New banking licences issued by the RBI were also aimed at lowering the cost of capital, Patel said. His remarks addressed concerns that commercial banks have failed to pass on recent cuts in the RBI’s main policy rate to their borrowers.
India plans to address some pending tax disputes in the next few days, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday, but did not give details or say whether the cases in question included disputes with foreign companies that have spooked investors. Earlier this month, the finance ministry decided not to press claims for a Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) against foreign portfolio investors. India remains locked in major back-tax battles with telecoms group Vodafone (VOD.L) and Cairn Energy (CNE.L). Arun Jaitley said last week that the government was trying to resolve pending tax cases, many of them outside the courts.

JAPAN

Workers are seen in a container area at a port
Japan’s exports slowed for a second straight month in August in a worrying sign that China’s economic slowdown could deal a damaging blow to the world’s third-biggest economy and force policymakers to inject fresh stimulus before too long. The data joins a string of depressing shipment numbers in key regional economies — including South Korea and Taiwan — which has heightened anxiety over a China-led slowdown in global growth and tempered bets of the US Federal Reserve lifting rates for the first time in almost a decade later on Thursday.Slowing exports could increase the chance of additional monetary easing from the Bank of Japan, because this could lead to lower factory output, slack economic activity and less momentum needed to offset deflationary pressure caused by a collapse in oil prices.
Vietnam agreed with Japan on Tuesday to step up security cooperation, becoming the latest Southeast Asian country to seek closer ties with Tokyo as China maintains an assertive posture in disputed waters in the South China Sea. The agreement between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Vietnam’s Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong comes after a US expert said on Monday China appeared to be carrying out preparatory work for a third airstrip in contested territory in the South China Sea. China has overlapping claims with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei in the South China Sea. It is also embroiled in a row with Japan over a group of East China Sea islets. Earlier this year, Japan reached an agreement with Malaysia and the Philippines to strengthen security ties.

Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Thursday ahead of a likely policy move by the US Federal Reserve, with stocks in Malaysia outperforming and Singapore hitting a more than one-week high as a big jump in global oil prices boosted energy stocks. Oil prices jumped as much as six per cent on Wednesday after a US stock draw. Oil bulls were also encouraged by doubts on whether the Fed will decide to hike US interest rates on Thursday after tame August inflation data. Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur composite index was up 2.1 per cent on a rally in oil-related stocks. The index touched 1,691.93, a near six-week high, on resuming trade after a market holiday. Shares of oil and gas services firm Sapurakencana Petroleum Bhd was up seven per cent and Tenaga Nasional Bhd was 2.3 per cent higher, among top gainers.
While Malaysia’s premier faces tough questions over the origin of hundreds of millions of dollars transferred to his bank accounts, the country has tentatively received good grades for its anti-money laundering efforts from a team of international experts, documents reviewed by Reuters show. A draft report by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body which monitors how countries fight illicit financial flows, said Malaysia had put in place a “robust policy framework” to combat money laundering.But it said the Asian country needed to be more effective in targeting high-risk offences and needs to pay more attention to transnational crime. The draft, dated Aug 4 and marked for official use, said the FATF inspection team found the Malaysian government had a “strong political commitment and well functioning coordination structures” to fight money laundering and that “significant resources have been allocated” to investigations in this field.

RUSSIA

Launch of new Opel Astra to boost sales
General Motors (GM.N) executives said they remained committed to meeting their goal of reaching profitability in Europe by 2016, brushing aside concerns that a downturn in Russia could put their goal at risk. “We are confident about reaching our goal,” Opel Chief Executive Karl-Thomas Neumann told journalists at the Frankfurt auto show on Tuesday. In July, GM warned its European employees the Opel and Vauxhall brands were still posting significant losses, and meeting its goal of returning to profit by next year would be difficult given the crisis in Russia and the Euro Zone. But General Motors President Dan Ammann said on Tuesday the launch of a new Opel Astra would help boost sales.
Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc on Tuesday said it expected to complete its new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a soon-to-be banned Russian engine, but the date could slip if it does not receive enough US government funding. Aerojet Vice President Julie Van Kleeck declined comment on reports that Aerojet has offered USD two billion to acquire United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 rocket launch venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Analysts say the bid is a strategic move by Aerojet to shut out rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, that is developing a new engine favored by ULA for use in its new Vulcan rocket. ULA has said Blue Origin’s engine programme is about two years ahead of Aerojet’s work on the AR-1 engine, a claim Aerojet disputes.Work on the new engines gained urgency after US lawmakers passed a ban on use of Russian RD-180 engines for launches of US military or spy satellites following Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine last year.

PAKISTAN

Pakistan and Afghanistan have shelved a raft of agreements that promised to more than triple cross-border trade, officials said, as economic ties seen as key to regional stability fall victim to rivalry and suspicion. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani struck the trade deals with Pakistan soon after taking office last year as part of a broader rapprochement that included plans to share intelligence on Taliban insurgents active in both countries. That cooperation was aimed at tackling the Islamist militant movement, which has separate Afghan and Pakistani branches whose violent campaigns kill thousands of people each year and hamper much-needed development. The trade deals were supposed to be a step towards warmer relations and boosting Afghanistan-Pakistan trade from USD 1.6 billion now to USD five billion by 2017. But officials told Reuters that the agreements, which include reducing tariffs and granting each other preferential trade status, have stalled.
Pakistani farmers will receive USD 3.2 billion in grants, subsidies and loan advances from the government, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced on Tuesday, in a bid to spur sluggish growth in one of the country’s main economic sectors. The new schemes represent the government’s largest economic development programme for the agricultural sector since it was voted into office in 2013.The funds will be provided through immediate cash grants and subsidies on agricultural inputs worth USD 1.4 billion, while loan advances worth USD 1.85 billion will also be made and disbursements begin this year, he said. “The conditions of the agricultural sector do not inspire confidence,” Sharif said as he announced the new package at a farmers’ convention in Islamabad. The package includes immediate cash grants for rice and cotton farmers, cuts in fertiliser prices, and a government scheme to pay insurance premiums for farmers who cannot afford them.

THAILAND

TAC plan expansion of it 4G mobile network
Thailand’s Total Access Communication Pcl (TAC) said on Thursday it is planning a major expansion of its fourth generation (4G) mobile network, as it seeks to displace rivals Advanced Info Service Pcl and True Corp. The country’s second largest mobile operator, controlled by Norway’s Telenor, has received regulatory approval to provide 4G services on the 1800MHz frequency band, which is currently used for 2G, Chief Executive Officer Lars Norling told a news conference. TAC also plans to increase its number of base stations to 32,000 in early 2016 from 17,000 now, aiming to provide 4G network coverage nationwide.
The Asian Development Bank will lower its 2015 GDP growth forecast for Thailand from the current 2.9 to 3.0 per cent following weaker-than-expected performance in the first half, the Bangkok Post reported, citing Luxamon Attapich, the bank’s senior economist for Thailand.The new growth forecast, due to be announced on Sept 22, will be higher than 2.5 per cent, the paper reported.

USA

A women walks past the FR headquaters
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has made clear she would rather delay an interest rate hike for too long than move sooner and risk jeopardising a tepid economic recovery, a conviction that will face its sharpest test yet on Thursday. Having weighed the economy’s steady march toward full employment against the backdrop of weak inflation and wage growth and turbulence overseas, the US central bank will issue its latest rate decision at the end of a two-day policy meeting. A rate hike would be the first in the United States in nearly a decade. Fed watchers, however, see the outcome as a toss-up, with Yellen’s consistently stated desire to see workers reap more benefits from the recovery, coupled with weak price rises and a variety of global risks, looming large. “It is a game-time decision. The key is what Yellen thinks and my guess is that she will want to wait,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. “If you put yourself in her shoes, you don’t want to make a mistake by going too soon.”
Oil prices were stable on Thursday as a US stock draw tightened the market while Asia’s economies showed new signs of weakness.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading at USD 47.13 per barrel at 0430 GMT, virtually unchanged from their previous close, while Brent was up 6 cents at USD 49.81 per barrel. That followed a price jump of as much as six per cent in the previous session when data from the US Energy Information Administration showed the largest crude drawdown since February 2014 at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point. Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures said that the stock draw was “a result of higher refining activity and lower US crude production which is helping the US inventory glut to ease off”.

110,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/analysis/striking-a-balance/,"By working only 66 days a year, will we be able to prosper?
KATHMANDU: Many dailies across the country published articles on the total number of bandhs in Nepal between April 2010 and April 2015, which stood at a whooping 1,047 days. What were these 1,047 days after all? They were certainly a reflection of limited opportunities to participate in the country’s politics and be heard. In this regard they were an outcome of sluggish institutionalisation of democracy. However, what has now become alarming is that the effect has started perpetuating the cause, further slowing down political processes and thwarting our opportunity to find peaceful solutions through democratic institutions. In the meantime, it is causing the immediate threat of depriving a large number of people of their livelihood opportunities.
WILL WE BUILD A PROSPEROUS NEPAL BY WORKING JUST TWO MONTHS A YEAR?
If we take the total days in five years, it comes to 1,825 days. When we deduct 52 Saturdays, take 37 official public holidays per year on an average and number of bandhs in the past five years, which is 1047, we would have 333 days left as proper working days in five years. This means only approximately two months per year! Add ‘chiya’ breaks, scrolling one’s ‘Facebook newsfeeds’, Tweets, Youtube, Whatsapp and power naps, and of course, 30 days of annual leave, we had less than a month dedicated to productive work on an average in the past five years.
What will happen to the big dreams of eradicating poverty and turning Nepal into Switzerland in x number of years?
DO WE COMPENSATE THE MEAGRE WORK HOURS WITH PRODUCTIVITY?
According to the World Bank, the annual GDP of Nepal in 2014 year was USD 19.6 billion. If we are able to generate USD 19.6 billion GDP in this limited window of productive time, had we worked four months a year, we could have doubled our GDP as well. Despite all markets, offices and industries being closed during bandhs, we managed to get a figure of USD 19.6 billion. If we managed to sustain a whole year by two month’s work, our productivity must be exemplary. May be our work culture is not unproductive after all. But empirically it shows otherwise. Labour productivity in Nepal is low, it ranked lowest in South Asia in 2010.
IF NOT PRODUCTIVITY, ARE WE A GROUP OF VERY WISE CONSUMERS THEN?
If it is not the productivity argument, to explain our sustainability despite the general shutdowns, we could look from a consumption perspective. Is it because we have stable priorities, and know when and what to buy that we have sustained so far? Do we have the answer to all the questions economists spend years researching consumer preference, behaviour and utility? We do not.
Even if we were the wisest bunch of consumers, it is hard to think that two months of work can sustain us for a whole year.
IS IT THE REMITTANCE THEN?
So what could it be? Could this be due to the influx of remittance from abroad, which has added for financial sustenance both for individuals and the government? According to the World Bank, remittance received as a percentage of GDP stood at 29 per cent in 2013. It seems that with the current rate of general shutdowns and dwindling productivity, had it not been for remittance, Nepal would have plunged further down into poverty.
When people in the country cannot work due to the bandhs, they are forced to send an active member of their families to work abroad. Secondly, the prevalence of bandhs is a reflection of weak enforcement of rule of law and property rights. Therefore,these general shutdowns have become a prime factor in pushing us into the vicious circle of poverty and weakening the economy.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
With the alarming rate of 209 days of bandhs per year, it is astonishing how our economy breathes. Nothing adds up. Neither labour productivity justifies our performance, nor do the consuming habits reflect our sustenance. A portion of viable reason attributes to remittance, yet its channelisation does not.
One reason why the bandh toll reached 1047 in the past five years is the apparent success rate of this protest method. But how long will we allow the interest of one organised group to succeed at the cost of an unorganised and peace-loving majority?
It has been estimated that one-day of bandh brings loss of about Rs 1.8 billion which means in the past five years, these general shutdowns have robbed people off of 1,884 billion rupees. This is alarming for a nation where people are leaving in hordes looking for economic opportunities in other parts of the world.  Will a ‘new’ federal Nepal be able to set a stage for institutionalising political processes and democracy in such a way that being heard does not necessarily mean pushing fellow citizens towards a more impoverished life and robbing them of their fundamental rights?

KATHMANDU
Public institutions are a perquisite for accelerating economic activities to cause sound economic growth, however, their poor quality in executing development programmes remain one of the biggest challenges in Nepal that has resulted low performance in spending. Inefficiency on the part of key ministries and personnel associated with such bodies along with outmoded working style has dampened the potential economic growth. Despite Nepal being ranked highest in registering revenue-GDP ratio in South Asia, she seems poor in enhancing economic growth.
Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up
If we go by the statistics of the Economic Survey for the fiscal 2014/15, revenue mobilisation in Nepal stands at 18 per cent of GDP. Inability to effectively implement planned yearly activities with deteriorating work culture among officials engaged with implementing-agencies has pushed economic growth to a low. Finance Minister Dr Ram Sharan Mahat delivered a highly-acclaimed lecture last week at a book launch titled ‘Macro Economics: A Radical Rethinking in Growth, Inequality and Inclusiveness in Nepal’ edited by Professor Dr Bishwambher Pyakuryal. Critical assessment of economic growth, existing models along with critical binding constraints were debated at length at the gathering of academicians.
A worried minister Mahat did not forget to criticise eroding capacity of implementing agencies to spend qualitatively despite the availability of enough revenue mobilisation/resources. Economists continue their debate on growth, inequality and inclusiveness to unlock the potential for registering sound economic growth.
Though debated widely, reasonable growth is yet to be seen. Current national accounts do not seem to be able to capture all new innovations and growth of service sectors or seek timely revision. As the GDP growth of Nepal stands at around three per cent currently as per the budget for 2015/16, the target to achieve six per cent after the devastating earthquake seems unthinkable, thanks to the weak spending capacity of implementing agencies and sluggish moves by the Reconstruction Authority. With increased politicisation in every sector of the economy, Nepal is now crying for quick remedy from all quarters to stick to work culture.
In the fiscal year 2013/14, the country failed to spend Rs 82.19 billion. That shows how inefficient our administration is in executing development programmes, as per the Financial Comptroller General’s office. The major ministries to spend less than 80 per cent of their allocated budget are the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Commerce and Supplies, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and Ministry of Finance. The total allocated budget for the fiscal 2013/14 stood at Rs. 517.24 billion according to Ministry of Finance 2013/14.
Lack of proper monitoring of expenditure by the ministries has affected real progress in public service. Now the serious question that arises is in regard to spending of budget allocated in their plates. Are the ministries efficient and competent enough to work as per the target — who will answer this? Money is the blood of the economy, therefore, no agency has the authority to stop spending public money on productive sectors.
The pressing need now is to improve the capacity of government officials and reform mechanisms for enhanced development activities by adopting appropriate models. Only talking about revenue generation does not achieve economic growth because we have already failed to implement planned activities. This may continue to increase if we do not overhaul the existing bureaucratic set up. As per economic trends in the past 10 years, economic growth rates hovers at around three per cent, and the blame ultimately goes to the leaders and bureaucrats in institutions occupying key positions.
The five-pillar applications (use of latest technologies, security of private property/investment, democracy, external sector focus and progress in the health sector as propagated by the Finance Minister might be a stepping stone for Nepal to unlock increased potential for sound economic growth. The existence of structural rigidities need to be refurbished for efficiently employing a correlation between wage and productivity, monetary policy and inflation, growth and inequality. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of government agencies, improving facilitation with the business sector and managing and monitoring development activities are other key areas of reform along with removing policy ambiguity. The foremost priority of Nepal should be the economy coupled with sound business environment. As the current economy is thrilled with remittance that stands at 29 per cent of GDP, this money is not used in productive sectors for sustainable growth.
Affected by the devastating earthquake and with low absorption capacity in the development sector, Nepal needs to gear up to spend for improving internal capacity. Though challenging, augmenting capital investment and a proper understanding of economic agenda by politicians are critical factors to shape the future of the economy and trickle down benefits to the resource-starved people.

KATHMANDU
Traders are simply investing their time, thinking that if they spend a lot of time around the markets, analysing charts, reading books and studying courses, their skill level will improve. Investing time is necessary when you are starting out, as there is a lot to learn. But putting in hours will not necessarily increase your profit potential. If you always repeat the same mistakes, putting in hours will just be meaningless with those habits in place. To improve, make repeated and deliberate choices. Here are five things to start doing today to improve your trading performance.
GET HELP
Trading is tough and not a cup of tea for everyone especially when we go at it completely alone. So choose a person who could be just a friend or family member who you have told your plans to and who you keep updated on your performance. Share what you are doing, what you are struggling with and what you are having success with. Anyone can get side tracked, so be open to being told when you have gone astray. When your own discipline and self-awareness fails, you will have someone to help you get back on track.
FOLLOW YOUR PLAN
Talking about strategies with other traders or discussing your performance with your trading referee is fine, but avoid the opinions of others when it comes to specific trades. Trade your trading plan, your way. It doesn’t matter if a trader you respect says they are going to buy when your plan says to sell.
PRACTICE
A strategy may seem simple on the surface, but even a simple strategy is hard to implement in live market conditions. Every day, every trend, every pullback is slightly different; nothing looks exactly the same as it did in the textbook examples. So trade it in a demoaccount until you consistently see profit from it.
MENTAL CLARITY
Each day take one minute before you trade to make sure you are feeling clearheaded and focused. Also take a couple of seconds to reiterate that you’re here to trade, not check your social media accounts, email or watch videos online. When you trade, simply focus on trading and leave other matters. Check the economic calendar to be aware of events that may move the market, so you are not taken by surprise during the day. If you are angry, upset or unfocused, avoid trading. It only takes one day, one trade even, to lose an entire account when not in the right mind frame.
RECORD YOUR TRADE
Review every trade you make. Take screenshots of your trades with entries, stop loss levels, targets, and your technical/fundamental notes so you can easily review your trades at a later time.

KATHMANDU
Hear it verbatim from Rajesh KC on how he aspires to build a world-class Nepali brand.
“I have been drawing cartoons since 1990s. Back then they were limited to my friend’s portraits but once I got the platform, I was able to polish my skills and dedicate my time and energy to the same. It has been 25 years now and I recently expanded the skills I have to something new.”
On Phalano Luga: “Phalano Luga came to me as a pleasant surprise. A friend of mine who owned a t-shirt store asked me to design a few prints for t-shirts. While designing, I thought to myself, ‘He might give me royalty and I might make some money out of the designs but why not create a Nepali brand in itself?’ I visited stores for market evaluation and realised that even though Nepal has a lot of talent in terms of designs, the fabric was not up to the mark. Even though the t-shirts had tags that said, ‘100 per cent cotton’, something was amiss. Phalano Luga came into existence with an ambition of creating a Nepali brand for Nepalis to wear. With the fabric imported from Ludhiana, India, and the manufacturing factory located in Patan, I have been able to give the market what I had in mind. The printing machines are imported from California and are top class and that is how I had imagined my brand to be — uncompromising and pocket-friendly.”
On growth: “Initially, I had a target of selling at least one t-shirt per day. I thought that the concept of a Nepali brand might take some time to build but I am surprised with the exponential growth Phalano Luga has seen. In the past two years, my dream of selling one t-shirt per day has topped 30 t-shirts per day.”
On workers: “This is one of the bigger challenges I face. Retaining workers and getting the best ones is a big challenge. A group of Nepali workers are coming back to Nepal from Malaysia to work with me. Apart from retaining them, paying them the same amount they used to earn overseas is a challenge. The people I am working with right now are also working with the production unit of Nike, Adidas, Peter England and other such global brands, based in Nepal. The problem is not the quality of the workers, but the economy and the quality of local materials available.”
On funds: “While starting the business off, my bank was skeptical about giving me a loan. My capital investment was close to one crore and after convincing the bank, I had 30 per cent of the costs covered. Most of the funds were drawn from my own pockets.”
On new ventures: “As of now, with more than satisfactory sales, I have the confidence of expanding my business across the country and abroad. But my first priority would be maintaining the quality for a while before dreaming big. Phalano Coffeeghar which is the latest addition to my business venture is something I am looking up to for now. With Phalano Luga doing well, I partnered with an old friend, Prem Aryal and opened the cafe last week. I had the space and he had the ideas, we got together and came up with the Coffeeghar plan. Like the tees, the eatables available at the cafe will all be Nepali-centric. Long term plans for this cafe are branded water bottles and sugar sachets.”
On the future: “I aspire to make Phalano Luga as big as Nike and Adidas.”

Kathmandu
With the country in dire need of post disaster economic recovery, it is expected that governing bodies address the concerns of major contributors to the GDP. The advertising industry is one such sector with the potential to help with economic recovery; and could provide a significant push towards an economic boom, just as the country needs it the most.
Advertising helps create successful businesses, which then lead to employment opportunities. Even media, the driving force behind growing economies, benefits from stability in the industry, as advertising is the chief source of revenue for mass media like newspapers, television, radio, print magazines and websites. Research has consistently shown that countries with larger investments in the advertising industry are more developed than other countries. For instance, the advertisement industry in the United States creates 18.2 million of the 126.7 million jobs. However, back home in Nepal, the predicament of the advertising industry is such that the government is yet to give due recognition to the industry.
According to the Advertising Association of Nepal (AAN), the total annual revenue of the advertising
industry is Rs 5.5 billion. While it is an industry with vast potential; it appears to lack order with various unresolved issues brimming under the surface.
The present scenario
Although at a very slow pace, the industry was witnessing growth before disaster struck. Post earthquake, the scenario looks far from encouraging. Is there a noticeable difference in the industry before and after the earthquake? Ranjit Acharya, CEO of Prisma Advertising says, “Before the earthquake, the industry was in its growing stage. Growth was rather slow but it was growing
nonetheless. Post earthquake, advertising agencies had to cut down on budgets, as it was the need of the hour. With no help from any quarter it was a necessity to cut down costs.” According to him, most businesses had to cut down on advertising budgets, which led to stagnancy in the industry. He says, “A person must seek medical help when ill and not cut down on medicinal costs. The same is with
advertisements.”
Deependra Tandon, Director of Business Advantage says, “In the first few months after the disaster in April/May we did not have any business. We have gradually recovered now and we hope that the business will revive in the festive season.” He adds that the business is still in its infancy and there is room for improvement.
Ahimsa Yonjan, Managing Partner at TBWA\Benchmark Nepal, says, “The earthquakes led to a rather disturbing slowdown for a month or two, but considering everything that has happened, the industry looks to have weathered the storm rather well”. He adds, “However, as an industry, we do not seem to have learned much from the experience, as there is actually very little difference in communication styles or brand behaviour before or after the earthquakes.”
The mushrooming of advertising agencies
AAN has 298 advertising agencies on its member roster, but there still exist several hundred more agencies that are not registered with the association. With so many advertising agencies operating in the market, it is still generally accepted that most of the advertisements that are produced in Nepal are not satisfactory. On this, Santosh Shrestha, President of AAN says, “Because there is no entry barrier to this industry, anyone can register and have an agency up and running in no time. While this opens a lot of doors for newcomers it leads to compromise on the quality. It becomes a tough job to monitor quality.” He further says, “The world of advertising is creative and fascinating. In Nepal, the industry has an estimated growth of 10 to 15 per cent annually. If we focus on quality control, nothing can stop this industry from growing in the coming years.”
Advertising agencies and advertisement standards
On the compromised quality of advertising and agencies not being up to the mark, Shrestha says, “The quality of advertisement depends of the level of awareness of the society, resources, budget and the economy. Advertisements reflect the attitude of the society. The market is small and the economy is not
progressive. The current focus is on production of effective advertisements rather than creative ones.”
He adds that they are responsible to cater to the mass with limited budget. He says, “Suppose there are three kids who study in grade three, six and eight. Now, all of them must be explained to in a similar manner, in a language they can comprehend. The teacher explains in the easiest way so that every one can understand. The same goes with advertisement.”
Joydeb Chackravarty, Managing Director, JWT – Thompson Nepal has a different view on this subject. He says, “Nepali consumers are exposed to creative advertisements, if not from within the country, but definitely from the world outside. They are intelligent and they know exactly what they want.
Advertisers should not underestimate their level of awareness and should not doubt their intelligence.”
He says that it is high time for the industry to push the envelope in terms of standards and creativity.
Yonjan says, “While I do agree that the overall quality of advertising could be a lot better, I think it is quite unfair to generalise and say that the quality of advertising agencies is not up to the mark. There are a few agencies doing good work locally, so we must give credit where it is due.” He further says, “As with any other industry however, a combination of many factors; such as, lack of industry knowledge and processes, timelines, an unwillingness to provide proper compensation on the side of all parties involved, leads to a large proportion of work being of poor quality. It is the same with art, music and movies. Much of what is produced is quite terrible, but there are those that stand out.”
The clean feed debate
For almost eight years now, AAN has lobbied with the government to introduce a Clean Feed Policy. This policy will ensure content filtering systems that can be used to block foreign commercials aired through foreign channels from reaching the Nepali audience. The main purpose of this policy will be to eliminate the trend of dubbing and encourage multinationals to produce and develop advertisements through local agencies.
Nirmal Raj Poudel, CEO of Welcome Advertising and Marketing, says, “Multinational companies dub foreign advertisements and broadcast them in local channels.  Further, the paid channels also include commercials. This results in quality compromise.”
However, some industrialists claim that clean feed is an uphill task in Nepal. They argue that competition will be killed with the introduction of this policy. A Clean Feed Committee has meanwhile been formed by AAN that has been doing research on the topic and is under dialogue with the government for a quick implementation of this policy.
The right way of doing things
According to some, one of the biggest challenges the industry currently faces is the lack of vision and leadership within the industry. Only self- regulation and quality checks can turn the industry around. Tandon says, “The change must start with the industry itself. Introducing policies is not enough for the development of the industry.” Yonjan has similar views, he says, “We cannot introduce laws to control or fix what are inherently industry problems. What is more necessary is an independent regulatory body that can develop and enforce a code of conduct/best practice model in place for the overall advertising market.”
Although the advertising industry is currently facing an uphill battle, this is still an industry that has enormous potential. With the industry only just beginning to mature, and mediums like digital and new age media opening up, there appears to be much to look forward to for the industry. For the rest of us, it remains the industry to watch.
In parting, it is perhaps Chakravarty who sums it up best — “The next five years are going to be challenging for the advertising industry in Nepal. However, if we follow the right way of doing things and remain honest and integrated there are chances that we can recover soon.”

The monsoon struck the village mid-June, but officials of Sangachowk VDC are still struggling to distribute cash relief to villagers.
Currently, the villagers are living inside temporary shelters made from rusted zinc sheets riddled with holes and timber salvaged from their damaged houses. They kept some zinc sheets and timber to shelter their cattle and poultry after distribution of relief amount was delayed.
Shyam Khadka, 55, of Pokhre said,”The rain water trickles through the zinc sheets. The families of my three sons are housed under one small temporary shelter. Even if the government distributes relief money it will not be sufficient to procure zinc sheets to construct temporary shelters that will accommodate the families of my three sons.”
Basanta Prasad Ghimire, secretary, Sangachowk VDC said cash relief had not been distributed as the registered households claiming cash relief outnumbered the actual damaged households.
“Over 28,000 households have registered for cash relief, whereas, the District Administration Office has allocated cash relief for only 22,000 households on the basis of existing documented records before the earthquake of April 25,” he said.
The government had announced immediate cash relief of Rs 15,000 for one damaged house. The joint families who have not legally divided properties are not eligible for immediate cash relief even if they had been staying in separate houses.
“The joint families who lost more than one house registered fore cash relief under names of different members of the same family,” Ghimire said, stressing that families who had lost more than one house are not satisfied with government policy.
He warned that a monitoring team comprising ward citizens’ forum would be deployed to find such joint families who had registered more than once for the same house before issuing the ID card to claim immediate cash relief and Rs 200,000 to further build a permanent house.
The government released Rs 5.53 billion to the local authorities for immediate relief countrywide in May.
According to District Disaster Relief Committee, the death toll was 3,656 in Sindhupalchowk. About 90 per cent of houses in the district were razed to the ground.

116,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/duplication-in-tax-headings-draws-flak/,"KATHMANDU: The draft of the new constitution has overlooked the concerns related to effective levying of major taxes and duplicated some tax headings in central and state governments, as well as provincial and local governments.
Such duplications might pose a threat to the revenue system once the country adopts a federal structure due to disputes of power allocation between central and provincial government to levy taxes, according to tax experts.
The draft constitution has proposed that excise and individual income tax can be levied by both the central and provincial governments. Similarly, it has also proposed that many other tax headings be levied by the provincial and local governments, like registration tax, vehicle tax and tourist fee.
“Even as related Acts will have to be formulated, the power allocation in the central, provincial and local governments will result in disputes when the laws related to taxes are enforced in the coming days,” opined Rup Khadka, tax expert and the chair of the government-formed High Level Tax System Review Commission. The draft constitution has extended authority to levy taxes, but it is silent on power allocation regarding enforcement, like what portion of the excise duty and IIT can be levied by the province and the portion of the registration and vehicle and land tax that can be levied by the local government.
Giving an example of South Sudan, Khadka said, “The taxes proposed to be levied by the central government were also placed in the domain of provincial government, which led to a dispute. It was later sorted out by forming a task force under the chairmanship of the finance minister of the centre, comprising finance ministers of provinces.”
According to him, it would be better to extend the authority to levy a certain tax to a particular government that can effectively levy that duty. “That power can be shared among other governments.”
The HLTSRC has suggested the finance committee of the Parliament to put customs, VAT, excise, corporate and individual income tax under the domain of the central government for effective enforcement, as these taxes are of stra-tegic importance and strong institutional mechanism is required to levy them effectively. Likewise, registration tax and vehicle tax have been recommended to be levied by provincial government.
Who is to levy what
Central government: Customs, excise, value added tax, corporate income tax, individual income tax, passport fee, visa fee, penalties and royalty of natural resources Provincial government: Wage tax (which covers large portion of individual income tax), land tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, excise, entertainment tax, advertisement tax, tourist fees, agriculture income tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources
Local government: Land and rent tax, registration fees, vehicle tax, service fees, tourist fees, business tax, entertainment tax, penalties and royalty of natural resources

117,https://thehimalayantimes.com/finance/development-bond-yields-fall-to-all-time-low/,"KATHMANDU: Yield on development bonds, regardless of their maturity period, has fallen to an all-time low, dampening sentiment of bankers, who have to tap the government securities market to meet some of the regulatory requirements.
Return on 15-year development bonds floated today by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) dropped to 2.65 per cent, the lowest since February 1964, when the government first introduced development bonds with a maturity period of five years to raise debt from the domestic market to finance development activities.
Surprisingly, returns on these securities are falling lately even as their maturity period is increasing.
When NRB auctioned five-year development bonds on May 28, the weighted average cut-off rate stood at four per cent. Then on June 4, when it floated seven-year development bonds, the return fell to 3.44 per cent.
The yield further dropped to 3.08 per cent when NRB offered nine-year development bonds on June 11.
The freefall continued on June 25 as well, when 10-year development bonds were floated. At that time, the weighted average interest rate had dropped to 2.99 per cent.
Considering 7.1 per cent inflation of mid-May, returns on these securities are negative in real term.
“Yields on bonds are falling rapidly because of excess liquidity in the banking sector,” Nara Bahadur Thapa, chief of Public Debt Management Department at NRB told The Himalayan Times.
Banks and financial institutions (BFIs) are currently sitting on excess liquidity of over Rs 70 billion. However, a large chunk of this money cannot be extended as loans because it is being used to meet the minimum regulatory net liquid asset to total deposit ratio, or LD ratio, of 20 per cent.
So, BFIs are rushing to grab these low-yielding securities assuming it is wiser to invest funds in bonds and get some returns rather than let them sit in coffers and generate no return.
Lately, what also appears to have exerted pressure on yields is the government’s decision to repay a part of debt.
So far this fiscal, the government has repaid Rs 42.55 billion of debt, including principal, shows the latest NRB report.
On the other hand, fresh government securities worth only Rs 42.34 billion have been floated in the market. This means net borrowing of the government stood at a negative of around Rs 211 million.
“Because of this, BFIs are rushing to replenish their stock of government securities to maintain LD ratio. This is raising the demand for bonds,” Thapa said, adding, “This is another reason for fall in bond returns.”
The falling bond return is, in fact, good news for the government, as it is now able to raise domestic debt at low interest rates. This means the cost of rebuilding parts of the country ravaged by the earthquake would be a little cheaper.
But bankers say this is creating ‘distortions’ in the market.
“Many BFIs that have purchased low-yielding instruments are now carrying a lot of market risk,” said Sashin Joshi, CEO of Nabil Bank.
This is because purchase of nine-, 10- and 15-year bonds is not a short-term investment, according to Joshi.
“And if returns on bonds rise next year, the instruments bought this year will turn into nothing but loss-making tools. At that time, many BFIs will have no option but to sell those instruments at a discount. This may hit their profitability as well,” Joshi added.

KATHMANDU: There is now little doubt that Pashupati Murarka, officiating president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), will take the helm of the largest private sector umbrella body tomorrow.
Murarka taking the lead of FNCCI has become a certainty after the two other contenders — Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar and Bhawani Rana — withdrew their candidacy for the post of FNCCI president from the election slated for tomorrow.
Organising a press meet on Tuesday, Rajkarnikar had announced his willingness to withdraw his candidacy and support Murarka if Rana also did the same. After Rana formally withdrew her candidacy yesterday, Rajkarnikar also formally pulled out his application today.
So, Murarka is the sole contender for the top post of FNCCI and will be announced as the unanimous president tomorrow. It also means that the post of senior vice president, which Murarka held before he took on the role of officiating chief of FNCCI, will be vacant.
Murarka had been appointed as the officiating president after its past president Pradeep Jung Pandey was arrested in a three-decade old corruption charge on March 18.
As per the FNCCI statute, election of the senior vice president should be done within five days of the president’s election. The senior vice president is elected from the executive committee, though the rest of the posts are filled through direct election.
According to FNCCI sources, there is general consensus among FNCCI members to select Bhawani Rana for the post of senior vice president. Leaders of the largest private sector umbrella body have claimed that rifts and groupism that occurred during the past elections will be bridged after the selection of a unanimous chief at FNCCI.

Nepal is hosting the Donors’ Conference for the reconstruction of the country in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes.
“Media reports that there was clash between us and there was lack of coordination while sending invitations to neighbouring countries are baseless. The finance minister and I were supposed to go to India and China respectively. But, I cancelled my visit to China after Chinese authorities informed us that Chinese foreign minister will not be able to participate in the conference due to prior engagement,” Pandey told the meeting of
National Disaster Management and Monitoring Special Committee of the Legislature Parliament headed by Speaker Subas Chandra Nembang today.
Finance Minister Mahat said that his ministry had prepared the 300-page Post Disaster Need Assessment, with the help of more than 200 experts divided into 23 sub-panels by working round the clock in view of the conference. “This is the official document of the government detailing the damage and need assessment. This document has created the base to see support from donor countries and inter-country agencies,” Mahat said.
The government has invited 65 countries and inter-governmental agencies, said Finance Mahat, adding: “Of them, 125 delegates of 40 countries and agencies have already expressed their commitment to participate in the conference”. Seven minister-level participants have sent their confirmation to participate in the conference, according to Mahat.
“Initially, donor countries wished to delay the conference to August-September. Citing the devastating earthquake situation, they proposed to hold the conference in New Delhi of India, Tokyo of Japan and Paris of France. They were reluctant to participate in the conference expressing their doubt over the safety of the participants as the situation had not been normal. However, we persistently stood on our stance of holding the conference in Kathmandu and made all arrangements for their safe living during their stay here. Ultimately, the donors were convinced and are expressing their commitment for their participation,” Mahat said.
Mahat said that the government would focus on foreign grant collection, sharing experiences of managing post-disaster situation and solidarity of friendly nations to Nepal’s crisis.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Pandey said that the government wanted to show the international community that the country was safe for tourism and it maintained complete harmony during the national crisis despite having around 125 different communities.
Mahat, responding to a complaint that Russian ambassador in Kathmandu did not get invitation till last Wednesday due to the government’s carelessness, said, “The government, six weeks ago, had emailed all the embassies and ambassadors in Kathmandu, making preliminary request to participate in the conference. The [Russian] ambassador had replied us via email that the country’s representative would not be able to participate in the conference due to pre-scheduled engagement on the conference day. Then, we did not send invitation to him. But, after we heard about the complaint, we have sent an invitation recently.”
Lawmakers including CPN-UML’s Madhav Kumar Nepal, Nepali Congress’s Ramchandra Paudel and Unified CPN-Maoist’s Girirajmani Pokharel, had urged the ministries to clarify the controversies related to the conference and suggested them to make the conference a success.
After listening to the two ministers, panel Chair Nembang instructed the government to take the neighboring countries and donors into confidence and also consultations with all the parties and take their feedback. Nembang also instructed the government to make an arrangement for making the foreign delegates observe the major tourist areas — both damaged and not damaged — independently during their visit to give a message that Nepal is safe for foreign tourists.

The ordinance will now be sent to the President for certification.
The Authority, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister, is being set up prior to the international donors’ conference, scheduled for June 25, which aims at seeking support from the international communities to rebuild Nepal.
When the ordinance is certified, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala will nominate four ministers and three experts as members of the high-level body, according to Minister for General Administration Lalbabu Pandit.
Likewise, Vice-Chairperson of the National Planning Commission and Chief Secretary will be members of the Authority.
The post-earthquake Reconstruction Authority will have a chief executive officer also. It will oversee all reconstruction works in the earthquake-hit districts where physical infrastructures have been damaged.
Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam informed that there will be a separate committee of foreign consultants that would be constantly supporting the Authority in its job.
According to the government’s assessment, the tremors caused damage worth Rs 513.38 billion to physical infrastructure and assets, and inflicted income loss of another Rs 187.08 billion.
The government has set the target to collect more than Rs 666 billion in assistance from the international donors for the post-earthquake reconstruction, rehabilitation and rebuilding.
 Objectives of International Conference on Nepal’s Reconstruction


Appraise friendly countries and development partners of the socio-economic situation in Nepal in the aftermath of the massive earthquake and share international best practices and experiences on institutional arrangements that lead to effective, transparent and accountable execution of reconstruction programs.
Disseminate the findings of the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA).
Update the Government’s policies and institutional mechanism for post earthquake reconstruction and new construction
Seek technical and financial support for reconstruction and rally the support and solidarity of all friends and partners for a resilient recovery of Nepal and its people.

Data released recently by Nepal Police revealed that registered numbers of suicide cases have increased by 33 per cent in the past few years in the country.
According to police, as many as 5,754 cases of suicides were registered with the police in 2018-2019. Compared to the data of 2014-2015, the number has increased by 1,422 registered suicide cases (33 per cent). As many as 4,332 suicide cases were registered in 2014-2015. In 2015-2016, the number rose to 4,680.
The number of suicide cases rose to 5,124 in fiscal 2016-2017 whereas as many as 5,317 suicide cases were registered in 2017-2018.
The number is large as suicides in groups are registered as a single suicide case by the police. For an instance total number of 5,785 people had committed suicide in 2018-2019, although police recorded only 5,754 cases. This is because suicides in groups are counted as a single case, according to police.
Data also revealed that at least 31 people committed suicide in group of two or more.
As many as 1,861 people have committed suicide since July 17 till November 16 of the current fiscal year.
Doctors working in mental health sector have pointed out number of reasons for the rise in suicide cases.
High expectations, inability to cope with societal changes, mental disturbance, anxiety, drug addiction and business loss were some of the major factors responsible for the rise in mental health problems in people, they said. Dr Basudev Karki, consultant psychiatrist at Mental Hospital, Lagankhel said, “Most of the causes of suicides are mental health problems. If timely diagnosis and treatment is given to patients the number of suicides can be reduced.”He said that growing frustration due to poverty, unemployment, failure in exams, financial problems, migration, extramarital affairs and complex modern lifestyle were some of the common causes for people to commit suicide.
“However we can’t point out a single cause for suicide. We need to look at multidimensional aspects of suicide,” said Dr Karki. “Suicide is mostly associated with mental illness. But it can be prevented if early diagnosis and treatment is done,” said Dr Phanindra Prasad Baral, chief of Non-Communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under Department of Health Services.
“To reduce the number of suicide cases in the country, mental health programmes should be carried out at community level. Stigma and discrimination on mental health problems should be discouraged,” said Dr Karki.
To prevent mental health problem the government has allocated Rs 90 lakh for each province.

The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority has directed local levels not to reappoint any school teacher who retired from service as part of the golden handshake scheme offered by the government.
An inquiry conducted by the anti-graft body suggested that some community schools had reappointed temporary teachers, who could not attain permanent status through open competition for years, at the behest of the concerned local levels. According to a report of the anti-graft body, municipalities and rural municipalities were indulged in creating new positions and appointing teachers without complying with the prescribed criteria and procedures to provide jobs to the relatives of local level office-bearers. “No local level or school is authorised to create new positions of teachers in contravention of the number of posts sanctioned by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology,” the report read.

As per the Local Government Operation Act-2017, local levels shall only adjust the position of teachers and support their capacity development. “However, some of the local levels were found to have appointed and transferred teachers. It is strongly suggested that the Education Rules-2002, be fully complied with for appointment and transfer of community school teachers,” it read. Some local levels have misused state resource by providing schemes for physical infrastructure development to schools which were not entitled to such facilities, either due to low number of students or for already possessing required infrastructure.

Despite concerted effort by rights activists, government and non-government bodies against sexual violence, number of rape cases registered with police have increased by over 146 per cent in the past six years.
Right activists and police attribute the increase in rape cases to more victims coming forward to lodge complaint against rape. Police record showed a total of 905 rape cases were recorded in 2013-14, which increased to 2,233 in 2018-19, an increase by 146 per cent. Rape incidents increased by 50 per cent in 2018-19, in comparison to the previous fiscal where 1,480 rape case were reported.
Number of rape cases have witnessed an unprecedented rise in the current fiscal year. Police have already recorded as many as 752 rape cases and 267 attempt to rape cases from Mid-July to Mid-November in 2019- 20. Number of rape cases recorded in the first four months of the current fiscal is just 153.
Police had recorded only 154 rape cases throughout the country 15 years ago. Mohana Aansari, a member of the National Human Rights Commission said although consciousness among girls and women to report rape crime has been increasing, many rape cases go unreported due to lack of proper reporting mechanism. “Rising number of rape cases being reported to the police suggest rise in rape incidents across the country,” Aansari said.
Meera Dhungana an advocate and women rights activist said although regular activism might have inspired more rape victims to come forward, rape incidents have also been increasing across the country.
“Only a few women and girls, who would otherwise remain silent fearing stigma after being raped might came forwarded to file the case due to their raised level of awareness. But, a large number of women from rural area and under privileged background or those who are victims of incest seldom report their abuse to the police,” said Dhungana, adding that rising number of rape cases reported to police suggested that rape incidents were on the rise.
DIG Bishwaraj Pokharel and spokesperson of Nepal Police said rise in the awareness level of the victims and support from their family had encouraged more women and girls to file complaints against the crime. “It is true that there has been increase in rape incidents across the country, but it is also true that more rape cases, which otherwise would go unreported, have been reported to the police these days,” Pokharel said. He added that misuse of social media was one of the key reasons for the rise in rape incidents in the country. He said fake rape cases have also repo

The government has increased housing capacity of prisons to 15,466 from 11,300 under infrastructure development programme.
According to a report of the Ministry of Home Affairs, newly constructed infrastructure had provided space for 4,166 more jailbirds over a period of one year. With the increase in holding capacity of prison houses, the government expects to tackle the rising number of prisoners and other inmates serving immediate custodial sentence. The MoHA said construction of a prison building with the capacity of 300 jailbirds would be completed within current fiscal.
Despite increase in housing capacity of prisons, 74 jails with a total capacity of just 15,466 persons have been crammed with at least 23,775 inmates, including 1,269 foreigners, as of mid-November.
“The government will soon start construction of a prison house with capacity for 300 inmates. Prison houses are also under construction in Sarlahi, Sindhuli, Dolakha, Sindhupalchowk, Palpa, Manang, Mugu, Dolpa, Surkhet and Jajarkot. We hope that the problem of overcrowded prisons will be solved within a few years,” the report read.
The process of relocating the Central Jail to Nuwakot is also picking pace, of late. The government has already obtained 539 ropani land for the Central Jail. The prison facility, with capacity to house 7,000 prisoners, will have five blocks, including one for females. The MoHA said one of the blocks with capacity of 1,500 persons would be completed by mid-July next year.
“The government is doing groundwork to implement the concept of open prison. Administrative and infrastructure work have been initiated for this purpose,” the report stated. An open prison is a penal establishment where prisoners, who have served at least half of their jail term and have demonstrated good conduct, are trusted to do their time with minimal supervision. It aims to ease the pressure of jailbirds in crowded prisons and to turn prisons into correction centres.
According to the Department of Prison Management, it has been working on a draft of guidelines on open prison, which will be submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs for approval.
National and international rights bodies have long criticised the government’s poor handling of jailbirds. Increased crime rate has led to overcrowded prisons. The country has 74 prisons in 72 of 77 districts. According to the National Human Rights Commission, jailbirds have been deprived of basic amenities and rights, including sanitation, room space, quality food and regular health check-up.
Many prisons lack space for jailbirds to sleep conveniently. Jailbirds have not been given access to sports, entertainment materials and books for their education.

Nepal Communist Party (NCP) Chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal today proposed holding the party’s general convention by mid-April 2021.
Dahal put forth the proposal in his 11-page political document presented in the meeting of the party’s standing committee that kicked off today after one year.
Dahal has proposed streamlining work of the party, departments, sister organisations and all other party fronts in the run-up to the general convention.
According to NCP Standing Committee member Devendra Paudel, Dahal has also proposed running a three-month nationwide campaign for which involvement of all bodies of the party will be sought. After the three-month campaign, preparations for the general convention will begin. Dahal has proposed organising central committee meeting by mid-February which will finalise the work plan for the three-month campaign. The campaign will see gatherings, training and meetings in all 77 districts.
Dahal’s political document has attributed losses in recently-held by-elections, especially in Dharan and Bharatpur, to delay in completing party unification. He stated this had resulted in lack of coordination among party bodies. “The losses have had a negative impact on the party,” read Dahal’s political document. It also mentioned that the delay resulted in factionalism and betrayal.
To strengthen the party, Dahal has proposed extensive training on Marxism and Leninism and on the party’s strategic goal. He also stressed publication of the party’s mouthpiece.
The document adds that the party would head towards communism through its immediate programme of socialism-oriented people’s democracy, said Paudel. Dahal also proposed disciplinary action against those speaking or writing against the party as part of his proposal to strengthen unity in the party.
The NCP has, probably for the first time, made Nepal-India border-related issues part of its political agenda. Dahal’s political document states that Nepal will not tolerate encroachment of Nepali territory.
Stating that India breached the Sugauli Treaty by including the Kalapani region within its territory in the recently-published Indian political map, Dahal said the issue should be resolved through political and diplomatic channels.
On foreign relations, Dahal proposed that Nepal should adopt non-aligned foreign policy and take advantage of rapid growth of India and China. He stressed friendship with all.
The standing committee meeting also saw NCP General Secretary Bishnu Paudel presenting a proposal to amend the party’s statute. The party’s central secretariat had on December 9 decided to amend the statute, including two major provisions — goal of communism and creation of the post of deputy chairperson. The latter paves the way for appointing Bam Dev Gautam as the party’s deputy chairperson.
Earlier in the morning, the party’s central secretariat held at Baluwatar finalised five agendas for the ongoing standing committee meeting. The standing committee will convene tomorrow at 11:00am the party headquarters at Dhumbarahi to discuss Dahal’s political document, statute amendment proposal, central committee meeting and Nepal-India border issues.
“Today’s standing committee saw presentation of Dahal’s political document and Bishnu Paudel’s statute amendment proposal,” said Devendra Paudel, adding that discussion on Dahal’s document, Bishnu’s proposal and other agenda would begin tomorrow. He said the meeting would last at least two more days.
Dahal held a separate meeting with Oli on his political document in the morning. The document was also discussed in the party secretariat. Oli attended the secretariat meeting briefly as he is recovering from the appendicitis surgery.
As the standing committee meeting got under way, leaders criticised the leadership for holding the meeting after a gap of one year. Dahal assured them that the meeting would be held regularly henceforth, according to NCP standing committee member Pampha Bhusal.

Minister of Education, Science and Technology Girirajmani Pokhrel today said education should be linked to production and development.
Speaking at a press meet organised by Press Organisation Morang in Biratnagar, Minister Pokhrel said failure to link education with production had reduced the quality of community schools.
He pledged to strengthen community schools by linking them to job market and production cycle. Minister Pokhrel cited an example of a school in Surkhet that produced honey and supplied it to Soaltee Hotel in Kathmandu.
“If we connect schools with production, they will be empowered,” Pokhrel said. He said the government would provide physical structure, teachers and other necessary facilities to strengthen community schools across the country. He added that the government was planning to merge those schools with few students and operate residential schools for quality and standard learning. “Schools having a few students in mountain and hilly regions should be merged and residential schools have to be run to educate children from far-flung areas,” he added.
Minister Pokhrel said his ministry had made public the National Education Policy after 20 months of intensive study, discussion and consultations.
He claimed the new national education policy would have long term positive impact in the sector of education.
Pokhrel said the government was preparing to table three bills on education in the winter session of the House of Representatives. “We shall table Bill on Higher Education, Bill on Common Education and Bill on Technical Education in the Parliament in its winter session,” said Pokhrel.
Minister Pokhrel acknowledged that the government had failed to produce skilled manpower for nation building. He said that national curriculumn should inclulde 70 per cent technical education.

“We are holding talks with government bodies concerned to designate a separate lane for cycles in Kathmandu. But since the roads are under jurisdiction of the Department of Road, we are not able take quick decision.” He further said he would make sure that some of the road sections in KMC got cycle lanes before his tenure expired. Shakya also urged the municipal employees to ride bicycle while commuting to the office in a bid to encourage others to use bicycles.
The government had, in 2014, declared that Maitighar-Tinkune road segment incorporate a dedicated cycle lanes on both the sides. But these cycle lanes have been used as footpath at present.
Ratna Shrestha, president of Nepal Cycle Society, said although the government announced that it had designated dedicated cycle lanes on the road section, it was not safe for cyclists. “These lanes do not meet the criteria of dedicated cycle lanes. They are similar to footpaths,” he added.

Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Bidhya Sundar Shakya has said that the metropolis will be developed into a smoke-free city by the end of 2020.
He said KMC would be developed as smoke-free since it had become part of  the Partnership for Healthy Cities, a global network of 70 cities committed to saving lives by preventing non-communicable diseases such as cancer, and diabetes, and injuries.
“Improving public health requires bold action,” said Mayor Shakya at a programme organised in Kathmandu yesterday. “We are proud to be part of this group of cities working to ensure longer and fuller lives for people. Through PHC, our efforts in this area will have even greater impact. We are implementing a global blueprint for effective urban health.”
“The road to a healthier world runs through cities. Major portion of the world population now lives in urban areas, so cities have to implement meaningful policies,” said Dr Kelly Henning, who leads the public health programme at Bloomberg Philanthropies. “PHC unites mayors who are committed to action. With its expansion to 70 cities, collectively we are preventing millions of untimely deaths from NCDs and injuries and protecting the health of generations to come.”
A recent study shows that prevalence of tobacco use in adults is 68.4 per cent in rural and 37 per cent in urban areas of Kathmandu. Mayor Shakya has committed to developing KMC as a smoke-free city by December 2020. NCDs and injuries are responsible for eight out of 10 deaths globally. The additional cost per person to implement key NCD policies in low-and lower-middle-income cities between now and 2030 is USD 1.27, while road traffic injuries already cost most countries three per cent of their gross domestic product. Through this partnership, cities commit to one of 14 interventions that address the risk factors causing NCDs and injuries, such as implementing smoke-free laws that protect residents from second hand smoke, restricting sugary drinks and junk food advertising or creating safe urban cycling routes.

The Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration has issued a circular to all district coordination committees and local levels, directing them not to accept assistance or loans from foreign donor agencies/communities or investors without consent of the federal government.
In a response to a letter from the Ministry of Finance citing a recent decision of the Council of Ministers, the MoFAGA urged district coordination committees and local levels to abide by the constitutional provisions and other existing laws related to exclusive and concurrent powers of all three tiers of government. Article 59 (6) of the constitution states that the Government of Nepal shall have power to obtain foreign assistance and borrow loans. Such assistance or loans shall be so obtained or borrowed to maintain macroeconomic stability of the country.
Similarly, Clause 7 of Schedule-5 of the constitution has set down the matters related to international treaties or agreements, extradition, mutual legal assistance and international borders and transboundary rivers as the exclusive power of the federal government.

“The MoF requested the MoFAGA to issue a circular to all the district coordination committees and local levels in conformance with the November 15 decision of the Council of Ministers, citing that there was the possibility that foreign assistance and loans would be accepted without bringing it to the knowledge of the federal government,” said an official at Development Assistance Coordination Section of the MoFAGA.
The official informed that the central government became very cautious about this issue after it came to know that some local levels were planning to sign agreements with foreign donors for assistance and loans by keeping the federal government in the dark.
The Government of Nepal may obtain foreign grants and assistance for plans or programmes to be implemented by the provincial and local governments.
According to Section 12 of the Inter-governmental Fiscal Arrangement Act-2017, provincial and local governments shall not obtain any form of foreign grant or assistance or implement or make to implement any plans or programmes with the foreign grants or assistance, without prior consent of the Government of Nepal, the circular read.

According to the report, it was very urgent to establish trafficking victim support fund at all three levels — central, provincial and local — and operate at least one trafficking victim protection home and rehabilitation centre in each province for the victims suffering from mental trauma. The government has been urged to approve the Anti-human Trafficking Bureau Regulations at the earliest and expand its units to the district level. “We recommend the government to provide specialised criminal investigation training to the police personnel working in AHTB. It is also important to enter into bilateral and multilateral agreements for effective investigation of trafficking and protection of victims,” it read.
The government has also been told to coordinate with the NHRC and AHTB for occupational health safety of Nepali migrant workers and direct the Nepali missions abroad to concentrate on rescue of trafficking victims. The report also shows poor implementation status of recommendations made by the NHRC in relation to human trafficking control, rescue and assistance of victims and their access to justice.
Human trafficking is not only a heinous crime, but also a vicious form of exploitation facing Nepali youths and children. The report said around 1.5 million population was at risk of trafficking in 2018-19 and nearly 35,000 of them ended up in various forms of trafficking. Cases of human trafficking are often trivialised by linking them to other aspects such as migration for employment. Human traffickers have been capitalising on lack of employment opportunity, low education level and poverty to lure the victims, it said. Key agents of trafficking comprise a range of individuals as well as agencies, including recruiting firms, education consultancies and marriage bureaus.

Only a few days after the Department of Transport Management started printing smart driving licences using high-capacity mass printer, the device has stopped functioning again, making it unlikely for service-seekers to get their smart licences any time soon.
In a bid to address the rising demand of smart driving licences and enhance DoTM’s capacity to print such cards, the department had purchased a mass printer with capacity to print almost 450 smart cards in an hour. The DoTM had just started printing smart driving cards through this printer on Wednesday. The DoTM was planning to issue smart driving licences to all pending service-seekers within a few months.
However, the DoTM’s plans and service-seekers’ hopes of getting smart driving permits soon have been dashed as the mass printer has abruptly stopped functioning.
“We have come across some technical glitches because of which the device has suddenly stopped functioning. However, the technical team is looking into the problem and trying to fix it,” said a DoTM official, seeking anonymity.
Due to inadequate printing capacity, the DoTM has not been able to issue smart driving licences to almost 800,000 service-seekers who had applied for renewal of old licences or had passed vehicle trial almost one year ago.
As the device is technically advanced, DoTM officials are finding it hard to repair the mass printer. Some high-level officials from the DoTM had recently visited Italy to learn about the printer’s functioning and its operational procedure. The same team is looking into technical glitches seen in the mass printer.
The DoTM had awarded Madras Printer the responsibility to print smart driving licences. The DoTM had spent Rs 49.7 million to purchase the mass printer.

The Supreme Court today granted leave to Shambhu Bharati to file a review petition against his conviction in Sudan scam.
Bharati, who was arrested by the police in August, is currently serving his jail sentence.
Bharati, an agent of Assured Risk Company, was found guilty of sending substandard consignments to the Nepal Police team deployed in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sudan.
The court had slapped Bharati with one-year imprisonment and a fine of Rs 142 million.
The scam involved embezzlement of money worth millions of rupees while procuring logistics for the Nepal Police personnel deployed in Darfur, Sudan. During procurement of the goods, Rs 284 million had been misappropriated.
The scam also led to surrender of former inspectors general of the Nepal Police including Shyam Singh Thapa, Om Bikram Rana, Hem Bahadur Gurung and Ramesh Chandra Thakuri,  who were sentenced to prison in 2017 by the Supreme Court for their involvement in embezzlement of the procurement fund.
In February 2012, the Special Court had convicted them of corruption along with the Armed Personnel Carrier suppliers.

Citizens were denied their fundamental rights to live in clean and healthy environment guaranteed by the constitution, but the government was not assessing its adverse impact on public health, said the National Human Rights Commission.
According to the annual human rights report released by the rights body last week, air pollution is making people susceptible to skin, eye and respiratory diseases, it has equally impacted cognitive and psychological well-being of the people, specially in Kathmandu valley. The NHRC warned that unmanaged construction of physical infrastructure had contributed to the highest portion of PM2.5 concentration in the air with 53 per cent, followed by vehicle emission (30 per cent), brick kilns (9 per cent), indoor smoke (5 per cent) and factories and open burning of refuse, one per cent each.
“Outdoor and indoor emission sources are major reasons behind deteriorating pollution level. Therefore, the government and concerned stakeholders need to be more sensitive towards tackling the pollution menace,” the report said, urging the authorities to implement the recommendations it made to the government from time to time in line with the Supreme Court order.
Earlier, the rights body had recommended that the government mitigate adverse impacts of environmental pollution in public health and promote cleanliness in valley to ensure that the citizen’s rights live in clean environment is not violated. Article 35 (4) of the constitution establishes each citizen’s right to safe drinking water and sanitation as fundamental rights. Article 30 (1) says each citizen shall have the right to live in clean and healthy environment and enjoy compensation for the harm caused by pollution.
According to the NHRC, unplanned digging of roads, poor implementation of development projects, unsafe disposal of hospital and industrial wastes, air pollution due to dust and smoke emitted by brick kilns, vehicular emission, irregular collection and disposal of household wastes, delay in blacktopping roads and haphazard dumping of construction materials, among others, were responsible for increasing environmental pollution in the valley.

The NHRC has recommended the government to develop a schedule comprising the date of commencement and completion of construction work before implementing development activities, and press concerned contractor to abide by pollution control measures as set forth in the laws.  It also asked the government to formulate a law which empowers the authorities concerned to impose on-the-spot fine on vehicles not meeting emission standards.
It has also urged the government to set up vehicular emission testing facilities at entry points of the valley and make the green sticker mandatory for vehicles in Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur. The NHRC has recommended the government to bring motorcycles and scooters under the provision of regular exhaust emission, besides increasing number of vehicular emission testing facilities.
The rights body reminded that it had directed the government to segregate wastes at their sources, rid the valley of visual pollution, determine time schedule for collection of waste in every area, control stray cattle, manage chemical wastes produced by hospitals and factories, enforce emission standards set for brick kilns, and make a provision of regular check-up of persons and children working in brick kilns. The NHRC had also recommended the government to formulate necessary law which required polluters to pay compensation to  pollution victim as per Article 30 (2) of the constitution.

Factional feud in the Nepali Congress reared its head again as the camp led by senior NC leader Ramchandra Paudel today boycotted the party’s Central Working Committee meeting amid differences over devising a calendar for the 14th National Convention of the party and proposal to increase the number of party divisions.
Leaders had assembled at the NC headquarters this morning to finalise the agenda for today’s CWC. However, bitterness started to creep in after NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba turned down Paudel’s proposal that the party devise a calendar for the national convention and include it in the agenda for discussion in the CWC. The Paudel camp is also against Deuba’s proposal to increase the number of party divisions to 41 from the existing 28.

As the meeting got under way, leaders including Paudel, Ram Sharan Mahat, Prakash Man Singh and Shekhar Koirala assembled in a different room at the party headquarters. General Secretary Shashank Koirala, who is also against Deuba’s proposal to increase number of party divisions, left for his residence before the meeting started.
The meeting was attended by leaders of the establishment faction, including Bimalendra Nidhi, General Secretary Purna Bahadur Khadka and Spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma.
The Paudel faction has charged the establishment faction of trying to delay the national convention by raising an unnecessary issue of revising the number of party divisions. The tenure of the existing CWC ends in mid-March.
Talking to THT, Paudel said Deuba was trying to throw the national convention into uncertainty. “What can we expect from a president who does not even want to include the issue of national convention in the agenda for the CWC meeting,” Paudel said. “Sensing the president is hell bent on throwing the party into crisis, we protested.”
Paudel said the president’s latest proposal to increase the number of party divisions to 41 was nothing but a ploy to delay the national convention. “The divisions have not been formed for the past four years. Now they are trying to increase the number of divisions a few months before the CWC’s tenure expires,” Paudel said. “We’ll never accept such things.”
NC CWC member Nabindra Raj Joshi, who is close to Paudel, said the establishment faction was trying to enforce their decisions on the basis of majority. “This is a wrong attitude,” he told THT.
On the other hand, the establishment faction argued that the statute had clearly provisioned that the CWC could revise the number of party divisions as per the need.
NC Spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma said the proposal to raise the number of party divisions was in line with the party statute provision and was based on the fact that the party had 42 divisions when late Sushil Koirala was the party’s president.
As far as the calendar for the 14th National Convention is concerned, Sharma said the previous CWC meet had decided to devise a calendar for the national convention only after the formation of subordinate committees of the party.
The party had delegated its election committee to form lower-level bodies. The committee is scheduled to brief the CWC about its progress in the ongoing CWC. “The calendar for the national convention cannot be devised without the issue being discussed in the CWC,” Sharma told THT.
Deuba had put forth nine agendas for today’s meeting, which endorsed three of them — all congratulatory proposals.
The next CWC meeting is scheduled for Sunday. It will discuss the remaining agendas, including progress made by the election committee in forming lower-level committees, review of the recently-held by-poll, increasing the number of party divisions and the Kalapani issue.

Speaking at the event, Mahat said the book deals with various ups and downs Nepal went through—regime changes, promulgation of new constitutions, 2015-earthquakes, armed insurgency and peace process. According to Mahat, the first chapter of the 12-chapter book deals with ideological underpinnings, specially socialist philosophy adopted by the Constitution. He has also talked about NC founder BP Koirala and his vision for socialism.
Other chapters of the book discuss Maoist insurgency followed by peace process and management of Maoist combatants, and issues affecting the final version of the constitution.
In the book, Mahat also discusses about Nepal’s foreign relation, specially geopolitics and how the concept of Nepal being a ‘yam between two boulders’ is changing.
According to Mahat, final chapters of the book dwell on economic issues. The book also dwells on Nepal’s hydropower potential, its present status, problems and prospects. Other economic issues discussed in the book are
remittance and its impact on the lives of people, and need for rapid economic growth by attracting foreign direct investment.
Mahat said the book also touches upon the issue of climate change and how Nepal has been affected by carbon emissions by two big fast industrialising countries—China and India. Mahat ends the book with challenges and tasks to be accomplished in the country’s march ahead.
The book has specially raised concerns about financial sustainability of local governments.

156,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/charity-sues-kenya-over-treatment-of-trafficked-indian-nepali-women/,"NAIROBI: A charity said on Monday it is suing the Kenyan government over a failure to provide five women trafficked from India and Nepal for sexual exploitation with appropriate care after they were rescued.
HAART Kenya said a decision to make the three Nepali and two Indian women rescued from a Nairobi bar in August stay and testify against their alleged traffickers had caused them psychological harm.
“After four months, the victims just want to go home. They have become deeply traumatised and suicidal … some have been hospitalised,” said Sophie Otiende, programme consultant for HAART Kenya, which has rented a safe house for the victims.
“So we have filed a complaint against the government so that all victims of trafficking are not compelled to testify, and the government pays for their speedy and safe repatriation.”
The government has said it hopes to repatriate the five women, aged in their early to mid-twenties, in the coming days.
The petition, due to be heard on Tuesday, states that Kenya’s attorney general, inspector general of police and director of public prosecutions violated an anti-trafficking law that says victims have a right to privacy and safe repatriation.
It also calls on authorities to pay expenses of more than 1.3 million Kenyan shillings ($12,830) incurred by the charity for the care of the victims, which the law says is the state’s responsibility.
Kenyan government officials denied a lack of care and said no request for funds had been received.
“We have received requests from other charities which are being considered. If HAART approached us, we would of course consider providing funds for these victims,” said Elizabeth Mbuka, Head of the Counter Trafficking in Persons Secretariat.
Mbuka said a court order for the repatriation of the five women had now been given.
BOLLYWOOD BARS
A rising number of women and girls are leaving South Asian nations such as Nepal, India and Pakistan to work in Bollywood-style dance bars in Kenya’s adult entertainment industry – many illegally – according to anti-trafficking activists and police.
There is no official data, but the results of police raids combined with figures on repatriation of rescued women suggest scores of women and underage girls are victims of organised human trafficking from South Asia to Kenya.
Common in India, so-called mujra dance bars – where young women dance to Bollywood music for money from male patrons – have mushroomed in cities including Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, where large numbers of Kenyans of South Asian descent live.
Police and anti-trafficking groups have repeatedly voiced concerns that some of these private clubs are used as a front to ensnare women and girls, some in sex slavery, with women forced to pay off loans by erotic dancing or having sex with clients.
An official from the Indian High Commission in Nairobi said there had been “a few” cases involving the trafficking of Indian women to Kenyan dance bars.
“Whenever there is a case, we request consular access and provide whatever support we can to the victims,” said the official, who did not want to be named.

TIRANA/THUMANE: At least 13 people were killed when the most powerful earthquake to hit Albania in decades shook the capital Tirana and the country’s west and north on Tuesday, tearing down buildings and burying residents under rubble.
Residents, some carrying babies, fled apartment buildings in Tirana and the western port of Durres after the 6.4 magnitude quake struck shortly before 4 a.m. (0300 GMT).
In the northern town of Thumane, Marjana Gjoka, 48, was sleeping in her apartment on the fourth floor of a five-storey building when the quake shattered the top floors.
“The roof collapsed on our head and I don’t know how we escaped. God helped us,” said Gjoka, whose three-year-old niece was among four people in the apartment when the quake struck.
The quake was centred 30 km (19 miles) west of Tirana, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said, and was also felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia.
Hours later a magnitude 5.4 earthquake hit Bosnia, with an epicentre 75 km (45 miles) south of Sarajevo, monitors said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
Five people were found dead in the rubble of apartment buildings in the northern Albanian town of Thumane and a man died in the town of Kurbin after jumping out of a building, a Defence Ministry spokeswoman said.
Seven bodies were pulled from collapsed buildings in Durres, the main port and tourism destination, the Defence Ministry said, adding 39 had been pulled out alive from under the ruins.
Defence Minister Olta Xhacka said 135 people were injured.
Firefighters, police and civilians were removing the debris from collapsed buildings in Thumane. Most of the buildings that collapsed were built of bricks, a Reuters reporter said.
Rescuers in Thumane used a mechanical digger to claw at collapsed masonry and remove a tangle of metal and cables. Others groped with bare hands to clear rubble.
Two people were pulled from rubble in Thumane four hours after the quake, a Reuters reporter said. Doctors said they were in a bad condition.
“Everything at home kept falling down,” Refik, a Tirana resident, said of the impact on his sixth-floor apartment.
“We were awake because of the previous quakes, but the last one shook us around,” he told Reuters, referring to smaller tremors recorded in the hour before the main quake.
Rescuers told local media one of the dead was an elderly woman who saved her grandson by cradling him with her body.
TRAPPED
Xhacka said the quake’s epicentre was in Durres. It was followed by 100 aftershocks.
“Durres and Thumane are the areas worst hit. Rescue-and-save work continues in the collapsed buildings there,” she said as troops pulled a victim from a hotel in Durres.
At least 135 people were injured, with 72 hospitalized, Xhacka said. Two planes from fellow NATO-member Romania were expected to land with specialized search and rescue equipment and help was coming from Italy and Turkey, Xhacka said.
Greece had sent emergency services for search and rescue operations, its premier’s office said.
“Firefighters and army staff are helping residents under the rubble”, in Durres and Thumane, the Defence Ministry said.
An unidentified man, with a wound dressing on his right cheek, told News24 TV his daughter and niece were among those trapped in a collapsed apartment building in Durres.
“I talked with my daughter and niece on the phone. They said they are well and are waiting for the rescue. Could not talk to my wife. There are other families, but I could not talk to them,” the man said.
Located along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, between Greece and Macedonia, Albania experiences regular seismic activity.
An earthquake of 5.6 magnitude shook the country on Sept. 21, damaging around 500 houses and destroying some. The Defence Ministry had said it was the most powerful quake in Albania in the last 30 years.
The images of collapsed buildings in urban areas suggested Tuesday’s quake was more powerful than one in 1979 which razed a neighbourhood of a northern town. Neither of those two earlier earthquakes caused fatalities.
The Balkan nation is the poorest country in Europe, with an average income of less than a third of the European Union average, according to Eurostat data.

SYDNEY: Firefighters battled hundreds of bushfires across Australia on Thursday as scores of blazes sprang up in new locations, triggering warnings that it was too late for some residents to evacuate.
As Thick smoke blanketed the most populous city of Sydney for a third day, residents were urged to keep children indoors, stepping up pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to tackle climate change.
By early afternoon, dozens of fires were burning across the southeastern state of Victoria and temperatures of 40.9 Celsius (105.6 F) in Melbourne, its capital, matched the hottest day on record in 1894, Australia‘s weather bureau said.
Authorities warned residents of towns about 50 km (31 miles) north of Ballarat, the state’s third largest city, that it was too late for them to evacuate safely.
“You are in danger, act now to protect yourself,” fire authorities said in an alert. “It is too late to leave. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately.”
Blazes across several states have endangered thousands of people, killing at least four people this month, burning about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroying more than 400 homes.
The early arrival and severity of the fires in the southern hemisphere spring follows three years of drought that experts have linked to climate change and which have left bushland tinder-dry.
With 10 days remaining to the official start of summer, extreme temperatures and high winds have sparked wildfires in new areas, even as firefighters tracked the crisis across the mainland, the Northern Territory and the island of Tasmania.
In Victoria, power to more than 100,000 homes was knocked out amid lightning strikes and strong, gusty winds of more than 110 kph (68 mph) that knocked tree branches into power lines, ahead of a cool change expected to bring relief in the evening.
The extensive damage was likely to leave some customers without power through the night as utilities worked to restore networks and fix downed powerlines, a spokeswoman for power provider Ausnet said.
State authorities issued its first Code Red alert in a decade, signifying the worst possible bushfire conditions, warning that should a fire start it would be fast moving, unpredictable and probably uncontrollable.
In the state of New South Wales, strong winds blew smoke from 60 fires still burning over much of Sydney, shrouding the harbour city and its famous landmarks in thick smog.
The state imposed tough new water curbs in Sydney from Dec. 10, when a key dam is expected to be down to 45% capacity. Residents face fines if they use hoses to water their gardens and wash their cars.
CLIMATE POLITICS
The unrelenting conditions have sharpened attention on the climate change policies of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who rejected any link.
“Climate change is a global phenomenon, and we’re doing our bit as part of the response to climate change,” Morrison told ABC radio.
“To suggest that, with just 1.3% of global emissions, that Australia doing something differently – more or less – would have changed the fire outcome this season, I don’t think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all.”
Morrison’s conservative government has committed to the Paris Agreement for a cut in emissions from 26% to 28% by 2030, versus 2005 levels. Critics say current projections suggest it will miss that target and have urged remedial steps.

159,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/singapore-court-to-hear-legal-challenges-on-gay-sex-ban/,"KUALA LUMPUR: As a Singapore court prepares to hear a series of legal challenges to a law that bans gay sex, LGBT+ activists on Tuesday called for the “right” verdict to be delivered so similar reforms can be triggered across other parts of Asia.
Like many other former British colonies, Singapore has retained an old law that criminalises gay sex, which was scrapped by India in a landmark court ruling last year to give a boost to LGBT+ rights.
Empowered by the Indian ruling, three Singaporean activists have launched separate bids in a renewed push to decriminalise gay sex in the city-state, where a high court is due to begin hearing their cases on Wednesday.
“I think public opinion is pretty clear across religious and age segments that homosexuality should not be a criminal offence,” Johnson Ong Ming, who was among the trio, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Ong, a DJ also known as DJ Big Kid, was the first to launch the case in September last year. The former head of a LGBT+ rights charity and a retired doctor also filed similar lawsuits later.
“I have full confidence in our judicial system and I am hopeful that the court will come to the right decision … and overturn Section 377A,” Ong said by email.
The court has set aside six days in November for the legal challenges to be heard but it is unclear when the proceedings will wrap up.
Under Section 377A of Singapore’s Penal Code, a man found to have committed an act of “gross indecency” with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare. The law does not apply to homosexual acts between women.
Singapore has emerged as a modern nation since independence six decades ago but socially it remains conservative, partly due to sensitivities stemming from multi-religious groups among its 5.6 million population.
Previous legal challenges to overturn the ban have failed, although recent opinion polls indicated there has been growing support for gay rights.
Opposition to gay marriage had fallen to 60%, down from 74% in 2013, according to a poll of more than 4,000 people published in May by the Institute of Policy Studies, a Singapore think-tank.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong however has previously said that Singapore society “is not that liberal on these matters”.
The Singapore court cases are being closely watched by LGBT+ groups in some other parts of Asia that have maintained the colonial-era law, including in Myanmar and Malaysia.
“If the decision in Singapore goes our way, then it will boost our morale here in Malaysia,” said Numan Afifi, president of the LGBT+ advocacy Pelangi Campaign in Malaysia.
Aung Myo Min, executive director from the Yangon-based Equality Myanmar LGBT+ campaign group said both Singapore and Myanmar “should follow the example of India” and repeal the archaic law.
Gay sex is a crime in both countries, with those convicted facing sentences of up to 10 years in jail in Myanmar and 20 years in Malaysia.

160,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/at-least-40-killed-as-fresh-protests-engulf-iraq-3/,"BAGHDAD: At least 40 protesters were killed in Iraq on Friday when security forces used tear gas and an Iranian-backed militia opened fire to try to quell renewed demonstrations against corruption and economic hardship, security sources said.

A government intelligence officer and a member of the powerful Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia were killed in a clash with protesters in the southern city of Amara, police sources said.
More than 2,000 people were injured nationwide, according to medical sources and the Iraqi High Commission on Human Rights (IHCHR), as demonstrators vented frustration at political elites they say have failed to improve their lives after years of conflict.
“All we want are four things: jobs, water, electricity, and safety. That’s all we want,” said 16-year-old Ali Mohammed who had covered his face with a T-shirt to avoid inhaling tear gas, as chaotic scenes overwhelmed Baghdad‘s central Tahrir Square.
Sirens wailed and tear gas canisters landed amid groups of young protesters draped in Iraqi flags and chanting “with life and blood we defend you Iraq.”
The bloodshed is the second major bout of violence this month. A series of clashes two weeks ago between protesters and security forces left 157 people dead and over 6,000 wounded.
The unrest has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which lived through foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State (IS) insurgency between 2003 and 2017. It is the biggest challenge to security since IS was declared beaten.
On Friday, eight protesters were killed in Baghdad, the IHCHR said. At least five of them were protesters struck by tear gas canisters, security sources said.
In the south, at least nine protesters were killed when members of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) militia opened fire on protesters who tried to set fire to the group’s office in the city of Nasiriya, according to security sources.
Eight people were killed in Amara city, including six protesters, one AAH member and one intelligence officer, police sources said. Three protesters were killed in oil-rich Basra, one in Hilla, and one in Samawa, security sources said.
In Diwaniya city, twelve protesters died after being trapped in a burning building, morgue officials and police sources said.
The building, which housed the local offices of the Iran-backed Badr Organisation, was apparently torched by protesters unaware that others were already inside.
Interior Ministry spokesman Khalid al-Muhanna said at least 68 members of the security forces were injured.
The sometimes violent demonstrations erupted in Baghdad on October 1 and spread to southern cities.
They pose the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi since he took office just a year ago. Despite promising reforms and ordering a broad cabinet reshuffle, he has so far struggled to address the protesters’ discontent.
POVERTY, DESPITE OIL WEALTH
Despite the OPEC member country’s vast oil wealth, many Iraqis live in poverty, have limited access to clean water, electricity, basic healthcare or decent education as the country tries to recover from years of conflict and economic hardship.
Many Iraqis view the elite as subservient to one or other of Iraq’s two main allies, the United States and Iran. Many suspect these powers use Iraq to pursue their struggle for regional influence via proxies unconcerned with ordinary people’s needs.
“They hit us last night and again this morning. We don’t have any demands anymore, we want the government toppled,” said demonstrator Salah Mohammad.
“We want Iran to take its parties and leave, America to take its parties and leave, and let the Iraqi people decide.”
In Basra, Reuters footage showed protesters clashing with security forces who launched tear gas canisters and stun grenades and were met by rocks thrown at their vehicles. Young men carried the injured away, as protesters set police cars on fire.
An 8 pm curfew was imposed until further notice in the southern provinces of Basra, Muthanna, Wasit, Babel and Dhi Qar, after protesters torched offices of lawmakers, Shi’ite political parties and militia headquarters.
How the government and security forces handled Friday’s planned protests had been seen as a litmus test for the stability of the country with political leaders already on edge.
RAGE AGAINST THE ELITE
In a Thursday night address, Abdul Mahdi stressed that violence would not be tolerated and warned that any collapse of the government would drag Iraq into further turmoil.
Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who in recent weeks criticised the government’s handling of the protests, urged calm on all sides during his sermon on Friday.
In Baghdad, many demonstrators initially believed authorities would refrain from violence after security forces killed dozens of protesters earlier this month.
Hundreds tried throughout the day to march into the city’s fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies, when they were stopped by security forces.
By afternoon, the mood had shifted with thousands of angry protesters wrapped in Iraqi flags under pouring rain, chanting that they were peaceful and calling political leaders corrupt.
As clashes broke out, tuk-tuks carried the injured to hospitals. Medical sources told Reuters hundreds of people had been treated for injuries, most related to tear gas exposure.

161,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/indian-muslims-anxious-as-court-prepares-to-rule-on-destroyed-mosque/,"
AYODHYA: In the Indian town of Ayodhya, minority Muslims are feeling under siege as they await a Supreme Court ruling on a centuries-old religious dispute that has cast a shadow over their relations with the majority Hindu community.
After a tangle of legal cases, the Supreme Court in August decided to hear arguments every day in an effort to resolve the dispute over what should be built on the ruins of the 16th-century Babri Masjid, destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992.
The uproar over the mosque triggered some of India‘s deadliest riots, in which nearly 2,000 people, most of them Muslim, were killed.
The bloody controversy raised lingering questions about the role of religion in the officially secular country, and the place of Muslims in it.
Last month, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi finished the hearings and is expected to pronounce his verdict in the next couple of weeks.
Whichever way it goes, the decision is likely to have a significant impact on the fraught relationship between India‘s Hindus and Muslims, who constitute 14% of its 1.3 billion people.
While most Muslim religious leaders want the mosque to be rebuilt, Hindus say there is evidence there was a temple on the site before the mosque was built in 1528 by a commander of Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty.
Construction of a “grand temple” in Ayodhya has long been an election promise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won a second term with a landslide this year.
Fearing tension after the court decision, Mohammed Shahid, 48, the grandson of the mosque’s last Imam, or prayer leader, has decided to move his family away.
He has reason to be afraid.
Shahid’s father, Mohammed Shabir, was killed by a mob of Hindus who rampaged through Ayodhya before tearing down the mosque on Dec. 6, 1992.
“In 1992, we decided to stay put – a decision that we live to regret,” Shahid said, sitting in the courtyard of his run-down, two-storied house.
“Other than killing my father, they set ablaze our house and a sawmill, our only source of income.”
‘BAD ELEMENTS’
Shahid said he was glad that his grandfather, who had died in 1990, did not see the destruction of the mosque.
Unlike Shahid, Haji Mahboob Ahmad, a 66-year-old Muslim community leader who lives near the site, doesn’t plan to leave.
But he shares Shahid’s anxiety.
“We’re conscious of the fact that some bad elements can try to foment trouble by taking advantage of the situation and that’s why I’ve requested authorities to ensure the safety of Ayodhya’s Muslims,” Ahmad said.
Ahmad said India‘s founding fathers established it as a secular democracy, and it must remain that.
The day Shahid’s father was killed, Hindu Hajari Lal, 57, escaped death.
Lal was among the hundreds of Hindus who destroyed the mosque with shovels, hammers and their bare hands, bringing down its domes before the whole structure collapsed.
Unfortunately for Lal, part of the building fell on him, trapping him in the rubble with broken bones.
“Since that fateful day of 1992, the only objective of my life is to see a permanent temple on the site. I can die in peace if I get to see the temple,” Lal said.
‘ENDLESSLY WAITING’
For Hindus, Lal said, the site in Ayodhya was as sacred as Mecca is in Islam.
That’s because Lal and millions of other Hindus believe the mosque was built at the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities.
Lal helps to guide a steady stream of pilgrims who come to see a model of what they hope will become a new temple.
Visitors can also look at an open field of masonry, in pink sandstone, including piles of ornately carved columns. Concrete pillars and blocks for foundations are also ready.
“Once the court green-lights construction of the temple, we can quickly move these concrete blocks from the workshop to the temple site,” said Sharad Sharma, spokesman for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council.
Top politicians, including some cabinet ministers, regularly visit Ayodhya to pay their respect to Nritya Gopal Das, an influential monk and chairman of a trust committed to building the temple.
“I’m sure Modi ji is aware of the sentiments of millions of Hindus who have been endlessly waiting to see the Ram temple,” said Das, using an honorific for Modi.

Canada named top country for social entrepreneurs
United States suffers biggest fall amid political uncertainty
More youth interest in working for businesses that do good



LONDON: Canada was named the best country for business leaders seeking to tackle social problems in a global poll on Tuesday while the United States fell from top slot due to political uncertainty.
Australia came second in the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s second global survey on the best countries for social entrepreneurs, seeing the biggest gain of 24 places from the inaugural poll in 2016, while France came third.
Mexico came last, down 15 places from 2016, but the United States was the biggest loser, plunging to 32nd place from No. 1, with the poll of about 900 social enterprise experts pointing to difficulties with government policy and access to investment.
Francois Bonnici, head of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, said over the past three years there had been “some amazing gains and some ongoing challenges” for social entrepreneurs addressing issues from climate change to refugees.
“Governments are recognising that to meet their own agendas this is a group of citizens and entrepreneurs that actually want to improve society and the environment,” said Bonnici.
“But it has a slightly different flavour in each country and that government role is important (as it) can legitimise the sector in their country by creating these policies.”
Business entrepreneurs globally are increasingly setting their sights on social problems with ventures that can be a commercial success while addressing problems like unemployment, homelessness, mental health, knife crime and even loneliness.
For example in South Africa social enterprise Harambee has created a ‘dating service’ to match unemployed youth with employers, while in India Project Patradya is tackling the waste problem by employing Afghan refugee women to make edible bowls.
But with little data on which nations were encouraging the sector, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in partnership with Deutsche Bank, began a poll in 2016 which was repeated in 2019. Social entrepreneurs, academics, investors and support agencies in the world’s 45 biggest economies, as ranked by the World Bank, were asked their views. Iran and Saudi Arabia were dropped in 2019 as it was impossible to get the right sample.
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
The 2019 poll found most experts, 82%, said social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum in their countries – although this was down three percentage points from 2016.
Canada, Indonesia and South Africa were named as the top countries where social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum, while Mexico, the United States and China saw the biggest falls.
Despite this, more than half of respondents – 54% – said the public still did not understand what they did which was not helped by the lack of a global definition of social enterprise. Italians were most aware of their work and Poles the least.
“People are becoming aware that the whole notion of social entrepreneurship is not just kumbaya,” said former Bangladeshi-U.S. investment banker Durreen Shahnaz, founder of the first social stock exchange, Impact Investment Exchange (IIX).
“It really is about doing serious work and making sure that work is scalable … There are signs the industry is maturing.”
The rising interest of young people – under the age of 25 – was a new finding, with three in four experts saying more young people were interested in working in social enterprises.
Indonesian social entrepreneur Denica Flesch wanted a career where she had a direct impact in the fight against poverty so in 2016, aged 26, she founded SukkhaCitta, an online marketplace selling clothes made by female artisans in Indonesian villages. “Young people are really challenging the notion of work, and combining purpose and career in one place,” said Flesch.
“They’re more idealistic and want to do something that’s beyond just looking for money.”
Canada was named as the top country where young people were playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs, followed by Germany and France, as well as the top place for women leaders.
WOMEN TAKING A LEAD
“Culturally we are about diversity and inclusion at a national level. That’s our brand, so that is helpful for the environment for social enterprise,” said Marcia Nozick, founder and chief executive of Vancouver-based social enterprise EMBERS.
She said policies that encouraged governments to buy the services of social impact ventures had been vital in helping the growth of EMBERS, which finds flexible jobs for people in a deprived part of Vancouver.
Nozick said there were many female leaders because it was “about caring and relationships and that has always been at the forefront of what women have brought to the business sector”.
Women were also seen as playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs in Australia, Belgium, Sweden and Malaysia.
The United States was named the worst place for female social entrepreneurs – the same as in 2016 – while Argentina and China slumped the most in questions regarding women in the poll conducted online and by telephone between May 7 and July 30.
The biggest falls for the United States overall related to access to investment, selling to businesses and supportive government policy.
Attracting investment continued to be a challenge, according to 56% of experts, down two percentage points from 2016.
Bonnie Chiu, founder and chief executive of Lensational, a social enterprise that trains marginalised women as photographers, said there was more capital available to social entrepreneurs but they had to jump through hoops to get it.
“So much time is spent chasing these opportunities,” said Chiu, whose business is based in Britain and Hong Kong.
“Traditional businesses just need to prove that they are financially sound, traditional charities just need to prove that they are generating social impact – but social enterprises need to do both.”
But regardless of the problems getting political support, financing or selling to businesses, experts said there would always be a need for social entrepreneurs to address the world’s largest problems where markets or public policy had failed.
“The more our political leaders might struggle to solve the world’s most pressing problems, the more opportunity for social entrepreneurs to come up with solutions,” said Jude O’Reilly, a senior director at U.S. nonprofit the Skoll Foundation.

OTTAWA: Canadians began voting on Monday to determine whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept into office four years ago as a charismatic figure promising “sunny ways,” will remain in power after two major scandals.
Polls opened in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland, with voting set to end in the Pacific Coast province of British Columbia at 7 p.m. (0200 GMT on Tuesday).
Trudeau, 47, the Liberal Party leader, was endorsed by former Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama in the final stretch of the campaign and is viewed as one of the last remaining progressive leaders among the world’s major democracies.
But he was shaken during the campaign by a blackface scandal and has been dogged by criticism of his handling of a corruption case involving a major Canadian construction company. Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has also had to overcome a sense of fatigue with his government.
Trudeau, accompanied by his wife and three children, voted in Montreal on Monday after a marathon sprint campaigning across the country in the past four days.
His Liberals and the main opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer are in a neck-and-neck race, according to opinion polls.
“The truth is it’s a coin toss right now,” said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker.
A year ago, no one would have predicted that Trudeau risked being the first prime minister since the 1930s to secure a parliamentary majority and then fail to win a second term.
The latest opinion polls suggest he may narrowly avert that result and could return to office with a minority in the 338-seat House of Commons. That would still leave Trudeau in a weakened position and needing the support of left-leaning opposition parties to push through key pieces of legislation.
The Canadian dollar was trading at a new three-month high on Monday, where “domestic attention is squarely on the 43rd federal election today,” said Shaun Osborne, chief market strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
“After some noise around the vote, we think FX players will refocus attention on the Bank of Canada policy outlook, the Fed and international backdrop pretty quickly,” he said.
Despite Scheer’s dimpled smile, Trudeau’s main rival has proven to be a determined opponent.
“He can’t even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he’s always wearing a mask,” Scheer said during a debate. “Mr. Trudeau, you are a phony and you are a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country.”
In his bid to unseat Trudeau, Scheer is also promising to balance the federal budget and eliminate a “carbon tax” on fossil fuels. Scheer, 40, is running his first campaign as party leader after winning a bitter Conservative leadership fight in 2017.
BUMPY CAMPAIGN RIDE
The six-week official campaign period has been a rough and meandering ride with dirty tactics on both sides.
The liberal image of Trudeau, who has championed diversity as prime minister and whose father opened up the country to mass immigration, took a severe blow when pictures emerged early in the campaign of him wearing blackface in the early 1990s and in 2001.
Trudeau had already been wrestling with the fallout from accusations he pressured his justice minister to help shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc from corruption charges. In August, a top watchdog said Trudeau breached ethics rules.
Given the fact that neither of the front-runners could come away with a parliamentary majority, it is the smaller left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) or the separatist Bloc Quebecois that could end up holding the balance of power.
“I am a lifelong Liberal voter and I am stumped on this one, mostly because I am really concerned about a Conservative win and just trying to figure out how to vote strategically,” said Kristin Street, 33, a strategy manager at a computer games company, in Port Moody, British Columbia.
EKOS Research pollster Frank Graves said Liberals needed turnout to be similar to four years ago or otherwise the Conservatives may have an edge.
“We may well be waiting until the final vote tallies in British Columbia to see who will win on Monday,” Graves said.

164,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/indonesia-says-over-11500-have-fled-violence-hit-papuan-town/,"
JAKARTA: Indonesian authorities said on Thursday more than 11,500 people have been evacuated from the town of Wamena in the easternmost province of Papua since dozens died during clashes last month in the area.
Located on the western half of the island of New Guinea and long racked by a simmering separatist insurgency, Papua encompasses Indonesia’s two easternmost provinces and has a distinct ethnic Melanesian population.
There has been a spike in protests and unrest since late August after Papuan students in Surabaya, Indonesia’s second city on the island of Java, were taunted and attacked by a mob chanting racial epithets over accusations they had desecrated a national flag.
In some of the worst bloodshed in decades in Papua, 33 people died and scores were hurt during clashes in Wamena on Sept. 23.
Government offices and homes were burned down, and 250 cars and motorcycles destroyed, as indigenous Papuans and security forces clashed.
The government and some Papuan independence activists say 25 of the 33 who died there were migrants from elsewhere in the country.
Erizal, 42, a former resident of Wamena who had left, said his child and wife died during the unrest and he now felt too traumatised to consider returning to the town.
“I am in my village in Padang now, maybe I will not return back to Wamena,” he said by telephone from the Padang area on Sumatra island where he was originally from.
He said his shop had also been burnt down in the unrest.
Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 2 Indonesia‘s air force had flown 7,467 people out of Wamena on Hercules planes, while 4,179 people had left on commercial flights, said Harry Hikmat, an official at Indonesia‘s social ministry.
Ahmad Musthofa Kamal, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said the situation in Wamane was now stable and that shops and markets were open again.
A former Dutch colony, Papua was formally incorporated into Indonesia in 1969, after a disputed vote of about 1,025 hand-picked tribal leaders. The result of the plebiscite was overseen and endorsed by the United Nations.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has opened the door to holding talks with separatists in Papua, a departure from the stance of previous governments and some of his cabinet ministers.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong police fired water cannon, rubber bullets and round after round of tear gas at petrol-bomb and brick-throwing protesters on Sunday in some of the most widespread violence in more than three months of anti-government unrest.
Running battles in the Causeway Bay shopping district, Wan Chai bar area and the Admiralty district of central government offices followed a night of showdowns with police in the Chinese-ruled city after a peaceful pro-democracy rally turned ugly on the streets outside.
More protests are planned in the run-up to China’s Oct. 1 National Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.
Police also fired tear gas from the roof of the Legislative Council building, which activists trashed and daubed with graffiti weeks ago.
Protesters, many of them wearing their trademark black with face masks, took cover from the tear gas behind umbrellas and held their ground on Sunday, some throwing tear gas canisters back at police as a helicopter flew overhead.
They built barricades with trolleys and trash cans and other debris. One threw a petrol bomb at police in the Wan Chai metro station.
At least one petrol bomb landed in the grounds of central government offices where several windows were smashed.
Police, who traditionally raise placards warning of retaliation before firing tear gas or firing water cannon, made several arrests, grappling people to the tarmac. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.
The water cannon fired blue dye, which elsewhere in the world is used to make identification of offenders easier.
The government said that the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, will be out of town for China’s National Day, despite her having sent out invitations for celebrations at home.
Some shops closed ahead of expected demonstrations, while the MTR metro service shut stations, a move that has made it a target of violence in the past.
Protesters shouted anti-China slogans and called for their “five demands, not one less” of the government, including universal suffrage and the dropping of all charges against their arrested colleagues.
About 200 China supporters dressed in red T-shirts gathered on top of Victoria Peak, overlooking the harbour, at around midday. They sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted “I love China”.
Angela, a housewife in her 40s, a Chinese flag sticker plastered on her cheek, said the pro-democracy protesters were “thugs”.
“If the government takes violent action I don’t object,” she said. “We have tolerated enough. I think I have emotional problems because of the riots. Because it’s not safe to go out.”
CHANGE OF HEART
Lam, the focus of weeks of anti-government unrest, will leave for Beijing on Monday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic the following day.
Lam, who was trapped in an indoor stadium by street protests for hours this week after an “open dialogue” with the people, will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night overland, minimising the chances of a clash at the airport, a popular target of anti-government protests.
She had sent out invitations “requesting the pleasure of your company” at a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Tuesday.
It was not immediately clear why she had the change of heart but the government said Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung would stand in for her.
Arthur, 40, wearing glasses and a mask covering the lower half of his face, said Lam’s trip was expected.
“In these three months, Carrie Lam has not really cared about the protesters. She only cares about the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) or what we might call ‘her boss’,” he said. “I think Hong Kong is somehow at this moment the frontline between Western democracy and the dictatorship in China…. Hong Kong looks more and more like a police state.”
Police fired tear gas and water cannon on Saturday night to disperse protesters who threw petrol bombs and rocks, broke government office windows and blocked a key road near the local headquarters of China’s People’s Liberation Army.
Anti-government protesters have attacked the legislature, Beijing’s main Liaison Office, occupied the airport, thrown petrol bombs at police, vandalised metro stations and set street fires in the former British colony.
Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds fired into the air.
The protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.
China dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.
Protests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement. Rallies in support of the anti-government protesters were held in Australia’s largest cities, with the biggest in Sydney.
Many wore face masks to hide their identity and crowds yelled “stand with Hong Kong” and “fight for freedom”, while placards depicted Chinese President Xi Jinping with a cross marked across his face.

NEW YORK: Earth is in more hot water than ever before, and so are we, an expert United Nations climate panel warned in a grim new report Wednesday.
Sea levels are rising at an ever-faster rate as ice and snow shrink, and oceans are getting more acidic and losing oxygen, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report issued as world leaders met at the United Nations.
The agency warned that if steps aren’t taken to reduce emissions and slow global warming, seas will rise 3 feet by the end of the century, with many fewer fish, less snow and ice, stronger and wetter hurricanes and other, nastier weather systems.
“The oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble, and that means we’re all in big trouble, too,” said one of the report’s lead authors, Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “The changes are accelerating.”
The dire effects will be felt on both land and sea, harming people, plants, animals, food, societies, infrastructure and the global economy. In fact, the international team of scientists projected for the first time that some island nations will probably become uninhabitable.
The oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat from carbon pollution in the air, as well as much of the carbon dioxide itself. Earth’s snow and ice, called the cryosphere, are also being eroded.
“The world’s oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe,” said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a deputy assistant administrator for research at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The report found:
Seas are now rising at one-seventh of an inch (3.66 millimeters) a year, which is 2.5 times faster than the rate from 1900 to 1990.
The world’s oceans have already lost 1% to 3% of the oxygen in their upper levels since 1970 and will lose more as warming continues.
From 2006 to 2015, the ice melting from Greenland, Antarctica and the world’s mountain glaciers has accelerated. They are now losing 720 billion tons (653 billion metric tons) of ice a year.
Arctic June snow cover has shrunk more than half since 1967, down nearly 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).
Arctic sea ice in September, the annual low point, is down almost 13% per decade since 1979. This year’s low, reported Monday, tied for the second-lowest on record.
Marine animals are likely to decrease 15%, and catches by fisheries in general are expected to decline 21% to 24%, by the end of century because of climate change.
“Climate change is already irreversible,” French climate scientist Valérie Masson-Delmotte, a report lead author, said at a news conference in Monaco, where the document was released. “Due to the heat uptake in the ocean, we can’t go back.”
But many of the worst-case projections in the report can still be avoided, depending on how the world handles the emissions of heat-trapping gases, the report’s authors said.
The IPCC increased its projected end-of-century sea level rise in the worst-case scenario by nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) from its 2013 projections because of the increased recent melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.
The new report projects that, under the business-as-usual scenario for carbon emissions, seas by the end of the century will rise between 2 feet (61 centimeters) and 43 inches (110 centimeters), with a most likely rise of 33 inches (84 centimeters). This is slightly less than the traditional 1 meter (39 inches) that scientists often use.
And sea level will rise two to three times as much over the centuries to come if warming continues, so the world is looking at a “future that certainly looks completely different than what we currently have,” said report co-author Hans-Otto Portner, a German climate scientist.
The Nobel Prize-winning IPCC requires that its reports be unanimously approved. Because of that, its reports tend to show less sea level rise and smaller harm than other scientific studies, outside experts said.
“Like many of the past reports, this one is conservative in the projections, especially in how much ice can be lost in Greenland and Antarctica,” said NASA oceanographer Josh Willis, who studies Greenland ice melt and wasn’t part of the report.
Willis said people should be prepared for a rise in sea levels to be twice these IPCC projections.
The world’s warm water coral reefs will go extinct in some places and be dramatically different in others, the report said.
“We are already seeing the demise of the warm water coral reefs,” Portner said. “That is one of the strongest warning signals that we have available.”
Outside scientists praised the work but were disturbed by it.
“It is alarming to read such a thorough cataloging of all of the serious changes in the planet that we’re driving,” said Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler. “What’s particularly disturbing as a scientist is that virtually all of these changes were predicted years or decades ago.”
The report’s authors emphasized that it doesn’t doom Earth to this gloomy future.
“We indicate we have a choice. Whether we go into a grim future depends on the decisions that are being made,” Portner said.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump welcomed Australia’s prime minister on Friday for only the second state visit of his administration, signaling the close bond between the two allies as Washington takes on Beijing and Tehran.
Trump and Scott Morrison are expected to discuss security and trade, as China’s increasing assertiveness, especially in the energy-rich South China Sea, has raised concerns within the region and the United States.
The leaders are also set to release a plan on Friday aimed at securing the supply of rare earth minerals, as concerns grow that China, the world’s largest processor and producer of the minerals, could cut off shipments of the prized commodities.
Days before the visit, a sign draped across the Australian Embassy in Washington proclaimed “100 years of mateship” between the two countries. On Friday, Trump feted Morrison’s arrival at the White House’s South Lawn with a 19-gun salute and US Marine Band performances of each nation’s national anthems.
“It’s highly symbolic of where the relationship sits at the moment,” said Patrick Buchan, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting that Morrison’s state visit was second only to French President Emmanuel Macron’s last year.
“Australia played a very smart game with Trump,” he added, noting the country had avoiding directly criticizing him, unlike some European counterparts.
Trump got off to a smooth start with Morrison in May, congratulating him on his surprise election victory in a tweet noting there were “no greater friends” than the United States and Australia.
The two also met on the sidelines of the G20 in June, cementing warm ties that Trump did not enjoy with Morrison’s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. Trump berated Turnbull in February 2017 over a bilateral refugee agreement before abruptly ending their telephone conversation.
Australia also agreed last month to join a coalition to protect oil tankers and cargo ships from threats posed by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz after a series of attacks there that Washington has blamed on Tehran.
Australia has also banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , the world’s top provider of telecoms equipment, from its 5G network, something the Trump administration has struggled to persuade other allies to do. The United States says Huawei’s ties to Beijing make the network equipment it sells to telecoms firms a security risk.
Australian intelligence concluded China was responsible for a cyberattack on Australia’s parliament and its three largest political parties, Reuters reported on Monday.
Following an arrival ceremony, bilateral meetings, and a joint news conference, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will host a luncheon for Morrison to be followed by a state dinner at the White House.
SECURITY AND TRADE
During a visit to Sydney last month by Pompeo and US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the United States and Australia pledged to strengthen opposition to Chinese activities in the Pacific.
China has unnerved the region and angered the United States by installing military equipment and other facilities on artificial islands it has made in the disputed South China Sea.
The United States and its Western allies also worry that China is using foreign aid to secure greater influence over small Pacific countries that control vast swath of resource-rich ocean.
Australia, traditionally the major power in the South Pacific, has promised up to A$3 billion ($2 billion) in grants and loans to counter what Washington describes as China’s “payday loan diplomacy.”
But Morrison has pressed Trump to end his trade war with China, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.

BEIJING: China expressed anger on Tuesday after German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas met prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, saying that no foreign country had a right to interfere in China’s internal affairs.
Wong met Maas on Monday in Berlin at an event hosted by the German newspaper BILD.
After being held for around 24 hours at the Hong Kong airport on Sunday for allegedly breaching the terms of his bail, Wong arrived in Berlin late on Monday evening, where he said he would “continue his battle for free elections”.
The timing is especially awkward as German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Beijing last week. Hong Kong has been gripped by weeks of protests, initially against a now-shelved extradition bill and now focused more on securing greater freedoms for Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China was “extremely dissatisfied and resolutely opposed” to German allowing Wong to visit and to allow him to meet the German foreign minister.
“China has already lodged stern representations with the German side,” Hua told a daily news briefing.
Hong Kong is an internal affair and no foreign government, organisation or individual has a right to interfere, she added.
“Any plots to rely on foreigners to build oneself up or acts or words to split the country are doomed to failure.”
Hua said that during her trip last week, Merkel clearly said that she opposes violence and supports “one country, two systems”.
Hong Kong returned to Beijing from British rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
“We can’t help but ask, what is the purpose of the German side in allowing Joshua Wong to come to Germany at this time and to meet with minister Maas?”
China urges Germany to abide by its promises and avoid sending wrong messages to separatist Hong Kong forces, and urges Maas to abide by the basics of international law and act for the benefit of relations and not be a “damager” of the relationship, Hua added.
Interference by foreign parliaments in Hong Kong‘s matters is deeply regrettable, the leader of the Chinese-ruled city said earlier on Tuesday, adding that an escalation of violence cannot solve social issues in the city.
Carrie Lam was speaking after another weekend of sometimes violent clashes in the former British colony, with police firing tear gas to disperse protesters in cat-and-mouse skirmishes, at times smashing windows and starting street fires.
Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding the autonomy they had been promised. China denies accusations of meddling in the city.

SRINAGAR: India on Sunday imposed curfews in several parts of the contested Kashmir region, after clashes between security forces and Shi’ite Muslims taking part in a procession, officials and eyewitnesses said.
At least 12 locals and six troops were injured on Saturday evening, officials told Reuters, as the worshippers on the traditional mourning procession of Muharram clashed with troops trying to stop it.
Troops used tear gas and pellet guns on the crowd, which insisted on carrying on with the procession, one in a series held at this time of the year, and pelted stones at security forces, an Indian official who declined to named told Reuters.
“The clashes continued till late night during which the troops fired tear gas and pellets,” he added.
A spokeswoman for India‘s interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
“Reasonable restrictions are necessary for peace and protection of life,” India‘s national security adviser had said on Saturday, accusing Islamabad of trying to stoke violence in the region.
Kashmir, a mountainous Muslim-majority region claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been the site of frequent altercations between security forces and locals protesting against New Delhi’s decision to revoke special rights for the portion of the territory that it controls on Aug. 5.
The most recent clashes occurred in Rainawari and Badgam, two Shi’ite majority areas of Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir’s main city.
The five km (3 mile) procession route that passes through the city centre has been barricaded by armed troops wearing helmets and bullet proof vests.
On Sunday, police vans fitted with loud speakers announced curfew-like restrictions in Srinagar’s city center Lal Chowk and adjacent areas, according to two Reuters witnesses.
“People are advised to stay indoors and not venture out of their home,” the police announced.
Suhail Ahmed, a Rainawari resident, said that there have been frequent clashes in the area for last three to four days as troops have been trying to block the procession.
“We hear deafening sounds of tear gas being fired for last few evenings. We mostly stay indoors but the gas comes into our homes making it difficult to sleep,” Ahmed said.
Muharram is the first month of the year according to the Muslim lunar calendar, and traditionally processions are held for the first 10 days of the month to observe the death of Prophet Muhammad’s nephew Imam Hussein, killed in battle in 680.
Shi’ite Muslims typically intensify their expression of suffering on the Ashura day, that this year falls on Tuesday.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests so the Chinese-ruled city can move forward from a “highly vulnerable and dangerous” place and find solutions.
Her televised announcement came after Reuters reports on Friday and Monday revealing that Beijing had thwarted an earlier proposal from Lam to withdraw the bill and that she had said privately that she would resign if she could, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters.
“Lingering violence is damaging the very foundations of our society, especially the rule of law,” a sombre Lam said as she sat wearing a navy blue jacket and pink shirt with her hands folded on a desk in front of her.
The withdrawal, a key demand of protesters but just one of five, came after unrest that drove the former British colony to the edge of anarchy as the government repeatedly refused to back down – igniting pitched battles across the city of seven million, the arrests of more than 1,000 protesters, and leaving a society deeply divided.
Many are furious about perceived police brutality and the number of arrests – 1,183 at the latest count – and want an independent inquiry.
“The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,” Lam said.
“I pledge that the government will seriously follow up the recommendations of the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Council) report. From this month, I and my principal officials will reach out to the community to start a direct dialogue … we must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions.”
The protests began in March but snowballed in June and have since evolved into a push for greater democracy for the city which returned to China in 1997.
The bill would have allowed extraditions to mainland China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
It was not immediately clear if killing the bill would help end the unrest. The immediate reaction appeared sceptical and the real test will be how many people take to the streets.
Some lawmakers said the move should have come earlier.
“The damage has been done. The scars and wounds are still bleeding,” said pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo. “She thinks she can use a garden hose to put out a hill fire. That’s not going to be acceptable.”
WINNING OVER MODERATES?
In the voice recording obtained by Reuters, Lam said at a meeting last week that her room to find a political solution to the crisis was “very limited”, as authorities in Beijing now viewed the situation as a matter of national security.
Beijing’s apparent endorsement of the withdrawal of the bill comes after the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rule since he took power in 2012.
Others said the move was not enough.
“This won’t appease the protesters,” said Boris Chen, 37, who works in financial services. “In any kind of time, people will find something they can get angry about.”
Pro-Beijing lawmaker Cheung Kwok-kwan said Lam’s announcement was not a compromise to appease those promoting violence, but a bid to win over moderates in the protest camp.
“It was likely speaking to the so-called peaceful, rational, non-violent people who were unsatisfied with the government’s response before,” he said.
One woman, Pearl, 69, said the protests were no longer about the bill.
“Some of those guys may change their minds, maybe, but just a minority,” she said of the protesters. “Some of them just want to create trouble and they will continue to do so.”
“Too little, too late,” said Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014 pro-democracy protests which were the precursor to the current unrest, on his Facebook page.
Leung Yiu-ting, president of the Hong Kong Education University student union, said the timing was wrong.
“Until the five demands are met, I don’t think the protests and the social movement will stop,” he said.
The protesters’ other four demands are: the retraction of the word “riot” to describe rallies, the release of all arrested demonstrators, an independent inquiry into the police perceived brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to democratically choose their own leaders.
The chief executive’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill’s withdrawal.
Hong Kong‘s benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped after the report of the bill’s imminent withdrawal, trading up about 4%. The property index also jumped.
Lam had said before that the bill was “dead”, but she did not withdraw it.
CHINA’S WARNINGS
Hong Kong returned to China under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system, hence the anger at the extradition bill and perceived creeping influence by Beijing.
China denies it is meddling in Hong Kong‘s affairs but warned again on Tuesday that it would not sit idly by if the unrest threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.
China has regularly denounced the protests and warned about the impact on Hong Kong‘s economy.
Cathay Pacific Airways has been one of the biggest corporate casualties.
China’s aviation regulator demanded it suspend staff from flying over its airspace if they were involved in, or supported, the demonstrations. The airline has laid off at least 20 including pilots and cabin crew.
The airline on Wednesday announced the resignation of chairman John Slosar, following the departure of CEO Rupert Hogg last month.
The unrest has shown no sign of easing.
Riot police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray – both anti-riot weapons – to clear demonstrators from outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station, with one man taken out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, television footage showed.
The police, who have repeatedly denied using excessive force, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HONG KONG: Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw global attention to their fight for greater democracy for the Chinese-ruled city which is facing its biggest political crisis in decades.
Planes were taking off and landing, with delays, but trains were suspended and approach roads to the airport impassable as protesters erected barricades and overturned trolleys at the airport and in the nearby new town of Tung Chung.
Some passengers were forced to walk the last bit of their journey to the airport by foot, dragging their luggage behind them.
The MTR subway station in Tung Chung was closed and demonstrators smashed CCTV cameras and lamps with metal poles and dismantled station turnstiles. Police appeared to be running in all directions and made several arrests.
Chek Lap Kok, built around a tiny outlying island in the dying days of British colonial rule, is one of the world’s busiest and most efficient airports, reached by a series of bridges which were packed with traffic.
“If we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong,” said one 20-year-old protester, asking not to be named.
Black-clad demonstrators targeted the airport three weeks ago, jamming the terminal in sometimes violent clashes with police and prompting some flights to be cancelled or delayed.
Police said protesters hurled iron poles, bricks and rocks on to the railway track near the airport station and trespassed on the track. By early evening protesters in the immediate vicinity of the airport had left, but protesters in Tung Chung remained.
“We have no idea how to leave. We’re stuck,” a masked protester said, as others looked for buses and ferries to get back home.
Sunday’s demonstration comes after police and protesters clashed overnight in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to the territory when it was handed back to China in 1997.
China denies the charge of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.
Tourist numbers have plummeted in recent weeks and international trade fairs cancelled as the territory faces its first recession in a decade.
China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.
Several hundred demonstrators also gathered outside the British consulate in central Hong Kong, waving Union Jack flags and chanting “God save the Queen”.
SUBWAY VIOLENCE
Parts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway on Saturday, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas. Police said they arrested 63 people aged between 13 and 36.
Amnesty International said the metro violence should be investigated.
“Violence directed at police on Saturday is no excuse for officers to go on the rampage elsewhere,” it said.
The latest protests came on the fifth anniversary of China’s decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong.
The unrest began in mid-June, fuelled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.
But the turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy.
The unrest poses the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.
Protesters have called for a general strike on Monday, but it was not immediately clear who would take part.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of efforts to restore calm and that talks with non-violent protesters would provide “a way out” for the Chinese-ruled city.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied peacefully in torrential rain on Sunday in the eleventh week of what have been often violent demonstrations.
“I sincerely hope that this was the beginning of society returning to peace and staying away from violence,” Lam said.
“We will immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue. This dialogue, I hope, will be based on a mutual understanding and respect and find a way out for today’s Hong Kong.”
Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China for trial.
The unrest has been fuelled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula put in place after Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.
Three people were wounded, one critically, in a knife attack by an unknown assailant near a “Lennon Wall” of colourful pro-protest messages in the city’s Tseung Kwan O district in the New Territories overnight, police said. One man was arrested.
The protests have prompted sharp reactions from Beijing, which has accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest in the territory. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighbouring Shenzhen.
Britain’s Foreign Office said it was extremely concerned about reports that a Hong Kong staff member had been detained in mainland China, but there was no immediate suggestion that there was any link to the protests.
Staff member Simon Cheng did not return to work on Aug. 9 after visiting the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen the previous day, Hong Kong news website HK01 reported. China’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment. Hong Kong police did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc also said on Monday they had dismantled a state-backed social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on the Twitter and Facebook actions, but defended the right of Chinese people to make their voices heard.
Further demonstrations are planned in the next few days, including by MTR subway workers on Wednesday, secondary school students on Thursday and accountants on Friday.
The protests are exacting a toll on the city’s economy and tourism, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.
Singapore universities have cancelled exchange programmes to Hong Kong after Singapore warned its citizens to defer travel there, news website Today reported.
Singapore’s foreign ministry said in an advisory last week large protests in Hong Kong had become unpredictable and could turn violent with little or no notice.
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS
Sunday’s protest turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and protesters could be seen on Sunday night urging others to go home peacefully.
Aside from seeking Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
“The bill is dead,” Lam told Tuesday’s news briefing. “There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns.”
Police have been criticised for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
Lam said the police watchdog had set up a task force to investigate complaints.
She said she hoped Hong Kong had “unique advantages in attracting overseas companies”, stressing the rule of law, but warned of the risk of pressure on the economy which shrank 0.4% in April-June from the previous quarter.
“The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half. Actually, I think the data in the first half has not fully reflected the seriousness of the problem,” she said.
China has put strong pressure on big companies in Hong Kong over the protests, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s departure was announced by Chinese state television and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in protests.
China’s State Council called on Monday for greater development of the southern city of Shenzhen and integration of its culture and economy with neighbouring Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong is gearing up for further protests this week after hundreds of thousands of anti-government demonstrators braved heavy rain to rally peacefully on Sunday, marking a change to what have often been violent clashes.
Sunday’s massive turnout, which organisers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the Chinese-ruled city’s airport.
Some activists had apologised for the airport turmoil and on Sunday night protesters could be seen urging others to go home peacefully.
Police said on Monday that while Sunday’s demonstration was mostly peaceful, there were breaches of the peace in the evening when some protesters defaced public buildings and aimed laser beams at officers.
It was a far cry from the violent clashes between protesters and riot police throughout the summer, with activists storming the legislature and targeting China’s main Liaison Office in the city. The weekend was also noteworthy for a lack of tear gas use by police.
The protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. They have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China, including an independent judiciary, but many in the city believe Beijing has been eroding those freedoms.
Aside from Lam’s resignation, demonstrators have five demands – complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
One protester, speaking at a “citizen’s press conference” on Monday, was asked what path the protests would take now, peaceful or violent.
“We have started our rallies very peacefully but after two and a half months it seems that the Hong Kong government has not responded to our five demands so one thing leads to another and it may cause escalation,” the speaker, named Wang, said.
“If you ask me, I personally hope there will be a quick resolution to this from the government so we don’t have to protest any more.”
On Sunday, protesters spilling out from Victoria Park, the designated rally area on Hong Kong island, streamed onto major thoroughfares towards the city’s financial centre, chanting for Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam to step down.
Police estimated the size of the crowd in Victoria Park at 128,000 at its peak, although that excludes the masses of umbrella-carrying demonstrators who packed the streets.
CHINESE FORCES ACROSS THE BORDER
The Hong Kong government said in a statement on Sunday night it was important to restore social order as soon as possible and that it would begin talks with the public and “rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down”.
The Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, attributed the change in the character of Sunday’s protest to the presence of Chinese paramilitary forces, which have been conducting exercises in Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong.
“This was widely seen as a stern warning to the violent elements in Hong Kong,” it said, adding that a backlash from Hong Kong residents over last week’s airport occupations was another factor.
The Chinese Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper warned again in an editorial on Monday that hostile foreign influences were inciting the protest movement. Beijing has accused some countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest.
US President Donald Trump hinted on Sunday that the White House would like to see Beijing resolve the protests before the world’s two largest economies could reach a trade deal.
“I would like to see Hong Kong worked out in a very humanitarian fashion,” Trump said. “I think it would be very good for the trade deal.”
Further demonstrations are planned in coming weeks, including protests planned by Christians and even an accountants’ group.
Police have come under criticism for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations, but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.
The central government has sought to deepen integration between the mainland and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and nearby Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave which returned to China in 1999. The State Council called on Monday for greater development of the so-called Greater Bay Area and to enrich the “one country, two systems” policy.
China has also put strong pressure on big companies, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.
Hogg’s sudden departure was announced by Chinese state television on Friday and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.
Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in the protests.
Shares in Cathay rose more than 2% early on Monday before paring gains to be down 0.6%. Jeffries analysts wrote in a note on Monday that it maintained its “buy” rating on Cathay and that it expected the company to remain profitable.

KATHMANDU: Nepal must make training and experience in high altitude climbing mandatory for all climbers on Mount Everest and other high peaks, a government panel said on Wednesday, following the deadliest climbing season in four years.
Eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the 8,850 metre (29,035 feet) mountain in May – nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side.
The Nepali panel – made up of government officials, climbing experts and agencies representing the climbing community – was set up after climbers and guides criticised officials after the deaths for allowing anyone who paid $11,000 to climb Everest.
Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Everest, and mountain climbing is a key source of employment and income for the cash strapped nation.
But the numbers attempting the climb in May led to crowding in the so-called death zone, where there are very low oxygen levels. That put lives at risk as oxygen cylinders ran out while up to 100 people waited in the queue.
Nepal issued 381 permits for Everest for this year’s climbing season, which tends to culimate in May, when the daylight and weather is the most forgiving.
“Climbers to Sagarmatha and other 8,000 metre mountains must undergo basic and high altitude climbing training,” the panel said in a report submitted to the government, referring to the Nepali name of Mount Everest.
The report said those hoping to climb Everest must climb at least one Nepali peak above 6,500 metres before getting a permit. Climbers must also submit a certificate of good health and physical fitness, and be accompanied by a trained Nepali guide, it said.
Ghanshyam Upadhyaya, a senior Tourism Ministry official, said the recommendations would be implemented.
“The government will now make the required changes in laws and regulations guiding mountain climbing,” he told Reuters.
Mira Acharya, a member of the panel said “climbers died due to altitude sickness, heart attack, exhaustion or weaknesses and not due to traffic jams”.
She said the compulsory provision of guides for each climber was to discourage solo attempts which put lives at risk.
A reliable weather forecasting system should be in place and rope fixing should be done in time, giving enough space for the climbers to use a window of good weather to reach the summit, the report said.

HONG KONG: Flights leaving Hong Kong were disrupted for a second day on Tuesday, plunging the former British colony deeper into turmoil as its stockmarket fell to a seven-month low, and its leader said it had been pushed into a state of “panic and chaos”.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also urged Hong Kong to exercise restraint and investigate evidence of its forces firing tear gas at protesters in ways banned under international law.
Ten weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and protesters have roiled the Asian financial hub as thousands of residents chafe at a perceived erosion of freedoms and autonomy under Chinese rule.
China this week condemned some protesters for using dangerous tools to attack police, calling the clashes “sprouts of terrorism”. They present President Xi Jinping with one of his biggest challenges since he came to power in 2012.
Hong Kong legal experts say Beijing might be paving the way to use anti-terror laws to try to quell the demonstrations.
Check-in operations were suspended at 4.30 pm on Tuesday, a day after an unprecedented airport shutdown, as thousands of black-clad protesters jammed the terminal, chanting, singing and waving banners.
“Take a minute to look at our city, our home,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said, her voice cracking, at a news conference in the government headquarters complex, which is fortified behind 6-foot (1.8-m) -high water-filled barricades.
“Can we bear to push it into the abyss and see it smashed to pieces?”
The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed suspects’ extradition to mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy.
At the airport, thousands of protesters gathered in the arrivals hall, as well as some parts of departures, using luggage trolleys to blockade the doors to customs checkpoints.
Floors and walls were covered with missives penned by activists and other artwork. The scene was peaceful as knots of protesters spoke to travellers, explaining their aims.
“Sorry for the inconvenience, we are fighting for the future of our home,” read one protest banner at the airport.
“I think paralysing the airport will be effective in forcing Carrie Lam to respond to us … it can further pressure Hong Kong’s economy,” said Dorothy Cheng, 17.
Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997.
They want Lam to resign. She says she will stay.
“My responsibility goes beyond this particular range of protest,” she said, adding that violence had pushed the territory into a state of “panic and chaos”.
As she spoke, the benchmark Hang Seng index hit a seven-month low. It shed more than 2%, dragging down markets across Asia.
Lam did not respond to questions at a press briefing to clarify if she had the power to withdraw the extradition bill and satisfy a key demand made by the protesters, or if she needed Beijing’s approval.
AIRPORT DISRUPTED
Airport authorities had earlier suspended check-in operations as the fifth day of a sit-in by protesters grew increasingly heated. Crowds continued to swell in the evening.
“Terminal operations at Hong Kong International Airport have been seriously disrupted as a result of the public assembly,” the airport authority said.
Some passengers challenged protesters over the delays as tempers began to fray, while the demonstrators, using a Chinese term of encouragement, chanted, “Hong Kong people – add oil!”
Flag carrier Cathay Pacific warned: “There is potential for further flight disruptions at short notice.”
The airline, whose British heritage makes it a symbol of Hong Kong’s colonial past, is also in a political bind.
China’s civil aviation regulator demanded that the airline suspend staff who joined or backed the protests from flights in its airspace, pushing the carrier’s shares past Monday’s 10-year low.
Other Chinese airlines have offered passengers wanting to avoid Hong Kong a free switch to nearby destinations, such as Guangzhou, Macau, Shenzhen or Zhuhai, with the disruption sending shares in Shenzhen Airport Co Ltd surging.
On Monday China said the protests had reached a critical juncture, after a weekend of street clashes in which both police and protesters appeared to toughen their resolve.
Police fired tear gas at the blackshirted crowds in districts on Hong Kong island, Kowloon and the New Territories.

HONG KONG/BEIJING: China’s aviation regulator on Friday demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend personnel who have engaged in illegal protests in the city from staffing flights into its airspace from August 10.
Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Last week, a Cathay pilot was among over 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing’s main representative office in the city.
On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said that Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website.
The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights.
Crew members that have not gained the authority’s approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations.
The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.
In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: “We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly.”
“The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific. There is zero tolerance for any inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour that may affect aviation safety. We deal with these incidents very seriously.”
Cathay said on Thursday it respects “everyone’s right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner,” while insisting it “recognises that Hong Kong SAR is a part of China”.
“We do not condone any activities that jeopardise the stability of Hong Kong,” it said.
On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights.
Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respects its staff’s opinions.
“We certainly wouldn’t dream of telling them what they have to think about something. They’re all adults, they’re all service professionals. We respect them greatly,” he said.
Global Times, published by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, ran news stories this week highlighting Cathay employees’ participation in the ongoing protests.
Embattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam on Friday urged an end to the violence, claiming that the protests are dragging on the city’s economy.
Hong Kong-listed Cathay is 45% owned by Swire Pacific and 22.7% held by Air China , according to Refinitiv Eikon.
The airline has been Hong Kong’s flag carrier since the colonial era. Swire Pacific’s parent, John Swire & Sons Ltd, is a UK-based conglomerate with businesses ranging from property to transportation.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Wednesday it would expel India’s ambassador and suspend bilateral trade with its arch-rival after New Delhi stripped its portion of the contested Kashmir region of special status.
Neighbours China and Pakistan, which both claim parts of the region, have voiced fierce opposition to India’s move dropping a constitutional provision that had allowed the country’s only Muslim-majority state to make its own laws.
Moin-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s newly-appointed ambassador to India, had yet to take up his post but will now not move to New Delhi, while Indian Ambassador Ajay Bisaria will be expelled, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a telephone interview with Pakistani TV channel ARY News.
“It is very obvious that our ambassador wouldn’t be in Delhi, and obviously the man who is here will also leave,” Qureshi said.
Earlier Pakistan’s National Security Committee, a panel of top government and military officials chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, said it would implement a range of measures over what it called India’s “illegal” decision to revoke Kashmir’s special status.
That includes “downgrading of diplomatic relations with India” and a further review of bilateral arrangements between the two countries, a committee statement said, without elaborating further.
Qureshi told Pakistan’s parliament on Wednesday the country was consulting with China regarding Kashmir and that he might fly to Beijing for discussions with officials there.
A spokesman for India’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ISLAMABAD/MUZAFFARABAD: Pakistan said on Tuesday it was considering further diplomatic and military pressure on India after the Hindu-majority nation stripped its portion of contested Kashmir of special status.
India on Monday dropped a constitutional provision for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which has long been a flashpoint in ties with neighbouring Pakistan, to make its own laws.
Nuclear arch-rivals India and Pakistan both claim Muslim-majority Kashmir in full but rule it in part. They have fought two wars over the territory and came close to a third this year after a car bomb set off by a Pakistan-based militant group killed dozens of Indian paramilitary police.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday India’s removal of special status for Kashmir, which included prohibiting outsiders from owning property, was an attempt to alter the demographics of the region and was illegal under international law.
“We will fight it at every forum. We’re thinking how we can take it to International Court (of Justice)… to the United Nations Security Council,” Khan said in an address to Pakistan’s parliament.
Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, accusing India of violating Security Council resolutions on Kashmir.
Qureshi is returning early from the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as a result of the crisis, the foreign ministry said.
India maintains its actions in Kashmir are legal both under domestic and international law.
Earlier on Tuesday, Pakistan’s army chief said the country’s military will “go to any extent” to support people in the region.
“Pakistan Army firmly stands by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end,” said General Qamar Javed Bajwa after meeting with top commanders in Rawalpindi.
“We are prepared and shall go to any extent to fulfil our obligations in this regard,” he added, without elaborating further.
BUSINESS SHUTDOWN
In Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir around 45km (28 miles) from the contested border between the neighbours, protests continued for a second day with hundreds of people including children shouting anti-India slogans.
In the Neelum Valley, which sits on the border and has seen heavy shelling between the two countries in recent weeks, there was a shutdown of shops and businesses in protest at India’s decision.
Many people in Kashmir have relatives on both sides of the border, but people on the Pakistani side say they have been unable to contact those in India for several days after New Delhi restricted internet and phone access.
Tanveer-ul-Islam migrated from India to Muzaffarabad in 1990. His family, including his elderly mother and siblings, live in the Badgam district of Indian Kashmir, but he said he has been unable to contact them for two days.
“My day does not begin until I speak to my mother, but I have not been able to talk to her (since) Aug 4. You can’t even imagine my pain,” he said. “We do not know about the well being of anyone across the divide”.
His wife Haleema Akhtar, whose family is in Magam in Indian-administered Kashmir, said she was also unable to contact them.
“I called my daughter and son-in-law in the US to try to contact them, but they too expressed helplessness in the face of the clampdown on communication,” she said.

HONG KONG: Police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong on Sunday after violent clashes a day earlier, and Beijing said it would not let the situation persist.
The Chinese-controlled city has been rocked by months of protests against a proposed bill to allow people to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China and they have now grown into calls for greater democracy.
A general strike aimed at bringing the city, an Asian financial hub, to a halt is planned for Monday.
After the peaceful demonstrations finished, hundreds of masked protesters blocked roads in the town of Tseung Kwan O in the New Territories, set up barricades and hurled hard objects, including bricks at a police station.
Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters after a separate rally in the island’s Western district where thousands of people gathered to urge authorities to listen to public demands.
Protesters had began a march towards China’s Liaison Office which has been a flashpoint at previous protests.
Police said the protesters were “participating in an unathorised assembly”, similar to Saturday when they fired multiple tear gas rounds in confrontations with black-clad activists in the Kowloon area.
Police said they had arrested more than 20 people for offences overnight including unlawful assembly and assault. The protests have become the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule 22 years ago after being governed by Britain since 1842. China’s official news agency Xinhua said on Sunday: “Central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue. We firmly believe that Hong Kong will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges ahead.”
During the day protesters had marched brandishing coloured leaflets, called for a mass strike across Hong Kong on Monday and shouted “Restore Hong Kong” and “Revolution of our time.”
“We’re trying to tell the government to (withdraw) the extradition bill and to police to stop the investigations and the violence,” said Gabriel Lee, a 21-year-old technology student.
Lee said what made him most angry was that the government was not responding to any of the protesters’ demands or examining the police violence.
What started as an angry response to the now suspended extradition bill, has expanded to demands for greater democracy and the resignation of leader Carrie Lam.
“Even if Carrie Lam resigns, its still not resolved. It’s all about the Communist Party, the Chinese government,” said Angie, a 24-year-old working for a non-government organisation.
Protesters on Saturday set fires in the streets, outside a police station and in rubbish bins, and blocked the entrance to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon peninsula.
Shops in the tourist and commercial area Nathan Road, normally packed on a Saturday, were shuttered including 7-11 convenience stores, jewellery chain Chow Tai Fook and watch brands Rolex and Tudor.
Thousands of civil servants joined in the anti-government protests on Friday for the first time since they started in June, defying a warning from authorities to remain politically neutral.
PROTEST TACTICS
The protests have adapted rapidly since the start of June with the movement spreading from the Admiralty area, where the legislative council is located, across to the whole city for the first time.
Previous protests have also targeted mainland visitors to try and make them understand the situation in what is officially termed a Special Administrative Region of China.
Young people have mostly been at the forefront of the protests, infuriated with broader problems including sky-high living costs and what they see as an unfair housing policy skewed towards the rich.
However, the demonstrations have seen people of all ages, including families and the elderly take part.
The protests mark the biggest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took office in 2012.
Hong Kong has been allowed to retain extensive freedoms, such as an independent judiciary but many residents see the extradition bill as the latest step in a relentless march toward mainland control.
Months of demonstrations are taking a growing toll on the city’s economy, as local shoppers and tourists avoid parts of one of the world’s most famous shopping destinations.
Matthew Wang, a 22-year-old marketing executive for a multinational corporation, said that the government was “encouraging people to become more radical to affect decision making because they are not addressing any of the demands.”

180,https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/latest/us-believes-osama-bin-ladens-son-hamza-is-dead-official/,"NEW YORK: The United States believes that Hamza bin Laden, a son of slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and himself a notable figure in the militant group, is dead, a US official said on Wednesday.
The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, provided no further details, including when Hamza died or where.
President Donald Trump earlier on Wednesday declined to comment after NBC News first reported the US assessment. Asked if he had intelligence that bin Laden’s son had been killed, Trump told reporters: “I don’t want to comment on it.”
Separately, the White House declined comment on whether any announcement was imminent.
Hamza, believed to be about 30 years old, was at his father’s side in Afghanistan before the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and spent time with him in Pakistan after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan pushed much of al Qaeda’s senior leadership there, according to the Brookings Institution.
Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces who raided his compound in Pakistan in 2011. Hamza was thought to be under house arrest in Iran at the time, and documents recovered from the compound indicated that aides had been trying to reunite him with his father.
The New York Times reported that the United States had a role in the operation that led to Hamza’s death, which it said took place in the past two years. Reuters could not immediately verify those details.
Still, the US government’s conclusion appears to be a recent one. In February, the State Department said it was offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading “to the identification or location in any country” of Hamza, calling him a key al Qaeda leader.
Introduced by al Qaeda’s chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio message in 2015, Hamza provided a younger voice for the group whose ageing leaders have struggled to inspire militants around the world galvanized by Islamic State, according to analysts.
Hamza has called for acts of terrorism in Western capitals and threatened to take revenge against the United States for his father’s killing, the US State Department said in 2017 when it designated him as a global terrorist.
He also threatened to target Americans abroad and urged tribal groups in Saudi Arabia to unite with Yemen’s al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to fight against Saudi Arabia, it said.
In March, Saudi Arabia announced it had stripped Hamza bin Laden of his citizenship, saying the decision was made by a royal order in November 2018.

KUALA LUMPUR: An undocumented domestic worker has the right to pursue her claim for unpaid wages in Malaysia, a court has ruled, setting a legal precedent migrant rights groups said would help protect human trafficking survivors.
In a landmark ruling this week, a high court in Malaysia said an Indonesian domestic worker who was not paid for nearly five years can pursue her case after it was dismissed earlier by labour authorities because she did not have a work permit.
“This is a precedent for all undocumented workers,” Glorene Das, executive director at the Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Tuesday.
“With this precedent, there is hope for undocumented workers to seek redress in court. They are workers who have been exploited in trafficked and forced labour situations,” she said by phone.
Malaysia relies heavily on foreign workers in areas such as manufacturing, domestic work and on plantations, hosting millions of migrant labourers from countries such as Indonesia, Nepal and Bangladesh.
But many of them are victims of human trafficking who were duped by brokers with promises of lucrative pay, often arriving without a valid work permit, and then suffer abuses later.
The Indonesian woman, who is in her 20s and whose name was withheld by Tenaganita for privacy reasons, fled to the group’s shelter in 2017. Tenaganita helped her file the legal case over unpaid wages.
She sought about 30,000 Malaysian ringgit ($7,300) in unpaid wages at the government’s labour department and then a labour court, but both rejected her case.
She lodged an appeal with a high court last year, which ruled on Monday that it was “premature” for the claim to be thrown out based on the work permit status, according to Tenaganita and the Malaysiakini news website.
The court also ordered the case to be fully heard.
“All I want is my wages that I have worked for, so that I can go home to my family,” the Indonesian woman said in a statement provided by Tenaganita.
The high court and the labour department could not be reached on Tuesday due to a public holiday.
Indonesia and Cambodia, key sources of migrant workers to Malaysia, have in the past temporarily banned their citizens from going to work in Malaysia as maids after cases of abuse.
Malaysia has said this year that it was ready to “declare war” on human trafficking and forced labour, with a review of labour laws was underway.
The U.S. State Department’s 2019 Trafficking in Persons report put Malaysia in its Tier 2 Watch List – the second-lowest ranking – for not meeting the minimum standards in efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

LONDON: Travelers faced a second day of travel disruptions in Britain on Friday after a heat wave gave way to thunderstorms, and technical problems at the air traffic control center grounded many flights at the country’s two main airports on one of the busiest days of the year.
A day after the country potentially recorded its hottest day ever, travelers at London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports faced delays after the UK’s air traffic controller, NATS, said it had identified a technical problem that was causing flight restrictions.
It was not clear if the matter was related to the hot weather or the ensuing thunderstorms.
“We are doing all we can to fix it as soon as possible,” NATS said in a statement.
Eurocontrol, the European air traffic body, said the technical problem is being caused by an “issue with radar displays” and hefty delays are expected for flights arriving at Heathrow and Gatwick for the rest of Friday.
This weekend is a big travel moment as families head off for their summer holidays now that schools have broken up for the academic year.
Britain, along with much of Western Europe, endured one of its hottest days ever on Thursday, potentially its hottest. The country’s weather service said a provisional temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.7 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded at Cambridge University Botanic Garden in eastern England, which if confirmed would be the highest ever recorded in the UK.
The existing record for the UK is 38.5 Celsius (101.3 Fahrenheit), was set in August 2003.
It said “quality control and analysis over the next few days” will determine whether the reading becomes official.
Rail commuters were also facing delays after the heat wave prompted Network Rail to impose speed restrictions in case the tracks buckled. Engineers from the company have been working to get the network back to normal after the track temperatures soared to up to 20 C (68 F) more than the air temperature.
“With the railway being made of metal and moving parts, the sustained high temperatures took their toll in places,” said Phil James of Network Rail. “Everything was done to keep trains moving where possible, and last night hundreds of staff were out fixing the damage and repairing the railway ready for today.”
Passengers using Eurostar services to and from Paris were also facing “severe disruption” due to overhead power line problems in the French capital, which on Thursday recorded its hottest day ever with the temperature rising to 42.6 C (108.7 F).
Authorities across Europe were looking to address the consequences of Thursday’s soaring temperatures, as records that had stood — in some cases for decades — fell.
Europeans and tourists alike jumped into fountains, lakes, rivers or the sea to escape a suffocating heat wave rising up from the Sahara. Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands — all places where air conditioning is not typically installed in homes, cafes or stores — strained under the heat.
In France, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner linked the country’s 60 drowning deaths so far this month indirectly to the current heat wave, warning that drownings are up 30% this month compared to last July.
Castaner noted a rise in people drowning in unguarded bodies of water as they seek relief from high temperatures, some of whom suffer thermal shock when they jump from hot air into cold water.
In Belgium, a 66-year-old woman died near her caravan close to the beach.
The woman was found by a neighbor late Thursday afternoon after she had apparently been basking in the blazing sun. The incident happened in Middelkerke on the Belgian coast as temperatures rose in the region to over 40 degrees Celsius. (104 Fahrenheit)
Middelkerke police commissioner Frank Delva told The Associated Press that the death is “very clearly linked to the heat.”
Emergency services rushed to the scene but could not resuscitate the woman.

No problem, bring plastic waste and get a free meal, said the mayor of an Indian city where the country’s first “garbage cafe” will open next month.
The small restaurant in the eastern city of Ambikapur will provide hearty food to homeless and poor people and encourage citizens to keep their streets clean, said mayor Ajay Tirkey.
“Everybody is welcome to donate plastic. The cafe will be mainly run by women… Preparations are in full swing!” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Wednesday.
Single-use plastics are banned in many states, but Indians still generate 26,000 tonnes of plastic waste every day, according to government data. The waste is often dumped in streets, drains and landfills.
The Garbage Cafe, inspired by similar cafes that have opened in countries including Cambodia and Belgium, wants to change that.
In exchange for one kilogram (2.2 lb) of plastic, the cafe will serve a curry with rice, lentils, and papadams, said Tirkey, estimating that would take a couple of hours to collect.
For half that weight, punters will receive a breakfast of samosas, lentil doughnuts or stuffed flatbreads.
A waste management system set up in 2015 and run by women who go door-to-door collecting plastic for recycling, has helped make Ambikapur one of India’s cleanest cities.
The city built a road made entirely of plastic in 2015, India’s first and earns 1.2 million rupees ($17,400) a month selling plastic and recycled paper to private companies, according to Tirkey.
In a similar move earlier this year, a school in northeastern Assam state started providing free schooling to students in exchange for plastic waste.

SRIHARIKOTA/BENGALURU: India launched a rocket into space on Monday in an attempt to safely land a rover on the moon, the country’s most ambitious mission yet in the effort to establish itself as a low-cost space power.
If successful, the 10-billion-rupee ($146-million) mission will allow Indian scientists to carry out studies regarding the presence of water at the moon’s south pole, unexplored by any other nation before.
“This mission will offer new knowledge about the Moon,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a Twitter post, praising the scientists responsible for what he called a fully indigenous mission.
China, Russia and the United States are the only other nations to have sent missions to the moon.
A live broadcast showed images of the rocket, carrying the unmanned Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, blasting off from a space centre in southern India as thousands of onlookers cheered the launch, delayed for a week by a technical snag.
The boosters separated safely as the craft began its nearly 50-day journey, after which the lander will attempt a controlled landing to deploy a rover at the moon’s south pole.
The spacecraft had been successfully injected into the earth’s orbit, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said.
The next month and a half will see the spacecraft perform crucial maneuvers to ensure a smooth landing, ISRO Chairman K. Sivan said, as the agency’s officials congratulated each other with handshakes and bear hugs after the launch.
“We are going to experience 15 minutes of terror, to ensure that the landing is done safely near the south pole,” he told reporters, describing the final moments before the craft is expected to land on the moon, about 47 days from now.
The space agency has previously said the descent on the moon could be complex, with potential problems from variations in lunar gravity, terrain and dust having to be taken into account.
Globally, Chandrayaan-2, whose name means “moon vehicle” in Sanskrit, will be the year’s third bid at a moon landing, following China’s successful launch of a lunar probe and the Israeli Beresheet spacecraft, which failed and crashed on the moon in April.
India’s space agency suspects the south pole region of the moon contains water in the form of ice as well as craters that could reveal fossilized information about the early solar system.
Last week saw the 50th anniversary of humankind’s first steps on the moon in 1969.

CHENNAI: India’s space agency said it will launch a spacecraft to the south pole of the moon on Monday after stopping an attempt this week.
The Indian Space Research Organisation said the Chandrayaan-2 launch is now set at 2:43 p.m. on Monday. It said Thursday that the cause of the previous technical snag had been identified and corrected.
The earlier launch attempt on Monday was called off less than an hour before the 640-ton, 14-story rocket launcher lifted off.
Chandrayaan, the Sanskrit word for “moon craft,” is designed to land on the lunar south pole and send a rover to explore water deposits that were confirmed by a previous mission that orbited the moon.
Dr K Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, said that the around $140 million Chandrayaan-2 mission was the nation’s most prestigious to date, in part because of the technical complexities of landing on the lunar surface — an event he described as “15 terrifying minutes.”
If India did manage the landing, it would be only the fourth country to do so after the US, Russia and China.

186,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/new-autism-guidelines-focus-in-early-diagnosis-treatment/,"
CHICAGO: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) on Monday issued its first new autism treatment guidelines in 12 years aimed at helping doctors identify at-risk children and getting them the care they need as early as possible.
Since developmental delays are often present in very young children with autism, the report, published in the journal Pediatrics, urges doctors to check for issues during all well-baby visits and refer children for treatment at the first sign of an issue, rather than wait for a formal autism evaluation.
More than five million Americans are living with autism, a spectrum of disorders marked by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive behaviours of widely varying severity.
“The benefit of identifying children as early as possible is they can then be referred for treatment,” Dr Susan Levy, a developmental and behavioural paediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and co-author of the report, said in a phone interview.
Early treatment and particularly behavioural interventions do make a difference, Levy said.
Since 2007, when AAP published its last two guidance documents, the number of children in the United States diagnosed with autism has risen sharply. Autism now affects 1 in 59 children in the United States, up from 1 in 155 in 2007.
In that time, scientists have developed a better understanding of the potential risk factors and genes that contribute to autism, the related medical and behavioural conditions that commonly occur in children with the condition, and have detailed evidence on which interventions work best.
“This report is really focused on educating paediatricians and other healthcare providers about all the options and issues, and working to empower them since they’re in the front lines to make the early referrals,” Levy said.
The report urges doctors to steer families toward interventions backed by research and away from those with flimsy evidence. It specifically calls out many nutritional interventions that “do not have evidence to support their use.”
It also focuses on the need to screen for and treat other conditions that commonly occur in children with autism.
Some 40% of individuals with autism have intellectual disability, the report said, and about 40% to 60% of school-aged children and adults with autism have anxiety disorders. Others include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), language disorders, sleep and feeding disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms and seizures.
The report encourages doctors to share decision making with families and help them plan for when a child transitions to adolescence and adulthood.

187,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/australia-firefighters-accidentally-spread-blaze-ahead-of-heatwave/,"SYDNEY: A backburning operation intended to contain a massive wildfire in eastern Australia sparked out of control, damaging buildings and cutting off major roads, authorities said, as the country heads into another heatwave that may topple temperature records.
The accident occurred about 250 km (155 miles) northwest of Sydney, where firefighters were trying to stop a blaze of some 378,000 hectares (934,000 acres) reaching communities by employing pre-emptive controlled burning.
“We saw a dramatic shift in conditions, a flare-up of fire, some extraordinary behaviour of that fire, and that fire has spread,” New South Wales state Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Monday.
Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the area, Fitzsimmons added, although he did not give an exact figure. There were no new reports of casualties on Monday.
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned nearly 3 million acres of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Bushfires are common in Australia‘s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
Spot fires that would normally be contained on their own have been fanned by wind, coming together into what authorities have called megafires to Sydney’s north, west and south, prompting evacuations and sporadically shrouding the country’s biggest city in smoke.
The Bureau of Meteorology warned of severe to extreme heatwave conditions in the inland parts of the country’s south-east, with temperatures expected to approach or exceed a national average record of 40.3 degrees Celsius (105.4 degrees Fahrenheit).
“We saw significant heat build over Western Australia over the course of last week, and that heat is now pushing east over the continent, which is going to lead to several days of exceptional heat,” bureau climatologist Blair Trewin said in a statement.
“We’re closely monitoring the development and progression of this heat but based on current forecasts we could see that record broken this week.”
The Rural Fire Service’s Fitzsimmons said the heat would exacerbate fire danger, and “despite the very best efforts of everyone, we’re not going to able to contain these fires that we’re expecting later in the week.”

188,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/samoa-extends-measles-state-of-emergency-nz-to-fund-pacific-vaccination-campaign/,"MELBOURNE: The South Pacific island nation of Samoa on Saturday extended a state of emergency due to a measles outbreak which has killed 72 people, mostly infants, as New Zealand announced NZ$1 million ($640,700) to help combat measles in the Pacific.
Samoa said a state of emergency will be extended to December 29 with 5,154 cases of measles now reported since the outbreak started in October. Samoa has a population of only 200,000.
Measles started appearing en masse earlier this year in the New Zealand city of Auckland, a hub for travel to and from small South Pacific islands.
The majority of those who have died in Samoa due to the highly infectious disease have been aged four and under. The island nation had a far lower vaccination rate than its regional neighbours.
Following a mandatory immunization campaign, the Samoan government said approximately 93% of all eligible people in Samoa have now been vaccinated against measles.
“Prevention through vaccination is the most effective way of avoiding illness and a costly health emergency,” New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in a statement announcing the funding.
Under the plan, children under five and new mothers and their families will be targeted for vaccination. The funding would be directed to the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
WHO has described the fact children die from a vaccine-preventable disease as a “collective failure” to protect the world’s most vulnerable children.
The organization said measles infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children.
The picture for 2019 is even worse, it said, with provisional data up to November showing a three-fold increase in case of numbers compared with the same period in 2018.
Measles epidemics have occurred this year in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine.

Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under the Department of Health Services has come up with national guideline for snakebite management in Nepal.
According to EDCD an estimated 20,000 people get  bitten by snakes and 10 per cent of them succumb to snakebites, across the country, every year.
Earlier, there was a protocol on snakebite management published by Ministry of Health in 2003.

The national guideline has explained about kinds of snakes found in Nepal, clinical manifestation of common venomous snakes, diagnosis of snakebite, clinical syndrome of snakebite, first aid treatment for patient of snakebite, referral of snakebite patients to health facilities and their role for snakebite management. The guideline explains about condition of referral, management of snakebite when no anti-venom is available and prevention of snakebite.
“The guideline will provide information on venomous snakes found in Nepal and will help in diagnosis of snakebite and its management. The guideline is intended to ensure standardised, timely and effective management of snake bite in the country. This guideline, I hope will be helpful for all health practitioners, army and police personnel, who have been working in preventing and treating snakebite patients, across the country,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.
The government is committed to achieving the national target, which is aligned with World Health Organisation’s target of 50 per cent reduction in deaths and disabilities due to snakebite by 2030.
“The guideline will help health workers to ensure early intervention and efficient use of anti-venom to save lives,” added Dr Lal. The national guideline is expected to avoid misuse of anti-venom, help early recognition of clinical features of snakebite, reaction to anti-venom, and provide appropriate management including artificial ventilation for patients if required.
Snakebite is life threatening medical emergency and survival of snakebite patients depends largely on appropriate first aid measures and immediate transportation to the nearest health centre where facility to administer anti-snake venom and supportive care is available.
The division has planned to train master trainers to help prevent snakebite in all provinces across the country.
“There will be at least three master trainers in all provinces across the country within this fiscal. These trainers will train other health workers in their respected provinces to help save lives from snakebite,” said Dr Lal.

190,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/thunberg-a-bit-surprised-to-be-time-person-of-the-year/,"MADRID: Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg said she was surprised and honoured on Wednesday to be named Time’s youngest Person of the Year, while adding that others in the global movement she helped inspire deserve to share the accolade.
The 16-year-old Swede has become the face of a new generation of environmental activists, drawing large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences over the past year and a half. Some have welcomed her work, including her speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming. But others have criticized her sometimes combative tone.
“For sounding the alarm about humanity’s predatory relationship with the only home we have, for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders, for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads, Greta Thunberg is Time’s 2019 Person of the Year,” the media franchise said on its website.

As she left a UN climate conference in Madrid, Thunberg told The Associated Press that she was “a bit surprised” at the recognition.
“I could never have imagined anything like that happening,” she said in a phone interview.
“I’m of course, very grateful for that, very honoured,” Thunberg said, but added: “It should be everyone in the Fridays for Future movement because what we have done, we have done together.”
Thunberg said she hoped the message being pushed by her and other activists — that governments need to drastically increase their efforts to combat climate change — is finally getting through. The “Greta effect” has already been linked to a rise in support for environmental parties in Europe.
But she insisted that the media should also pay attention to other activists, particularly indigenous people, whom she said “are hit hardest by the climate and environmental crisis.”
Her concern over the slayings of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon drew a harsh rebuke from the Latin American nation’s president Tuesday.
“Greta said that the Indians died because they were defending the Amazon,” Jair Bolsonaro said. “It’s impressive that the press is giving space to a brat like that,” he added, using the Portuguese word ”pirralha.”
Thunberg responded by changing her bio on Twitter, where she has over 3 million followers, to say “Pirralha.”
The teenager has also been a strong advocate of science, regularly citing complex studies about the causes and impacts of climate change.
On Wednesday, Thunberg used her address at the UN’s annual climate summit to accuse governments and businesses of misleading the public by holding talks that she said aren’t going to stop the world’s “climate emergency.”
“The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR,” she said.
Thunberg cited scientific reports showing that national pledges to reduce reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions aren’t enough to meet the ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsis (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.
“This is not leading, this is misleading,” she told officials, adding that “every fraction of a degree matters.”
Thunberg said the youth climate movement, which has staged repeated worldwide protests attended by hundreds of thousands of people, has managed to spread awareness about the need to urgently emissions and help those already affected by global warming.
“To get in a sense of urgency in the conversation that is very needed right now to be able to move forward,” she said. “That, I think, is our biggest success.”
Asked whether she thought world leaders were beginning to respond to this message, Thunberg told the AP: “They say they listen and they say they understand, but it sure doesn’t seem like it.”
“If they really would listen and understand then I think they need to prove that by translating that into action,” she added.
Thunberg said the experience of the past 15 months, going from solo-protester outside the Swedish parliament to speaking in front of world leaders at the UN General Assembly, had changed her.
“I think life is much more meaningful now that I have something to do that has an impact,” she said.
Thunberg has tried to preserve some privacy despite the relentless interest she’s received from media and adoring fans.
She was mobbed on her arrival in Madrid last week and the attention paid to her appearances at the climate conference has far outstripped that of other events, save for Hollywood stars like Harrison Ford.
“I would like to be left alone,” Thunberg said when asked about her immediate plans. But before heading home to Sweden, to spend Christmas with her family and dogs, she will attend a climate protest Friday in Turin, Italy.
“After that, I have no school to return to until August because I’ve taken a gap year,” she said.
“I will probably continue a bit like now, travel around. And if I get invitations, to come. And just try everything I can,” she added.
Last year’s Time winners included slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi; the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, where five people were shot to death; Philippine journalist Maria Ressa; and two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.

The information was made public at a press conference organised jointly by Bookworm Foundation and Random Readers Society here on Tuesday.

On the occasion, the Foundation’s director Ajit Baral said that new speakers would be given a chance in response to complaints that familiar faces appeared at the forum every year.
More than 110 speakers including over a dozen foreign writers are expected to participate in the festival with more than 40 sessions. Participation of foreign writers is expected to boost the sector of Nepali literature, said Baral.
The festival’s four editions were organised in Kathmandu and the rest in Pokhara. Pokhara was picked for the festival in a bid to promote literary tourism, said Baral, adding that the venue was also shifted due to the 2015 earthquake.
The Society’s President Keshab Sharan Lamichhane claimed that the festival had helped explore Pokhara’s literature.
The DSC Award for South Asian Literature will also be presented at the festival. The award carrying a purse of USD 25,000 is an international literary prize given annually to writers of any ethnicity or nationality writing on South Asian themes such as politics, culture, history and people.

Sanna Marin, 34 from the dominant Social Democrats, was nominated on Sunday. Centre Party chief Katri Kulmuni, 32, will get the finance post when the full new cabinet is announced this week, party members said.
Finland‘s government resigned last week after the Centre Party said it had lost confidence in Social Democrat Prime Minister Antti Rinne over his handling of a postal strike.
The five parties in power – four of them led by women – decided to stay in coalition and continue with the same programmes, but said there would be a reshuffle.
“We want to make the axis between the prime minister and the finance minister work,” Kulmuni said. “That is the foundation for this new generation of collaboration (between the Social Democrats and the Centre Party),” she added.
There was no immediate comment from Marin, the former transport minister.
She has had a swift rise in Finnish politics since becoming head of the city council of her industrial hometown of Tampere at the age of 27.
She will take over in the middle of a wave of strikes, which will halt production at some of Finland‘s largest companies from Monday. The Confederation of Finnish Industries estimates the strikes will cost the companies a combined 500 million euros ($550 million) in lost revenue.
Kulmuni, who previously held the more junior position of Minister of Economic Affairs, replaces Mika Lintila. She took over as the head of the Centre Party from ex-prime minister Juha Sipila in September.
Green Party leader Maria Ohisalo, 34, will continue as interior minister, the Left Alliance’s chairwoman Li Andersson, 32, as education minister and the Swedish People’s Party’s Anna-Maja Henriksson, 55, as justice minister.
Rinne will remain the Social Democrats leader at least until he chairs the party’s conference in June.

More 100 fires remain ablaze in the region, and authorities warned conditions would worsen on Tuesday when temperatures were predicted to top 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).
Seeking to minimise the threat, firefighters safely burned grassland around homes to remove fuel, said NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.
“Firefighters are trying to take advantage of the more moderate conditions… and establish as many significant containment options as they can,” Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. “It is an enormous amount of work with more than 2,000 people out in the field.”
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Such fires are common in Australia‘s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring this year have caught many by surprise. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
In the small city of Hawkesbury, about 50 km (31.1 miles) north-west of Sydney, residents joined firefighters to safeguard their properties.
Mayor Barry Calvert said residents were trying to clear foliage from around their homes, and opening gates to ensure emergency workers have access.
Calvert said many locals were struggling to move animals and livestock in an area renowned for breeding racehorses.
“We’ve opened the showground for people to move their animals, but many people here may have 20 horses and only two horse boxes so they can’t move them quickly,” Calvert told Reuters.
The wildfires have blanketed Sydney – home to more the 5 million people – in smoke and ash for more than a week, turning the daytime sky orange, obscuring visibility and prompting commuters to wear breathing masks.
Australia‘s worst bushfires on record destroyed thousands of homes in Victoria state in February 2009, killing 173 people and injuring 414.

In the book launch interaction held with veteran writers, sociologists and mediapersons, in Kathmandu, on Saturday, litterateur and writer Nayanraj Pandey said the novel ‘Dulari’ elaborated troubles and difficulties faced by Dalit communities especially Musahar.
He said novelist Muna Chaudhary has step-by-step presented the economic exploitation imposed by society on people from marginalised communities and added that the author also cleverly uses Tharu terms and has described them in Nepali to make readers understand. Pandey, however, pointed out that readers would have to keep patience as the main plot unfolds very slowly as the story develops.

Likewise, sociologist Priyanka Kapar said the novel was equally suitable for people from different walks of life as it has touched on the reality of the present state of affairs in Tarai. She said the novel compelled her to recollect how Tharu people practised the ‘untouchability’ with various Dalit communities. She said she was impressed with the author’s way of addressing how women lose their names after getting married in Tarai. However, she pointed out that the novel lacks a historical background of the Musahar community.
Similarly, publishing team member Anbika Giri thanked author Chaudhary for her effort to write a novel on the isolated story. She said the story matches reality as it includes the conditions of people reeling under poverty in Tarai.
Novelist Muna Chaudhary said she found her aspiration to write the novel from her day-to-day experiences and her encouraging husband. She said the novel presents the story of a woman born in a Dalit community and the difficulties and challenges she faces due to limitation set against a marginalised community. The story is narrated from a woman’s perspective.
Muna Chaudhary, who is also treasurer member of ‘Tharu Sahitya Kendra’, has worked on two short stories — ‘Machan’ and ‘Chat’.

There were 96 fires burning in New South Wales, home to Australia’s largest city of Sydney, with only about a half contained and more than 1,600 firefighters deployed to do back burning and create containment lines.
Sydney with its population of 5.2 million has been blanketed by unhealthy haze and smoke for weeks, with conditions worsening on Friday as several fires merged into a giant blaze that may take weeks to put out.
Australia has been through some devastating bushfires before during its hot summers, but fire officials have said that this earlier-than-usual wave of fires has been one of the most persistent and largest.
NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told Australia’s ABC television on Sunday that temperatures will be raising to above normal by Tuesday, reaching 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), threatening the spread of the fires and new blazes.
More smoke is to be expected around Sydney on Sunday as firefighters will do preventive work.
“Crews are going to be actively out there lighting up large tracts of land, kilometres of trails and tracks, and getting into bushland areas in an attempt to bring those fires under control and start putting it into consolidation with containment lines,” Fitzsimmons said.
The fires have been blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson and with much of the country under a long-lasting drought, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been under pressure to address the impact of climate change.
In mid-November, 14 mayors of fire-stricken areas signed a letter urging the government to acknowledge a correlation between climate change and the devastating bushfires, asking also for more funds.
While some additional money has been provided, Morrison has repeatedly rejected any links between the fires and his conservative policies, including support for the coal industry.
On Saturday, the government issued a report suggesting that Australia is on track to meet its emission reduction target, which under the Paris Agreement calls for the country to reduce its emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2030.
The government acknowledged, however, that it uses so-called carryover credits, which allow for counting emissions reduction from the past towards future targets – a practice criticised by the European Union and Pacific countries threatened by climate change.

196,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/nobel-literature-winner-dreams-of-a-new-narrative-style/,"STOCKHOLM: Nobel Literature Prize winner Olga Tokarczuk says she thinks a new sort of fiction may be needed to counteract the modern era’s tendency to isolate and divide people.
In her Saturday lecture in Stockholm ahead of receiving the prize next week, the Polish author complained of the “exhausting white noise of oceans of information” in the internet era.

“It has turned out that we are not capable of bearing this enormity of information, which instead of uniting, generalizing and freeing, has differentiated, divided and enclosed us in individual little bubbles,” she said.
Tokarczuk suggested this discourages people from understanding how actions are interconnected, thus contributing to climate crisis and political tensions.
She said she dreams of a new kind of “fourth-person” narrator in fiction who could encompass the views of each character in a novel.
“We can regard this figure of a mysterious, tender narrator as miraculous and significant. This is a point of view, a perspective, from which everything can be seen. Seeing everything means recognizing the ultimate fact that all things that exist are mutually connected into a single whole, even if the connections between them are not yet known to us,” she said.
Tokarczuk is the 2018 literature laureate.  Her prize was announced only two months ago because the Swedish Academy postponed naming a winner last year due to internal turmoil connected with a sex abuse scandal.
The 2019 Nobel Literature winner, Peter Handke, has also brought controversy to the body because of widespread criticism of him as an apologist for Serbian war crimes during the 1990s. One Swedish Academy member said he is boycotting Nobel ceremonies this year in protest of Handke’s selection and a member of the literature nominating committee has announced his resignation.
Handke jousted with journalists who were questioning his views at a Friday news conference, saying he preferred receiving soiled toilet paper to answering their questions. But his lecture on Saturday was contemplative, telling how his writing was first inspired by religious litanies he heard from a village church. He concluded by reciting a poem by the late Swedish Nobel laureate Tomas Transtomer in which an angel whispers “do not be afraid of being human.”
The Nobel prizes in physics, chemistry, medicine, economics and literature are being presented Tuesday in the Swedish capital.
Earlier Saturday, several Nobel laureates in science spoke about climate change at their news conferences in Stockholm.
Didier Queloz, an astronomer who shares this year’s Nobel physics prize for discovering a planet outside the Earth’s solar system, said people who shrug off climate change on the grounds that humans will eventually leave for distant planets are wrong.
“The stars are so far away I think we should not have any serious hope to escape the Earth,” Queloz said. “We’re not built to survive on any other planet than this one … we’d better spend our time and energy trying to fix it.”

197,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/brick-kiln-workers-health-at-risk/,"Exposure to dust particles, smoke, carbondioxide has made them susceptible
Kathmandu, December 7 
A recent research conducted on 20 brick kilns of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur has revealed that brick kiln workers are at high risk of respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and asthma.
Among the 400 brick kiln workers, a total of 159 participants had suffered from flu one month prior to the survey. Meanwhile, 91 participants (22.8 per cent) had pneumonia.
The research conducted by Resource Centre for Primary Health Care revealed that 75.5 per cent participants were not aware of chronic diseases. The research also revealed that workers were susceptible to body aches and joint pain because they had to carry heavy loads.

“As brick kiln workers have to work with dust and smoke, they are likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses such as asthma, chronic cough, chronic bronchitis, and wheezing, said Dr Kedar Narsingh KC, chest physician.
Dust particles and carbon dioxide from the burning of bricks impacts the health of brick kiln workers and the public. “People are likely to suffer from bronchitis and asthma. Long-term exposure to such particles lead to hypertension, cardiac problems and cancer. Also, exposure to such particles lead to skin problems such as irritation of skin and allergies,” Dr KC added
“The research was conducted to know the health status of workers in brick kilns. It was also conducted to find information regarding occupational safety,” said Purna Duwal, a researcher.
From among the participants, 75.5 per cent did not know about chronic health impacts of dust and smoke.
Meanwhile, 61.8 per cent of the participants knew about the importance of wearing mask. “Though brick kiln workers were given masks to prevent exposure to dust particles and smoke, they did not use them as ordinary masks made breathing difficult,” said Duwal. The research team has recommended that special masks be provided to enable workers to breathe easily. It has also recommended that new tools and equipment be used in brick kilns to lessen the smoke and its health hazards.
The research also revealed that 69.5 per cent brick kiln workers had to spend their own money on treatment.
“Immediate action should be taken to reduce brick kiln workers’ exposure to smoke and dust,” said Dr KC.

198,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/samoa-says-almost-90-of-people-vaccinated-against-measles-after-deadly-outbreak/,"MELBOURNE: Samoa said on Saturday nearly 90% of eligible people had been vaccinated against measles as it lifted a two-day curfew imposed amid an outbreak that has killed 65 in recent weeks.
There were, however, 103 new cases of measles reported since Friday, Samoa‘s Health Ministry said it a statement.
The measles virus has infected almost 4,500 people in the South Pacific nation of just 200,000 since late October. Of those who died, 57 were children under the age of four.
The mandatory immunisation campaign aims to vaccinate 90% of the population, tripling Samoa‘s coverage in just a few weeks. The government said a rate of 89% had been achieved as of Friday.
Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as parents shun immunisation for philosophical or religious reasons, or fears, debunked by doctors, that such vaccines could cause autism.
Samoa and the United Nations appealed on Friday to the international community for about $10.7 million to battle and recover from the crisis.
“The impacts of this emergency will be far reaching on Samoa and our people, particularly our young generations,” Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said in a statement.
“It is imperative therefore to strengthen the culture of acceptance of vaccination in order to create ‘herd immunity’. This is a painful lesson we have learnt from the current crisis.”
New Zealand and a number of other countries and organisations, including the UN agency UNICEF, have delivered thousands of vaccines, medical supplies and have sent medical personnel to help with the outbreak.
The World Health Organisation said this week that measles infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children.
The picture for 2019 is even worse, it said, with provisional data up to November showing a three-fold increase in case numbers compared with the same period in 2018.

199,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/activists-cheer-for-greta-urge-climate-action-in-madrid/,"MADRID: Activists of all ages and from all corners of the planet demanded concrete action Friday against climate change from leaders and negotiators at a global summit in Madrid.
The march was led by dozens of representatives of Latin America’s indigenous peoples — a mark of deference after anti-government protests in Chile, the original host of the summit, resulted in the talks suddenly being moved to Europe for the third year in a row.

Celebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg declared from a stage that “change is not going to come from the people in power, it’s going to come from the masses.” A crowd of thousands responded chanting “Greta! Greta!”
Organisers claimed 500,000 people turned out for the march, but authorities in Madrid put the number at 15,000 without an immediate explanation for the disparity in the count.
The Swedish teen was followed on her first day in Madrid by a swarm of cameras and reporters, as well as curious members of the public wanting to film her on their smartphones, from the very first step she took out of an overnight train from Lisbon.
Two young activists earned cheers as they abseiled from a bridge and strung out a banner saying: “Just 8 years till 1.5 degrees C. HOW DARE YOU?” — a reference to scientists’ forecasts of rising temperatures and what activists complain is a lack of a convincing political response to the threat.
The crush as people tried to get a glimpse of Thunberg led her to pull out shortly after the start of the march, saying police had advised her to leave for safety’s sake, and she climbed into an electric car.
A Madrid police spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity because she wasn’t authorised to be named in media reports said that it had only been “suggested” to that Thunberg leave after she appeared “overwhelmed” by the attention and that police never ordered the activist to abandon on safety grounds.
Earlier in the day, the 16-year-old had said at a press conference that calls for real action against climate change are still being “ignored” by political leaders despite their continuous praise of the global environmental youth movement she helped create.
Thunberg hoped the COP25 summit would lead to “something concrete” and “increasing awareness among people in general,” but she said that after more than one year of student strikes” still basically nothing has happened.”
“The climate crisis is still being ignored by those in power,” she added.
During the Dec. 2-13 talks, nearly 200 countries are meant to streamline the rules on global carbon markets and agree on how poor countries should be compensated for destruction largely caused by emissions from rich nations.
An official directly involved in the negotiations said that despite a few setbacks, the technical negotiations were progressing, although many issues were being left for ministerial-level meetings in the summit’s second and final week.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the discussions, added that a political declaration on greater “ambition” — a buzzword at the summit — was shaping to be “difficult to achieve.”
“A summit that doesn’t end with enhanced ambition would be something that nobody would understand if we take into account what the streets and science are telling us,” the official said.
The talks came as evidence mounts about disasters that could ensue from further global warming, including a study published Friday predicting that unchecked climate change could devastate fishery industries and coral reef tourism.
The study commissioned by 14 nations whose economies rely heavily on the sea says climate change could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in losses by 2050, adding that limiting global warming would lessen the economic impact for coastal countries, but that they also need to adapt to ocean changes.
Demands for greater action by non-governmental organisations and a whole new generation of environment-minded activists were expected to take the spotlight with the presence of Thunberg in Madrid.
Past appearances have won her plaudits from some leaders — and criticism from others who’ve taken offence at the angry tone of her speeches.
Asked about the scepticism on global efforts to fight the warming temperatures expressed by some world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, she said: “Some people want everything to continue like now, they are afraid of the change that we, the youth, are bringing.”
“They try so desperately to silence us,” she added.
Next to her, Vanessa Nakate, a 22-year-old member of Uganda’s chapter of Fridays for Future said that young activists don’t want more promises.
“We are tired of the praises that you keep giving the activists,” she said. “We want you to act.”
During a brief visit to the summit venue earlier on Friday, Thunberg did not appear unsettled by the commotion surrounding her presence.
“It’s absurd. I laugh at it. I do not understand why it has become like this,” she was quoted as saying by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet.
“I don’t like being at the centre of the focus all the time, but this is a good thing,” she told Aftonbladet. “As soon as the media writes about me, they also have to write about the climate crisis. If this is a way to write about the climate crisis, then I guess it is good.”
Separately Friday, an alliance of American states, cities, academic institutions and companies opened its own venue at the UN climate talks, aiming to show that despite the federal administration’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris accord, many Americans remain committed to the treaty’s goal of curbing global warming.
Elan Strait, who manages the “We Are Still In” initiative for the environmental conservationist World Wildlife Fund, said the movement is “a short-term band-aid not only to get those carbon dioxide emissions down but also to encourage policymakers to lay the ground for further achievements.”
“And that, regardless of the colour of the government that is in power,” Strait said.
Over 3,800 organizations and corporations representing 70% of US economic output have joined the coalition, organizers claim, amounting to roughly half of the country’s emissions.

200,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/giant-fire-near-sydney-may-burn-for-weeks-as-people-struggle-to-breathe/,"MELBOURNE: A giant bushfire on the edge of Sydney, which has blanketed the city in smoke causing a spike in respiratory illnesses and the cancellation of outdoor sports, will take weeks to control but will not be extinguished without heavy rains, firefighters said.
Thousands of weary firefighters, who have been battling bushfires for a month, were on Saturday fighting nearly 100 blazes in New South Wales state.
The mega fire north of Sydney, Australia’s largest city, was created on Friday when several fires merged and was now burning across 335,000 hectares (830,000 acres).
“We need flooding rain to put these fires out. That’s really what is going to stop it,” said the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “These will take many weeks to put out.”
Bushfires are common in Australia during the hot summer, which begins in December, but this year the fires started much earlier, blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson.
A three-year drought has left much of Australia tinder dry.
The fires around Sydney have been pumping such vast amounts of smoke into the air that they appear as significant rain on the radars, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.
New South Wales Health said late on Friday that some 1,140 people had sought medical assistance for breathing issues or asthma in the past week – a quarter more than in a typical week. NSW Ambulance fielded about a third more calls.
Six people have been killed, nearly 700 houses burnt down and millions of hectares of land razed.
Strong winds fanned flames towards several suburbs in southwest Sydney on Saturday.
“It’s been going on all day, a fire came from the back and we put it out. But then another one came from the side so the firies covered the house in foam.,” said Luke Wright who helped save his brother’s home.
“The fence has been damaged but that’s about it, very lucky,” Wright told local media.
Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said the worst might still be ahead, with temperatures forecast to rise into the 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in coming days and no meaningful rainfall expected until late January.
“It’s a tough couple of months ahead yet and we’ve already seen the horrific consequences of fire so far this season,” Fitzsimmons told Australia’s 9News on Saturday.
Neighbouring Queensland state was battling some 45 bushfires and temperatures on Saturday as high as 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).

201,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/extreme-heat-hitting-rich-and-poor-harder-global-climate-index-shows/,"MADRID: Worsening heatwaves are taking a heavier toll on rich as well as poor countries, according to an annual ranking that measures the damage done by extreme weather to human life and economies.
The Global Climate Risk Index, published on Wednesday by environmental think-tank Germanwatch, rated Japan as the most weather-affected country in 2018, hit by a triple whammy of extreme summer heat, torrential rainfall and the most powerful typhoon in a quarter-century.
Germany, another industrialised country, was in third position as its hottest-ever April-July period led to the deaths of more than 1,200 people and widespread drought in 2018.
India – in fifth position – suffered one of its longest-ever heatwaves that year, bringing water shortages, crop failures and riots, on top of monsoon floods and two strong cyclones, Germanwatch said in a report.
“Recent science has confirmed the long-established link between climate change and the frequency and severity of extreme heat,” it added in a statement.
In 2018, the severe summer heatwave in Japan killed 138 people and caused more than 70,000 people to be hospitalised with heat stroke and exhaustion, the report said.
Across Europe, scientists calculate extreme heat spells are now up to 100 times more likely than a century ago, it added.
The report noted that the impact of heatwaves on African nations may be under-represented due to a lack of data.
Powerful storms, meanwhile, left a trail of destruction in 2018, with the Philippines second in the climate risk index due to large losses inflicted by top-strength Typhoon Mangkhut.
Madagascar was the fourth most weather-hit country as two cyclones killed about 70 people and forced 70,000 to seek refuge.
In Kenya and Rwanda – seventh and eighth in the index – seasonal rains were much heavier than normal, causing floods that destroyed homes and livestock and fuelled diseases.
Laura Schaefer, a policy advisor with Germanwatch, told journalists at the U.N. climate talks in Madrid that the index results showed that the “signs of climate crisis”, on all continents, could no longer be ignored.
“But climate impacts most existentially hit developing countries and communities around the world – and create a real climate crisis for millions of people,” she said, adding that the poor had the fewest resources to cope.
Between 1999 and 2018, seven of the 10 places most affected by extreme weather were lower-income developing nations, with Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti at the top, Germanwatch said.
In the past 20 years, nearly half a million deaths were directly linked to more than 12,000 extreme weather events worldwide, while economic damages exceeded $3.5 trillion, the report said.
At the U.N. climate talks on Wednesday, Chile’s environment minister, who is presiding over the conference, and U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa told journalists Latin American nations were vulnerable to weather disasters fuelled by climate change, highlighting the need for them to become more resilient.
Espinosa said her own country, Mexico, suffered every year from droughts, floods and wildfires.
“It is not about whether this year it will be bad. No, it is about how bad and where?” she said. “This is the reality of almost all the countries in the region.”
Germanwatch joined developing states and aid agencies in urging U.N. negotiators to regularly assess the needs of vulnerable countries struggling with “loss and damage” linked to climate change, and provide new funding to repair it.
Wealthy nations have long resisted pressure to stump up such finance, beyond expanding insurance programmes. But as the cost of extreme weather increases globally and planet-heating emissions continue to rise, that pressure is growing.
Renato Redentor Constantino, head of the Philippines-based Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities, said it was “plainly unacceptable” that those suffering the most had done the least to cause the problem, given their historically low emissions.
“The extreme weather events we have been facing are a result of emissions that the world failed to eliminate,” he said.

The report states that 11 countries in WHO South-East Asia Region — Bangladesh, Bhutan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Timor-Leste — had an estimated eight million cases and 11,600 malaria deaths, respectively 69 and 70 per cent less compared to 2010. Moreover, the Maldives and Sri Lanka have been certified malaria-free countries while Timor-Leste and Bhutan are close to elimination target.
The WHO report further stated that India reduced its reported cases by half as compared to 2017 and Bangladesh and Thailand also reported a substantial decline in reported cases.
All countries in the region are on target to achieve more than 40 per cent reduction in case incidence by 2020, and all have strategic plans for malaria elimination by 2030.
“There is a strong commitment to eliminate malaria in the region, reflected in the commendable intense efforts and progress being made by member countries. This momentum needs to be sustained and further accelerated to prevent, rapidly detect and treat malaria, to benefit everyone, everywhere,” Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia was quoted in the statement released by WHO.
However, the report claimed that despite progress, an estimated 1.61 billon people in the region are still at risk of contracting malaria with the disease being endemic in nine countries.
The progress and challenges in malaria elimination are periodically reviewed by member countries.

203,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/women/first-period-in-school-award-winning-uk-film-upends-bloody-shame/,"
LONDON: The award-winning short film, “My Time”, was inspired by seeing a friend being bullied at school for having a period stain on her clothes, its director Giulia Gandini said on Tuesday.
The young girl had just started her first period but the teacher refused to allow her to use the toilet during class – a rule that applies to seven out of 10 girls in Britain today, according to the children’s charity Plan International.

“I wish that I had seen this film when I was 12,” the London-based director, who grew up in Italy, said at a screening on Tuesday. “I developed this relationship to menstrual blood that was very negative.”
Gandini’s film is the latest to tackle the stigma around menstruation, following last year’s Bollywood movie “Padman” and the Netflix documentary “Period. End of Sentence.”, which won an Oscar this year.
Shame can be deadly. In Nepal, the centuries-old Hindu practise of “chhaupadi”, where women are banished from their homes during their periods, has led to numerous deaths from suffocation and snake bites.
Despite government schemes to provide free sanitary products in British schools, “period shaming” persists, with one in three women saying they have been bullied, isolated or joked about over “the curse”, research by the charity ActionAid found.
“It was a deliberate choice to set it in the UK – you still have this kind of shame and taboo,” said Gandini, adding that she only “started questioning why I was feeling so awful about something so natural” years after her friend’s humiliation.
Gandini said her goal as a filmmaker is to dispel stigmas and show the reality of young women’s lives in a positive light.
“Films don’t only reflect culture but they have the power to shape it,” she said, highlighting negative comments she received from men while making the film, with some asking, “Why should I care about menstrual blood?”
“My Time” has won multiple awards, including at the Chicago International Children’s Film Festival, London’s TweetFest and Sweden’s BUFF International Film Festival.
Gandini said her film has a happier ending than the event she witnessed at school, with a clear feminist message of “being proud of who you are”.

204,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/drug-can-curb-dementias-delusions-researchers-find/,"SAN DIEGO: A drug that curbs delusions in Parkinson’s patients did the same for people with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia in a study that was stopped early because the benefit seemed clear.
If regulators agree, the drug could become the first treatment specifically for dementia-related psychosis and the first new medicine for Alzheimer’s in nearly two decades. It targets some of the most troubling symptoms that patients and caregivers face — hallucinations that often lead to anxiety, aggression, and physical and verbal abuse.
Results were disclosed Wednesday at a conference in San Diego.
“This would be a very important advance,” said one independent expert, Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation.
Although the field is focused on finding a cure for dementia and preventing future cases, “there is a huge unmet need for better treatment” for those who have it now, said Maria Carrillo, the Alzheimer’s Association’s chief science officer.
The drug is pimavanserin, a daily pill sold as Nuplazid by Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. It was approved for Parkinson’s-related psychosis in 2016 and is thought to work by blocking a brain chemical that seems to spur delusions.
About 8 million Americans have dementia, and studies suggest that up to 30% of them develop psychosis.
“It’s terrifying,” said Dr. Jeffrey Cummings of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. “You believe that people might be trying to hurt you. You believe that people are stealing from you. You believe that your spouse is unfaithful to you. Those are the three most common false beliefs.”
He consults for Acadia and helped lead the study, which included about 400 people with dementia and psychosis. All were given a low dose of the drug for three months, and those who seemed to respond or benefit were then split into two groups. Half continued on the drug and the others were given dummy pills for six months or until they had a relapse or worsening of symptoms. Neither the patients nor their doctors knew who was getting what.
Independent monitors stopped the study when they saw that those on dummy pills were more than twice as likely as those on the drug to relapse or worsen — 28% versus nearly 13%.
There were relatively few serious side effects — 5% in the drug group and 4% in the others. Headaches and urinary tract infections were more common among those on the drug. Two deaths occurred, but study leaders said neither was related to the drug.
Carrillo said the study was small, but the drug’s effect seemed large, and it’s not known whether the federal Food and Drug Administration would want more evidence to approve a new use.
Current anti-psychotic medicines have some major drawbacks and are not approved for dementia patients.
“They’re often used off label because we have very few other options,” Fillit said.
All carry warnings that they can raise the risk of death in elderly patients, as does Nuplazid.
Cost could be an issue — about $3,000 a month. What patients pay can vary depending on insurance coverage.

205,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/restoring-forests-1-tree-at-a-time-to-help-repair-climate/,"MADRE DE DIOS, PERU: Destruction of the forests can be swift. Regrowth is much, much slower.
But around the world, people are putting shovels to ground to help it happen.
They labour amid spectacular recent losses — the Amazon jungle and the Congo basin ablaze, smoke from Indonesian rainforests wafting over Malaysia and Singapore, fires set mostly to make way for cattle pastures and farm fields. Between 2014 and 2018, a new report says, an area the size of the United Kingdom was stripped of forest each year.


Rebuilding woodland is slow and often difficult work. And it requires patience: It can take several decades or longer for forests to regrow as viable habitats, and to absorb the same amount of carbon lost when trees are cut and burned.
And yet, there is urgency to that work — forests are one of the planet’s first lines of defense against climate change, absorbing as much as a quarter of man-made carbon emissions each year.
Through photosynthesis, trees and other plants use carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to produce chemical energy to fuel their growth; oxygen is released as a byproduct. As forests have shrunk, however, so has an already overloaded Earth’s capacity to cope with carbon emissions.
Successful reforestation programs take into account native plant species. They are managed by groups with a sustained commitment to monitoring forests, not just one-off tree planting events. And usually, they economically benefit the people who live nearby — for instance, by creating jobs, or reducing erosion that damages homes or crops.
The impact could be great: A recent study in the journal Science projected that if 0.9 billion hectares (2.2 billion acres) of new trees were planted — around 500 billion saplings — they could absorb 205 gigatonnes (220 gigatons) of carbon once they reached maturity. The Swiss researchers estimated this would be equivalent to about two-thirds of man-made carbon emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
Other scientists dispute those calculations, while some fear the theoretical promise of tree-planting as an easy solution to climate changes could distract people from the range and scope of the responses needed.
But all agree that trees matter. And in many places around the world, people are working to revive them:
— In a region of southeastern Peru called Madre de Dios, forestry researcher Jhon Farfan inspects lands where the forest has already been lost to illegal gold mining.
After cutting and burning centuries-old trees, miners used diesel pumps to suck up deep layers of the earth, then pushed the soil through filters to separate out gold particles. To turn gold dust into nuggets, they stirred in mercury, which binds the gold together but also poisons the land.
Left behind are patches of desert-like land — dry, sandy, stripped of topsoil and ringed by trunks of dead trees.
Last December, Farfan and other scientists with the Peru-based nonprofit CINCIA planted more than 6,000 saplings of various species native to this part of the Amazon, including the giant shihuahuaco, and tested different fertilizers. Since the project began three years ago, the team has planted more than 42 hectares (115 acres) with native seedlings, the largest reforestation effort in the Peruvian Amazon to date.
— After miners left West Virginia’s Cheat Mountain in the 1980s, there was an effort to green the coal mining sites to comply with US law. The companies used heavy machinery to push upturned soil back into place, compacting the mountainside with bulldozers. The result was soil so packed in that rainwater couldn’t seep down, and tree roots couldn’t expand.
Companies planted “desperation species” — grasses with shallow roots or non-native trees that could endure, but wouldn’t reach their full height or restore the forest as it had been. On Cheat Mountain and at other former mining sites across Appalachia, more than a million acres of former forests are in similar arrested development.
Now Michael French, director of operations for the Kentucky-based nonprofit Green Forests Work, and his colleagues are collaborating with the US Forest Service to restore native Appalachian forests and the rare species they support — by first tearing down other trees.
Green Forests Work has reforested around 800 acres within the Monongahela, and it is taking a similar approach to other former mining sites across Appalachia, having reforested around 4,500 total acres since 2009.
— Maria Coelho da Fonseca Machado Moraes, nicknamed Dona Graça, runs a tree nursery that grows seedlings of species native to Brazil’s lesser-known jungle — the Atlantic coastal rainforest.
She collaborates with a nonprofit group called Save the Golden Lion Tamarin, which works to protect and restore the forest habitat of the endangered namesake monkey. “The Atlantic rainforest is one of the planet’s most threatened biomes, more than 90% of it was deforested,” said Luis Paulo Ferraz, the nonprofit’s executive secretary. “What is left is very fragmented.”
As she nears 50, Dona Graça says she is furious at what has happened to the forest, which was whittled down to allow for the urban expansion of Rio de Janeiro and other cities.
And so, between feeding her chickens and raking the leaves, she grows seedlings of rare species. She mixes limestone and clay, places it in plastic nursery bags and plants seeds in them. She irrigates them with water and cow urine.
Local replanting efforts — which aim to reconnect fragmented parcels of forest — often use the seedlings from Dona Graça’s nursery.
She does this, she said, for posterity.
“In the future when I pass away … that memory I tried to leave for the people is: It’s worth it to plant, to build,” she said.

The 233-year-old Academy was forced to introduce a several new measures after a sex scandal involving the husband of a former member escalated into a bitter row that resulted in them having to postpone the award for 2018.
One of the actions taken was adding external members to assist the Nobel committee choose prize candidates for the 18-man strong Academy to vote on.
“I leave my job in the Nobel Committee because I have neither the patience nor the time to wait for the result of the work to change that has been started,” author Kristoffer Leandoer said in an article published in Svenska Dagbladet. “The Academy and I have a different perspective on time, one year is far too long in my life and far too short in life of the Academy.”
Leandoer said quitting was not linked to the decision to award the 2019 prize to controversial Austrian writer Peter Handke, for which the Academy has received criticism both domestically and internationally.
The Academy confirmed in a statement that Leandoer and Gun-Britt Sundstrom had left the Nobel committee, which until today was comprised of four members of the Swedish Academy and five external members.
Sundstrom could not immediately be reached for comment.
“We are grateful for the significant effort they made during the year and we are now reviewing how the work of the Nobel Committee will be organised for the 2020 Nobel Prize in literature, ” Mats Malm, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, said in the statement.

MELBOURNE: The number of suspected cases of measles on the Pacific island of Samoa has more than doubled over the past week to 3,530 and deaths related to the outbreak rose to 48 from 20 a week ago, the country’s Ministry of Health said on Sunday.
Samoa has become vulnerable to measles outbreaks as the number of people becoming immunised has declined with the World Health Organisation (WHO) saying vaccine coverage is just about 31%.
The government started a mandatory vaccination programme on Nov 20 after declaring a state of emergency due to the outbreak. The health ministry said in its statement that 57,132 people have since been vaccinated.
Schools and universities have been closed and most public gatherings banned on the island state of just 200,000, located south of the equator and halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand.
Of the 48 deaths, 44 were among children under the age of four. Since Saturday, there have been 173 new cases of measles recorded and four people have died.
Neighbouring New Zealand and a number of other countries and organisations, including the UN agency UNICEF, have delivered thousands of vaccines, medical supplies and have sent medical personnel to help with the outbreak.
Measles, a highly contagious virus that spreads easily through coughing and sneezing, has been reported also in other Pacific nations, including Tonga and Fiji, but there have been no reports of deaths and the countries have greater vaccination coverage.
Tonga’s ministry of health said in a statement late last week that there were 394 cases of suspected measles identified, but only eight people required hospitalisation.
Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as parents shun immunisation for philosophical or religious reasons, or fears, debunked by doctors, that such vaccines could cause autism.

208,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/students-stage-global-strikes-to-pressure-un-climate-summit/,"LISBON: Thousands of people in Asia and Europe joined rallies demanding more action on climate change on Friday, aiming to force political leaders to come up with urgent solutions at a United Nations conference next week.
Swedish activist Greta Thunberg had been due to join a student strike in Lisbon, but her environmentally friendly voyage across the Atlantic from New York by yacht was hit by high winds, delaying her by a few days, she told social media followers.
Portugal’s student movement still expected thousands to join marches on Friday, building on the famous campaigner’s imminent arrival to mobilise ahead of the United Nations climate summit in Madrid from December 2-13.
“We wish she’d been here, but the movement has to carry on without her. We’ve got to send our message and pressure politicians ahead of the climate summit,” Marianna Louca, 14, told Reuters in Lisbon.
Friday’s climate strikes are expected to take place in 2,300 cities in 153 countries around the world, according to the climate campaign group Friday For Future.
It comes as experts have warned that global temperatures could rise sharply this century with destructive consequences after greenhouse gas emissions hit record levels.
Dozens of young people gathered in Bangkok for a climate strike in solidarity with others around the world, chanting: “No more coal, no more oil, keep the carbon in the soil.”
In Warsaw, activists, some in gas masks, waved banners saying: “Save our planet” and “Poland without coal 2030”.
In Berlin, protesters in swimming costumes dived into the chilly river Spree, holding up a white box in a symbolic attempt to rescue the government’s climate change package.
Activists protested at Amazon sites around France, using the annual Black Friday shopping frenzy to denounce what they said was the destructive effect of rampant consumerism, in a backlash against the event driven in part by environmental concerns.
Several dozen protesters staged a dawn sit-in outside an Amazon building in the Clichy district of Paris, holding a sign saying: “No to Amazon and its world.”
In Australia, students in Sydney and other cities walked out of class, saying more should be done to combat the country’s bushfire crisis, which many see as a result of climate change.
Australia has for weeks been battling wildfires, which have killed at least four people, burnt about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroyed more than 500 homes.
Holding home-made signs, including “The climate is changing, why aren’t we?”, demonstrators in Sydney accused the government of inadequate action in addressing the bushfire crisis. Smoke from bushfires in New South Wales state formed a haze overhead.
“Our government’s inaction on the climate crisis has supercharged bushfires,” said 18-year-old Shiann Broderic, one of the event’s organisers, whose home was destroyed in a bushfire.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has rejected suggestions his government is not doing enough on climate change.
Australia has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2030, but recent data shows emissions are unchanged.

209,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/women/indonesian-gymnast-dropped-after-told-shes-no-longer-a-virgin/,"KUALA LUMPUR: An Indonesian female gymnast training for a major sport event has been sent home on grounds she was no longer a virgin, her family said on Friday, a claim rejected by officials who insisted it was over disciplinary issues.
Shalfa Avrila Sania, 17, had been due to leave for the biennial Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines on Nov. 26 until she was dismissed suddenly from the training in mid-November, her lawyer and family said.
“The coach said my daughter always goes out late with her male friends and their interrogation showed she was no longer a virgin,” her mother Ayu Kurniawati told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Indonesia‘s East Java province.
“I was shocked. I want my daughter’s name cleared,” the mother-of-two added.
Indonesia‘s sports ministry denied the claim on Friday, saying the dismissal was due to performance and disciplinary issues.
“We will take firm action if the athlete was sent back due to questions over her virginity because this is a matter of privacy, dignity and has nothing to do with performance,” it said in a statement according to Indonesia‘s Detik news website.
Kurniawati said her daughter had won nearly 50 medals since she took up the sport when she was eight, and rejected doubts over her performance.
The family has sent a letter to the ministry to protest her dismissal alongside a medical report that showed her hymen was intact, their lawyer Imam Muklas said by phone.
Parts of Indonesia – the world’s most populous Muslim country – remain conservative and some still value female virginity highly, although pre-marital sex is not uncommon among the younger generation.
Human rights groups have previously opposed “virginity tests” on Indonesian women seeking to join the police or military, saying the practice was unscientific and degrading.
Other attempts to introduce virginity tests on students in some Indonesian schools faced opposition, including from among Islamic clerics.

210,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/health/mris-of-dense-breasts-find-more-cancer-but-also-false-alarms/,"Giving women with very dense breasts an MRI scan in addition to a mammogram led to fewer missed cancers but also to a lot of false alarms and treatments that might not have been needed, a large study found.
The results give a clearer picture of the tradeoffs involved in such testing, but they can’t answer the biggest question — whether it saves lives.

For women with dense breasts trying to decide on screening, “the dilemma remains,” Dr Dan Longo of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote in an editorial published with the study on Wednesday.
About half of women over 40 have dense breasts and about 10% have very dense ones. That raises their risk of developing cancer and makes it harder to spot on mammograms if they do. US regulators are making rules to require that women get breast density information when they have mammograms, and many places provide it now. But what to do if you have dense breasts is unclear — it’s not known if more or different types of screening such as MRIs or ultrasounds help.
The study involved more than 40,000 Dutch women ages 50 to 75 with very dense breasts who had normal results from a mammogram, a screening X-ray offered every two years in the Netherlands. About 8,000 of them also were offered an MRI scan, which uses powerful magnets to create detailed images, and 4,783 women agreed.
Researchers then tracked how many breast cancers were detected in each group within two years. Finding more of these “interval cancers” implies that the initial screening may have missed them.
The rate of these cancers after two years was twice as high in the group that was only offered mammograms. This suggests that adding MRIs to initial screening did catch more cancers, but they also gave a lot of false alarms— about 80 per 1,000 scans. Three-quarters of women who had a biopsy after a questionable MRI turned out not to have cancer.
MRIs also led to more side effects during the scan or later testing, such as fainting or problems from an IV. And they cost much more than mammograms.
The study only looked at the first two years of screening with MRIs and it’s too soon to say whether the test will save lives.
Without such evidence, it’s tough to say what value there is in finding more cancers, especially many very small, early-stage ones, Longo wrote. Doctors already know that some of these will never cause symptoms or become life-threatening.
“Our dilemma is that, for most tumours, we cannot tell the difference between cancers that can kill you and those that cannot,” he wrote.

211,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/going-green-does-offsetting-carbon-emissions-count/,"
LONDON: Among the most hotly contested topics at international climate change talks in Madrid on December 2-13 will be the role of market-based mechanisms for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon offsets.
WHAT IS OFFSETTING AND WHY IS IT A TRICKY TOPIC?
Carbon offsetting allows a country to help reach its own emissions reduction targets by funding emission reductions in another country. Companies are also increasingly using carbon credits to offset their emissions.
The first major offsetting scheme, the UN’s clean development mechanism (CDM), was set up under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, in which 190 countries agreed to country-by-country emission reduction targets.
The scheme was designed to help fund emission reduction projects in developing countries, while also providing offset credits to the developed world to help meet its Kyoto targets.
Negotiators in Madrid are set to discuss what kind of offsets, if any, should be used to meet the targets set out in the 2015 Paris agreement and how they should be monitored, following some cases where emissions cuts did not materialise.
The issue of which country claims the emission reduction will also need to be thrashed out, to avoid double counting.
WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS QUALIFY?
Carbon offset schemes cover all greenhouse gases but are measured in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent and can be awarded carbon credits.
More than 8,100 projects in 111 countries have registered with the CDM scheme, which has handed out over 2 billion carbon credits, called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), representing 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide reduction.
Projects registered under the scheme range from capturing and using methane gasses in pig manure to create electricity to replacing traditional wood and coal-burning cookstoves with cleaner alternatives such as ethanol. Offsets can be bought by individuals, companies or countries.
WHAT ABOUT CARBON SINKS?
Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation, or REDD+, allows developing nations to earn carbon credits, which they can sell, when they reduce deforestation and degradation or conserve, rehabilitate and replant forests.
To qualify, carbon credits from REDD+ projects must be approved by the UNs Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
DO THEY WORK?
Proponents say offsetting can channel much-needed climate finance to developing countries.
Critics say offsetting emissions reduces incentives for the drastic emissions cuts needed to slow global warming and does not always bring the intended benefits; for instance, new trees may not grow as quickly as promised.

212,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/environment/greenhouse-gases-surge-to-record-in-2018-exceeding-10-yr-average-rate-un/,"
GENEVA: Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit a new record in 2018, rising faster than the average rise of the last decade and cementing increasingly damaging weather patterns, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Monday.
The UN agency’s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin is one of a series of studies to be published ahead of a UN climate change summit being held in Madrid next week and is expected to guide discussions there. It measures the atmospheric concentration of the gases responsible for global warming, rather than emissions.

“There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases’ concentration in the atmosphere – despite all the commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.
“This continuing long-term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea-level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems.”
The concentration of carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels that is the biggest contributor to global warming, surged from 405.5 parts per million in 2017 to 407.8 ppm in 2018, exceeding the average rate of increase of 2.06 ppm in 2005-2015, the WMO report said.
Irrespective of future policy, carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for centuries, locking in warming trends.
“It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago,” Taalas said.
Levels of methane – a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 – and nitrous oxide also hit new records, the report said.
The UN Environment Programme’s annual “emissions gap” report, due on Tuesday, assesses whether countries’ emissions reduction policies are enough.

“We still have a big problem at hand,” Samoa’s Director General of Health Leausa Take Naseri said in a video statement.
In this image made from video, New Zealand Medical Assistance Team Dr Scott Wilson talks about the measles outbreak at a clinic, Monday, Nov 25, 2019, in Apia, Samoa. Photo: Newshub via AP
He said more than 140 new cases of people contracting the virus had been recorded within the past day, bringing the total to about 2,200 cases since the outbreak began last month. He said there are about 20 critically ill children who remain in hospital intensive care units.
Samoa declared a state of emergency nine days ago, closing all its schools, banning children from public gatherings and mandating that everybody gets vaccinated. Teams of people have been travelling the country administering thousands of vaccines.
The government also shut down a private clinic and is investigating how hundreds of vaccines were taken without authorisation and then sold for a fee.
The median age of those who have died is 13 months, according to government figures. The deaths include 24 children under the age of 5, 11 of whom were infants under 12 months. The other person who died was in their 30s.
In all, 679 people have been admitted to Samoan hospitals with the disease, accounting for two-thirds of all recent hospital admissions. A majority have been discharged, with about 183 remaining in hospitals.
“These hospitals are not designed to deal with this,” Dr Scott Wilson told Newshub in the capital, Apia. “The minute you get hospitals running at 200 to 300 per cent capacity — I think it speaks for itself. It’s incredibly serious.”
Figures from the World Health Organization and UNICEF indicate that measles immunisation rates among Samoan infants have fallen steeply from over 70% in 2013 to under 30% last year.
Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at New Zealand’s University of Auckland, said the Samoan government halted its immunisation program for several months last year after two infants died from a medical mishap involving a vaccine.
Tonga, Fiji and New Zealand have also reported outbreaks of measles but on a smaller scale than in Samoa. American Samoa, which has declared a public health emergency, is requiring that travellers from Samoa and Tonga prove they have been vaccinated or are immune from measles before being allowed into the US territory.

MELBOURNE: Deaths related to measles, mostly among small children, have more than tripled to 20 in the past week on the Pacific island of Samoa, the government has said eight days after declaring a state of emergency over the outbreak.
The island state of just 200,000, located south of the equator and halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, declared a measles epidemic late in October after the first deaths.
The government has identified 1,644 suspected cases of measles, more than doubling over the past week, with deaths rising to 20 from six, it said on Friday. Children younger than five accounted for all but one of the deaths.
The staff of UN agency UNICEF have delivered 110,500 doses of measles-containing vaccines this week as they fanned out across Samoa to boost its mandatory immunisation effort, the agency said in a statement.
It has also worked with governments of other tiny Pacific nations to run immunisation campaigns and develop preparedness plans to combat a regional outbreak, it added.
Australia is sending a specialist team of doctors, nurses and public health experts to Samoa, along with equipment and supplies, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Spine surgeons today stressed on maintaining healthy spine to live healthy life.
Spine surgeons from various countries, who have gathered here for the Himalayan Spine Symposium and the fifth annual conference, said spine health problems were rising along with the ageing population.
The doctors will be presenting their papers, discuss about innovative methods and technologies used in treating spine problems, share their experiences in the treatment of spine problems during the two-day conference.
As many as 95 spine surgeons from Nepal, India, Australia, Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, Norway, South Korea and the USA are participating in the conference that kicked off today.
The participants shared their papers on spine problems such as disc disease, adult spine deformity, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, shoulder balance, lumbar disc herniation, and cervical spine fracture among various other issues related with spine problems.
Interactions and panel discussions are also part of the conference where the surgeons will be discussing about the issues of spine problems across the world and new and advanced techniques and treatment methods.
The most common spine problem in Nepal is injuries. “We see a lot of patients with spine trauma especially from fall injuries, fall from a tree or from cliff, followed by motor vehicle accidents and infections such as tuberculosis. The conference helps all to learn from experience sharing by the doctors,” said Dr Gaurav Raj Dhakal, spine surgeon at National Academy of Medical Sciences, Bir Hospital who is also joint-secretary of the Association of Spine Surgeons of Nepal.
“As the ageing population is rising in the country, we need to raise awareness about spine problems both among adult and elderly.
Spine health is necessary as it is important for movement of limbs,” said Rabindra Lal Pradhan, chairman of the association, who also is the head of orthopaedic departments at Kathmandu Medical College and Teaching Hospital “Such conferences will help to educate both the doctors and public about the importance of spine health. The conference will also help the doctors exchange their ideas and experience on treating spine problems and technologies used during the treatment,” added Pradhan.

This step of the department came immediately after it had conducted monitoring the industries operating in more than 12 places in the country.
Department director-general Dr Matina Baidya said that the production of 22 industries have been banned as these industries produced, distributed and sold inedible and unhealthy food items and drinking water, flouting the agreement with the Department and the license.
However, she refused to divulge the names of the industries facing the ban, claiming action would be taken against these industries as per the Food Quality Act, 2023 BS if the charges against them were proven.
The Act stipulates a fine of Rs 50,000 and up to five years imprisonment.

According to Fast Track Project Implementation Division Chief and Lieutenant Colonel Bishwa Bandhu Pahadi, tress along the track were needed to be removed for the implementation of some 77-kilometre project.
The division has obtained permission from the Forest Ministry for cutting down trees with a condition to remain within the periphery of 50 metres of the track in hilly areas and 100 metres in the Tarai.
To meet the environmental standard, 25 trees should be planted for every tree cut down in the process and NA is producing approximately 150 thousand nursery plants in Nijgadh and Rajdurbar. Trees transplantation in the areas where trees were cut has also begun and has already planted five thousand trees at several places of Kohalbi Municipality, NA said.

With the start of snowfall in the upper regions of the district, people started to migrate to lower regions to avoid the severe cold, lack of pasture land to graze their animals and difficulties to herd the animals in the winter season, informed a local yak herder Karma Lama.

According to locals, people in the region usually maintain two kharka (place to house cattle), in the upper and lower regions, keeping in mind the varying weather conditions.
During the three winter months — November, December and January — people migrate to lower regions including Taragaun, Dharapani, Danakui in the district along with their domesticated animals that are herded in the upper region in the summer season, for grazing, added local Asmita Gurung. 
“The pastures up there are covered with snow during the winter season forcing us to move down to warmer regions,” added Gurung.
According to the chairperson of Chame Rural Municipality, Lokendra Ghale, people migrate back to the upper regions at the end of February.

Dhanusha District Police Office has started investigating the bomb blast in which three persons were killed in Mahendranagar of Chhireswor Municipality, Dhanusha.
Province 2 Police Chief DIG Pradumnna Karki said police had narrowed down the probe and would reach conclusion as early as possible. “The probe is under way from multiple angles. So, we shall unearth the reason behind the blast at the earliest,” said DIG Karki.
Rajesh Sah, his son Anant and Police Inspector Amir Dahal were killed when a pressure cooker bomb planted at the second main gate of Rajesh’s house detonated on Friday night. Though police have launched investigation from multiple angles, they are yet to find the cause behind the explosion. Police believe they will get a tip-off after aggrieved family members recover from the shock.
Police have interrogated three leaders, including Dhanusha in-charge of Netra Bikram Chand-led Communist Party of Nepal Lalita Mahara who is in police custody. “Preliminary investigation showed that the incident occurred due to personal animosity and financial transaction,” said a police officer involved in the probe, adding, “But, the investigation is under way from other angles as well.”
Deceased Rajesh’s family members have said the bomb went off due to negligence on the part of Inspector Dahal as he touched the bag with IED with a stick recklessly. Police, however, refuted the allegation saying that the bomb went off as it was a time bomb.
Chhireswor Municipality Mayor Yogendra Pajiyar said that health condition of deceased Rajesh’s father Bhikhari Sah, his youngest son Prakash Sah and daughter Anjali Sah was improving. All of them are being treated at Dharan-based BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences.
Rajesh and his son Anant’s bodies were cremated on the banks of Jalad River at Chhireswor Municipality, while Inspector Dahal’s body was cremated at Pashupati Aryaghat.
A public holiday was given  in the municipality today to mourn the deceased in the bomb blast. Market places and educational institutions also pulled down their shutters.
Province 2 Chief Minister Lalbabu Raut reached Sah’s house  today and pledged to provide expenses for treatment of the injured in the explosion.  CM Raut vowed to bring the guilty to book. “Police will investigate the incident and punish those guilty of the heinous crime,” he added.

253,https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/my-nepal-stay-has-been-a-self-actualising-experience-indian-ambassador-to-nepal-manjeev-singh-puri/,"When Manjeev Singh Puri took up his assignment as Indian Ambassador to Nepal in 2017, Kathmandu’s relationship with New Delhi was passing through rough waters. One of the daunting challenges before Puri was to restore and normalise the time-tested relationship between Nepal and India so that both countries continued to reap mutual benefits. Ambassador Puri did precisely that without being too visible. About three years later, inspiring developments have taken place in the Nepal-India partnership. As he wraps up his Nepal stay, Prakash Rimal and Roshan S Nepal of The Himalayan Times caught up with Ambassador Puri. “I am happy that actually in my time here in Nepal, we have progressed on real things,” he said during an hour-long interview. Excerpts:
Interview with Indian Ambassador to Nepal, Manjeev Singh Puri at the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu, on Friday, December 13, 2019. Photo: Skanda Gautam/THT
Shall we begin with your experience as India’s Ambassador to Nepal?
It is only in Nepal that this could have happened, that I had the opportunity to be able to actualise both myself and my profession. Profession, yes, I could have had the opportunity in any other country. But, perhaps, Nepal is the only place which allowed me, as a Sikh, to be able to actualise myself. And this is the uniqueness of Nepal and India, and our relations at the level of people. We are marking 550 years or Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion. And it had to be that in Nepal we discovered his footsteps. We hope we will be able to take this ahead. And then we were able to discover societal connections between Sikhs and people of Nepal, not of the last 20-30 years, but over the last 150 years.
There’s a small Sikh community which is Nepali. And the reciprocation of your government and its understanding, issuing commemorative coins, legal tender, could happen only in Nepal. And that’s why I say this can only be an assignment that I will always cherish, remember, treasure because it allowed actualisation of both myself and my profession. Thank you very much, Nepal.
How have things changed vis-à-vis Nepal-India relations during your tenure?
I am very happy about one or two things particularly. We have been able to significantly take forward India-Nepal partnership. For many years the area of hydropower was kind of stuck in discussions. The two prime ministers laid the foundation stone of Arun III project, and the project is under construction. To me, this is a significant move to actually unleash the potential of Nepal in its economy, and India and Nepal in its partnership. The oil pipeline was under discussion for a long time. We started its construction in April 2018, and completed the project some eight or nine months ahead of schedule. I felt very happy on the day of the joint inauguration, which was done remotely, when Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli announced that there would be a two-rupee reduction at the pump for everyone. The idea of partnership is mutual benefit, and here you see it happening straight away at the grassroots level. Integrated check post projects have come forward. So I am happy that actually in my time here in Nepal, we have progressed on real things.
I am happy that during my stay here, the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi came twice to Nepal. He was accorded a huge welcome in Janakpur. Prime Minister Oli was himself there at Janaki Mandir, followed by the functions here in Kathmandu. And then Prime Minister Modi went to Muktinath. It has brought about different types of openings in the very old relations but we are making them relevant in the contemporary world and taking things forward. Prime Minister Oli went to India twice. The first was a state visit and it was very fruitful and complete. It saw the inauguration of the pipeline, the start of the construction of the pipeline, the inauguration of the integrated check posts and three major ideas, namely, the inland waterways linkage, the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway line, and development of agriculture.
The second time was for inauguration and swearing in ceremony of Prime Minister Modi. It was a short visit. I look at all of this and I have a sense of satisfaction that during my time here in Kathmandu things have really improved.
One other dimension, which is truly a people’s dimension, is the huge development of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra via Nepal. The routes via Nepal are the easiest — whether through Simikot-Hilsha, or through Rasuwagadi or even direct flights from here. The route from Simikot and Hilsha are hugely through Nepal, and are of mutual benefit to both sides. So I was happy to see, for example, Nepalgunj being able to harness the business opportunity. I have been to Simikot three or four times. And every time I’ve gone there, I am struck by the changing development landscape there. For example, when we went there the first time, there were hardly a few guest houses, and now they say there are homestays that can accommodate 400 people. Look at the changes that are happening, and changes taking place directly at the level of the people. So I have a sense of satisfaction.
Any noteworthy achievements that Nepal has made in the past couple of years?
I came here in 2017. It was a historic year for Nepal. You carried out three tiers of elections — smooth, quite friendly elections, barring one or two incidents, and carried out within a fairly tight schedule of a year. Indeed, provinces got formed, and there were assemblies elected for the first time in the history of Nepal. A much smaller Parliament than the Constituent Assembly got created. So I would suppose that Nepal also was in a sense celebrating multi-party democracy. India is a multi-party democracy. The celebration of multi-party democracy is always such a nice thing. Time was propitious; it went well; win-win possible; and I hope that we built on these.
The road ahead?
Both India and Nepal are developing countries. Yes, India is a nearly three-trillion-dollar economy. But you know you have set for yourself the target of becoming a middle income country in just 10 years. It’s a tall order. Prosperity and happiness are integral to what you want to achieve. We want to grow economically, we want to have better life for our people, this is something that fits completely with what we are doing in India for ourselves — a better quality of life for our people and ensuring that no one’s left behind and life improves for everyone. Of course, for that the cake has to enlarge.
Border management has been a complex issue. What could be the way ahead?
We are two countries, civilizations, peoples with such a long open border. And we have inherited this in legacy. There are many things which go in fact to time before these kinds of technologies came into being. There have been some interesting developments and we must take them forward. We have moved from older principles of water shared riverine geographical placements to fixed points and we did it. This is one of the most complex issues that can happen in border management and we did it. We did it as people, we did it as governments, and we did it as officials of governments. So we have the capability to do. And I believe we have the capacity and capability to address all these issues in a manner that there’s a kind of acceptance and satisfaction. We are a huge open border—1,800 km. People are going across. They have relationships and economic interests. They have societal links here and there. I have no doubt in my mind that each of these issues will be sorted out in a calm and normal manner.
How do you think will issues related to Kalapani, Susta and Limpiyadhura affect Nepal-India relations in the days to come?
I want to say something very clearly. There has been no change as far as India’s external boundary is concerned. You know that, I know that, we all know this. Now, sentiments are being expressed. We are listening to them. We know about them. Initiation of action for there to be some discussion has been initiated. And there will be actions on this particular thing. We are constantly having issues of very serious nature on, let’s say, trade, on issues of movement of goods and services. But we sat down and resolved them. There has to be certain kind of discussions but these particular discussions also require that you work in all of this in a manner to try and find a resolution. And we need to go about it looking at the facts, looking at the various things in the way they are. But as I mentioned to you, there has been no change in India’s external boundary. And I think we should be a little wary of giving opportunities to others to interplay in this. This is a legacy issue which has been long pending and it needs to be resolved amicably.
Indian Investment in Nepal used to be the largest, but has been on the decline lately?
Cumulatively, Indian investment in Nepal is by far the largest even in the last few years. In real inflows into Nepal, India has been No 1, absolutely no doubt about that. In fact, last year,  about 45 per cent of all inward movement into Nepal was from India. When companies in India became slightly big, and had the ambition of travelling overseas, the first point that they wanted to establish themselves was in Nepal. And that is how you see so many of these things. Whether it’s the Daburs or the Tatas or anybody else, that’s how these things happened. I now find that the Indian corporates, when they grow up, they evaluate Nepal, but there is no automaticity in wanting to invest.
Foreign Direct Investment is a competitive business for everyone. India’s economy has opened to the world. We are allowing FDI flows virtually into every sector. This also allows our companies to invest overseas all over the world today. So today, the fact that you are our closest neighbour, the fact that we know each other very well, the fact that we have personal friendships, the fact that our economies are intertwined, play a role for Indian corporate decisions on FDI, but only up to that point. They have the world open. So you have to also ensure that you are a competitive market for FDI investments.
Talking about specific cases, I say there’s no investment to compete or compare with Arun III — the sheer size and volume of the investment. And even now, in every sector here, the players, the people interested, are invariably the people from India usually with their friends and their partners in Nepal. And very large number of players in Nepal have partners in India. The global economy is very competitive. We have seen India-Nepal trade grow, even in the last few years. And it is a matter of happiness that Nepal’s exports to India are rising. We encourage Indian companies to invest in Nepal, and Nepalese companies to invest in India.
How do Indian companies look at Nepal as a competitive market for FDI?
Indian companies are enjoying the benefits of a hugely growing market domestically. Secondly, gone are the days when there were constraints about going overseas as a result of foreign exchange availability. Today the world is a mobile place. They invest, whether they go to the Middle East, Singapore, Australia, the United States, European counties or China. Indian companies, in a sense, are coming of age. What this means is you have to sharpen your attractiveness for FDI. And I am happy that the government is working on some sectors. But you know this has to remain a very important element of engagement. Nepal’s market is not small and not hugely large either. By European standards, Nepal is a reasonably big country. But if one looks at the globe, one looks at the totality of the market, how it can be serviced, and you come to the conclusion that the Nepalese market has to work to make itself attractive for big Indian players to come. Now, big companies are investing here even in assembly of motorcycles, two-wheelers. An Indian company which is a global player in the area of animal vaccines has joined hands with a Nepali partner and set up a plant here to export animal vaccines not to India, but globally. It’s a fantastic success story.
How do we resolve non-tariff barriers and quarantine-related issues that crop up time and again?
We have to work to try and solve these things. One of the things that we, as two governments, have done is the integrated check posts. Once these integrated check posts come in, with their own facilities, quarantines, laboratory testing, we should be able to ease the flow of goods. Working through far more efficient, far more modern system, we should be able to do it. We are working on that. We are also working on things such as recognising each other’s laboratories. These are also things which need a certain amount of working on because you have to exchange and understand each other’s protocols, the scientific community and the technological community have to come on board, and so on and so forth. I am glad that we are working on that. I think integrated check post is a good idea. It should be able to smoothen the flow of goods by bringing everything under one roof. We have got one done at Birgunj-Raxaul and the other one is ready at Jogbani-Biratnagar. It should be inaugurated very soon. Next step, we go towards Nepalgunj, Bhairahawa. This will ease the flow of doing business. And I think it will do two things — it will benefit consumers and result in boosting trade.
Nepal needs to create jobs, and that requires investment. How do we go about it?
Nepal is a very important country for India, not only in terms of our societal interaction, but also in terms of our economic interaction. We are two societies and two economies intertwined with each other. Creating jobs is one of the most important things we are doing in India. In fact, working on job creation, we have worked very hard on skill development, on start-ups, on all kinds of sunrise things. All these experiences are there for Nepal to share.
Investments are private sector decisions. As far as government companies are concerned, I’ve already mentioned Arun III. If there are bigger projects, you ask me, I believe we can go ahead with Pancheswor. It will be a game-changing project as far as Nepal is concerned. When I say Nepal, I mean the Nepalese economy is concerned. I am not only talking in terms of hydroelectric power production, but, in terms of the Nepalese economy, it will be a game-changing project. We have vested interest in your prosperity.
Some thoughts that you may like to leave for Nepal and Nepalis as you wrap things up?
We are seeing generational change both in India and Nepal. Younger people are coming to the fore and we are seeing globalisation in both our countries — so a new India and a new Nepal. I believe that both these societies, economies and polities will be greatly benefited by enhancing cooperation. Now, we are a two-and-half-trillion economy going to five, there are some facets of this geography which are known to everybody. You know India best as compared to almost any other country in the world. Let us not forget the direction of geography. And the direction of geography for both India and Nepal is to be together and to work together.
It’s not for me to suggest or recommend anything to a sovereign country or the sovereign people. But as a friend if you ask me, Nepal should recognise its achievements. You are a great country. Work on democracy and harness the geography around you. Take advantage of it. It will bring about a sea change in the quality of life and the economic situation as far as Nepal is concerned. I am very happy that you’ve focused on prosperity and happiness and to become a middle-income country. For me, the suggestion that I would leave is the easiest and directionally the best geography for you is India. We should work together.

The establishment faction of the Nepali Congress called a meeting of the party’s central working committee today but the rival faction led by senior leader Ramchandra Paudel boycotted the meeting over non-preparation of calendar of events for the 14th National Convention of the party.
The establishment faction postponed the CWC meeting till 1:00pm tomorrow after a brief meeting today. The Paudel faction has said that it will not attend any party meeting unless the establishment faction prepares calendar for the next national convention of the party.
NC Vice-president Bimalendra Nidhi, who is close to party President Sher Bahadur Deuba, said both sides were close to an agreement on the calendar of events for the next national convention but things had yet to be finalised.
“Today we could not discuss issues in detail as Ramchandra Paudel was out of town,” Nidhi said. Paudel went to Biratnagar yesterday.
NC lawmaker Dilendra Prasad Badu, who is close to Paudel, said Nidhi today met party General Secretary Shashank Koirala and told him that Deuba was ready to prepare the calendar for the national convention in the next CWC meeting.
“The establishment faction told us that they were going to discuss some issues related to party organsiation today but we had told the establishment faction that we would discuss all issues together if the calendar for the national convention was prepared,” Badu said.
He added that calendar for the national convention was the most urgent issue for the party at this stage. Deuba had met Paudel yesterday to convince him that increasing the number of party departments and appointments in those departments were more urgent than preparing calendar for the national convention, but Paudel refused to buy his argument.
The Paudel faction sees the establishment faction’s bid to increase the number of party departments as a ploy to delay the preparation of calendar of events for the national convention. Deuba had proposed to increase the number of party departments to 41 from the existing 28.
The tenure of NC leadership ends in March.
“Nidhi briefed Shashank Koirala about the developments. That means the establishment faction is ready to prepare the calendar for the national convention. I hope that the party leadership is working on the calendar of events,” Badu said.
The Paudel faction had boycotted the CWC meeting on Thursday as well over the delay in preparing the calendar of events for the next national convention.

257,https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/nepal-seeks-review-of-gurkha-recruitment-deal-with-britain-2/,"
KATHMANDU: Nepal wants to review a military deal allowing its citizens to be enlisted in the British army, before a planned recruitment of Nepali women in the Brigade of Gurkhas for the first time in two centuries, the Himalayan country’s foreign minister said.
It is not clear how many Gurkha women Britain plans to enlist, but the first Gurkha women could begin their training in the British army in 2020, according to British media.
Britain has been enlisting Gurkhas, a tribe from Nepal‘s Himalayan foothills known for their fierce combat abilities, since 1815.
An agreement between New Delhi, London and Kathmandu following India’s independence from colonial rule in 1947 allowed India and Britain to share and recruit Gurkhas.
In 2007, Britain announced plans to recruit Gurkha women for its elite force, adding however that issues such as recruitment and selection standards needed to be settled.
Nepal now wants the 72-year-old tripartite deal renegotiated since that accord does not allow Kathmandu to play any role in the recruitment process of Gurkhas by foreign armies, the country’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali told Reuters in an interview late on Friday.
“(Some) provisions of that agreement have become irrelevant now. Therefore, we have told Britain that we should review it … make bilateral arrangements,” said Gyawali.
“We should define the presence of the government of Nepal in the (recruitment) process.”
A new agreement should also address Gurkha grievances such as pensions and other benefits, which retired servicemen say are not at par with their British counterparts, Gyawali added.
Nepal, a natural buffer between China and India, is one of the world’s 10 poorest countries and remittances from Nepalis working abroad, including the Gurkhas, account for more than a quarter of its GDP.
Currently, there are about 3,000 Nepalis in the Brigade of Gurkhas who have fought in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans.

Senior leader of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) Madhav Kumar Nepal pointed out the need for the government to improve its performance.
Speaking to journalists at Biratnagar Airport today, senior leader Nepal said the government could not stay mum over questions raised by the public regarding  its dismal performance. “The government must address the concerns that people have been raising,” said the leader.
Nepal rejected that the results of the by-election were disheartening for the party. “The party has lost a few seats that were won in the past. The main reason behind it was the poor performance of local bodies and error in the selection of candidates,” Nepal said.
Nepal seemed positive about the power sharing deal between the two chairpersons of his party.
Regarding the recent Kalapani and Lipulek border dispute, he hoped that the issue would be resolved through talks between Nepal and India. “As Nepal has handed in a report to the Indian government that contains evidence showing Kalapani and Lipulek as our territories, I hope the issue will be resolved through dialogue,” said Nepal, adding that the idea of dragging India to the international court was unwise, given its possible adverse impact on relations between the two neighbours.

It will also be simultaneously inaugurated from all seven provinces. Visit Nepal Year 2020 is a national campaign to promote tourism in a bid to ensure the country’s economic prosperity.

According to Minister Bhattarai, the ministry has invited dignitaries, including tourism ministers from 40 countries at the inauguration. The government aims to attract two million visitors during the Visit Nepal Year.

He also claimed that the 13th SAG had been a grand success in terms of management, infrastructure and players’ performance. He said success of the 13th SAG was an example that Nepal was capable of organising any kind of international event.

He said most of the representatives of sporting bodies were well aware about Visit Nepal Year and they pledged their support to the event.
He said the officials of National Sports Council and Nepal Olympic Committee had also informed sports officials of participating countries about the Visit Nepal Year. Similarly, Prime Minster KP Sharma Oli’s concluding remarks during the closing ceremony of SAG had also helped promote Visit Nepal Year. Taking about preparations for Visit Nepal Year, Bhattarai said, “Now we will move ahead with the slogan ‘A Decade for Tourism’ in Nepal and formulate plans accordingly.”
“Visit Nepal Year will kick off outside the country from 7 January 2020.

According to Lakpa Sherpa, a local of Gumdel’s Lahachhewar, snowfall accompanied by rain has confined people to their homes. “With snowfall, cold has sharply increased and mostly the children have been hit hard as many of them are suffering from common cold and fever,” said Sherpa.
Gaushwara’s Tej Bahadur Magar said there was heavy snowfall in Gaushwara’s Shailung area and people were having hard time
carrying out business activities. Roads to Mude and Kholakharka have also been blocked due to the snowfall.

Heavy snowfall also occurred in Sankhuwasabha’s northern and southern belts. While over four local bodies have been affected by rain and snowfall since early afternoon, inclement weather has made vehicular movement difficult along Nundhaki’s Gufapokhari road
section. According to locals, snow has piled up to two to five feet in places such as Jaljala, Nundhaki, Makalu, Pawakhola, Hatiya, Kimanthanka and Chepuwa. “Snowfall occurred all of sudden. We’re unable to come out of our houses due to snowfall and the attendant chill,” said Hima Khanal, a local of Guphapokhari, which lies in Nundhaki. “There is snow everywhere and vehicular movement has been obstructed as the roads are covered,” she added.
Meanwhile, extreme weather condition caused by snowfall and rain has disrupted the Bhimdatta Highway that links hilly districts in Sudurpashchim Province.

Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, accompanied by Vice-president Bimalendra Nidhi today reached out to senior party leader Ramchandra Paudel in a bid to convince him that increasing the party’s departments and making appointments in them was more urgent than finalising the calendar of events for the party’s next national convention, but  Paudel refused to budge on his stance.
Deuba’s move follows the Paudel faction’s boycott of the NC Central Working Committee meeting on Thursday over delay in preparing the calendar of events for the next national convention. Paudel’s faction has threatened to boycott the CWC meeting scheduled for tomorrow if the calendar for the national convention is not included in the agenda. Paudel told THT he would not attend any party meetings, including the CWC meeting tomorrow, if Deuba did not agree to prepare the calendar of events for the national convention.
“Deuba’s attempt to increase the number of party departments and appoint people in them is to appease loyalists and delay the national convention,” Paudel said, adding, “Why is there need to increase the party’s departments when the more urgent agenda is to hold our party’s national convention?”
The tenure of the current NC leadership ends in March next year.
Paudel told Deuba a taskforce led by Prakash Man Singh would finalise the number of departments and this taskforce would work at its own pace. “I have hinted that I will not tolerate his unilateral actions,” Paudel said and added it was urgent to prepare calendar of events for the national convention as it could take one-and-a-half years to conduct the national convention as per the new statute of the party. “I had prepared a tentative calendar of events in February, but Deuba did not accept it,” he added.
Paudel said Deuba had assured that he would bring the calendar of events before mid-November, but he did not do so even by mid-December. “This shows Deuba is buying time.” Paudel warned Deuba that if the national convention was pushed further, the party would find itself in crisis. He said Deuba’s action was not transparent and aimed at appeasing loyalists.
NC Vice-president Nidhi said Deuba sought Paudel’s help to form the party’s departments and sister wings, particularly Nepal Students Union and Tarun Dal. According to Nidhi, Deuba told Paudel he was committed to preparing the calendar for national convention once the interim structures of the party were prepared for all levels.
Later in the evening, Nidhi held talks with Paudel faction. It was also attended by Paudel faction members Dilendra Prasad Badu and Hriday Ram Thani. Badu said his faction told Nidhi that if the calendar was not discussed, his faction would continue to boycott the CWC meetings.
Sources said Deuba would consult other party leaders before deciding on the Paudel faction’s demand. The Paudel camp is also against Deuba’s proposal to increase the number of party departments to 41 from the existing 28.

Janakpurdham, Dec 14
Three persons, including a police inspector were killed and four others were injured in a bomb explosion at Mahendranagar of Chhireswornath Municipality-5, Dhanusha, last night.
Superintendent of Police Shekhar Khanal at Dhanusha District Police Office said a pressure cooker bomb planted at the second main gate of local Rajesh Sah’s house went off at midnight. The improvised explosive device was kept inside a red bag.
House owner Rajesh, 42, his son Anant Sah, 17, and Inspector Amir Dahal of Sakhuwa Mahendranagar Area Police Office lost their lives in the incident. Rajesh and Anant died on the spot while Inspector Dahal died while being rushed to Dharan for treatment, said SP Khanal. Post-mortem of the bodies was conducted at Janakpur Zonal Hospital.
Rajesh’s father Bhikhari Sah, daughter Anjali Sah, youngest son Prakash Sah and policeman Rijan Mahato were injured in the incident. Bhikhari Sah is being treated at Janakpur Zonal Hospital while three others who are critically injured are undergoing treatment at BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan.
According to SP Khanal, the bomb was planted at the handle of the second main gate in a red bag. “An unidentified person had informed Rajesh about the IED over phone,” SP Khanal said. After that, all the family members had evacuated the house through another gate and stayed 300 metres away at the house of Rajesh’s brother Raj Kumar Sah. Raj Kumar is employed in Malaysia.
After he reached his brother’s house, Rajesh had called Mahendranagar Area Police Office and reported about the bomb. A police team led by Inspector Dahal had reached the incident site. The police team was accompanied by Rajesh’s family to the site.
Eyewitnesses said Inspector Dahal had noticed the pressure cooker bomb but he might have thought the object was a dummy
kept to scare Rajesh’s family. He touched the bomb with a stick causing the IED to explode. They said the incident took place due to negligence on the part of Inspector Dahal.
The deceased Anant and his injured brother Prakash are tenth and eighth graders at Siddhartha Boarding School in Janakpur. Anjali is  preparing for Public Service Commission examinations.
The explosion caused cracks in the wall and bomb shrapnels caused holes in the house walls.
Rajesh was running Nikki Pharmacy at his home. Besides, he was involved in lending money at high interest rate. According to some locals, Rajesh used to lend money at up to 36 per cent interest rate. His loan transactions covered many settlements of Chhireswor Municipality. Locals surmised that the incident might have to do with the loan and high interest rate charged by Rajesh.
Police have arrested Sitadevi Mahara, Lalita Mahara, Ramsovit Gaha of Dhanusha’s Hansapur Municipality suspecting their involvement in the incident. Sitadevi is the Netra Bikram Chand-led Communist Party of Nepal Province 2 coordinator and the other two are central members of the party, said SP Khanal.
The three arrested have been kept in custody.
A seven-member police team led by Inspector Umashankar Sah has been formed to probe the incident, police said.
The CPN, however, has not commented on the incident. Meanwhile, Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal Dhanusha Constituency 4 claimed that the injured Bhikhari was the party’s cadre and demanded that the guilty be punished.
To protest the incident, Chhireswornath chapter of Commerce and Industry has called market shutdown tomorrow.
Meanwhile, Minister  of Home Affairs Ram Bahadur Thapa said the government would take action to bring to book the culprits. “This is a barbaric and inhuman act. I, on behalf for the government, vow to act tough against the persons behind the crime,” he wrote on his Facebook post.

KATHMANDU: Nepal wants to review a military deal allowing its citizens to be enlisted in the British army, before a planned recruitment of Nepali women in the Brigade of Gurkhas for the first time in two centuries, the Himalayan country’s foreign minister said.
It is not clear how many Gurkha women Britain plans to enlist, but the first Gurkha women could begin their training in the British army in 2020, according to British media.
Britain has been enlisting Gurkhas, a tribe from Nepal’s Himalayan foothills known for their fierce combat abilities, since 1815.
An agreement between New Delhi, London and Kathmandu following India’s independence from colonial rule in 1947 allowed India and Britain to share and recruit Gurkhas.
In 2007, Britain announced plans to recruit Gurkha women for its elite force, adding however that issues such as recruitment and selection standards needed to be settled.
Nepal now wants the 72-year-old tripartite deal renegotiated since that accord does not allow Kathmandu to play any role in the recruitment process of Gurkhas by foreign armies, the country’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali told Reuters in an interview late on Friday.
“(Some) provisions of that agreement have become irrelevant now. Therefore, we have told Britain that we should review it … make bilateral arrangements,” said Gyawali.
“We should define the presence of the government of Nepal in the (recruitment) process.”
A new agreement should also address Gurkha grievances such as pensions and other benefits, which retired servicemen say are not at par with their British counterparts, Gyawali added.
Nepal, a natural buffer between China and India, is one of the world’s 10 poorest countries and remittances from Nepalis working abroad, including the Gurkhas, account for more than a quarter of its GDP.
Currently, there are about 3,000 Nepalis in the Brigade of Gurkhas who have fought in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans.

Currently, Shantinagar, Dangisharan, Rapti and Gadhwa rural municipalities have been running the programme, while it was implemented in Babai, Banglachuli and Rajpur rural municipalities last year, according to Provincial Assembly member Rewati Raman Sharma.
Every rural municipality has got Rs 5.2 million for carrying out development work that focus on the upliftment of the Dalit, women, minorities and backward communities.
“Smart village project will be launched in the district this year,” added Sharma. According to him, villages deprived of electricity would be provided solar energy on 90 per cent grant. The provincial government will provide the grant. There is a plan to ensure pure drinking water to every household within three years. Quality education, health and income generating skills are other priorities for the communities that are backward in economic and social indicators, according to Sharma.

The camp was organised by Nepal Netra Jyoti Association Eye and Ear Treatment Centre Bhojpur with the technical assistance of Biratnagar Eye Hospital.
Some 57 eye patients are said to have undergone surgery in the camp till yesterday. According to Eye Hospital Bhojpur, mostly children are found suffering from eye problems these days, which is often attributed to the excessive use of mobile and the Internet use.
“Besides children, eye problems have been seen in large number of people even in rural areas, where there is very little awareness on safety of eyes,” said Dr Bijaya Tamang. According to data with the eye hospital, some 2187, 2386 and 2527 eye patients visited the hospital in fiscal 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19, respectively.
Most of the patients were elderly and children.

276,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-bring-culprits-to-book/,"It is best the police stay away from situations they were not trained for and allow competent agencies to handle them
Three persons, including a police inspector, were killed in a bomb explosion in Chhireswornath Municipality in Dhanusha district Friday night, an incident that could have been largely avoided if only common sense had prevailed. According to reports, the police inspector, Amir Dahal, had set off the pressure cooker bomb planted at the gate of the house belonging to a local, Rajesh Sah, with a stick instead of waiting for a bomb disposal unit of the Nepal Army to arrive on the scene. There are speculations that the inspector might have thought the bomb hanging from the door handle was a hoax, but his foolhardiness not only took the lives of the house owner and his son but also injured three other members of Sah’s family and a policeman. The father and son duo had died on the spot while the inspector died on the way to hospital. What is particularly sad is that the very person who had called the police to report about the bomb should die in the explosion. There is little doubt that carelessness on the part of Inspector Dahal led to the tragic accident.
As per reports, an unidentified person had informed Rajesh about the IED (improvised explosive device) by telephone, but it is not known who could possibly have planted it in his house. But the police have made some arrests on suspicion that the IED might have been planted by cadres of the outlawed Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), led by Netra Bikram Chand. The party’s cadres have been involved in such nefarious activities in the past – setting off bombs in communication giant Ncell’s offices and towers and in extorting money from teachers and civil servants in the countryside – but the CPN has not owned up to the incident. The deceased, Rajesh, owned a pharmacy and is said to have been lending money to locals at exorbitant interest rates, of upto 36 per cent. Could this have been a reason for targeting Rajesh? Whatever the reason, planting a bomb in someone’s house with the intention of destroying life and property, if need be, is a condemnable act.
The Dhanusha incident should be an eye opener to the police force about how not to deal with sensitive safety matters. Many a times, police folly or highhandedness has only aggravated a situation, as was the case last week in Kohalpur in mid-west Nepal, after a truck hit an 11-year-old girl about to enter school, crushing both her legs. The police need better training to enhance their skills in dealing with different circumstances. It is best they stay away from situations they were not trained for – in this case disposal of bombs – and allow competent agencies to handle them. Minister for Home Affairs Ram Bahadur Thapa has vowed to act tough and bring the culprits involved in planting the bomb to book. The people will be watching how soon he does this. Although there has been an improvement in the law and order situation over the years with the writing of the new constitution in 2015, there are some political groups that have refused to join mainstream politics, instead resorting to intimidating tactics to push their agenda through. It is time the Home Ministry acted tough against them so that people feel safe and secure in the society.

Bicycle lanes
Cycling is a good exercise. An hour of cycling a day keeps a person physically fit and healthy. However, the Kathmandu Valley does not have dedicated lanes for cyclists along the major thoroughfares. During the local level elections, all the political parties had promised to make all the municipalities of the Valley bicycle-friendly. However, they have failed to keep their promises. Some sections of the city areas have seen declared bicycle-friendly, but they are unsafe for the bicycle users.
Marking the 25th anniversary of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) on Saturday, the city mayor, Bidhya Sundar Shakya, vowed to introduce cycle lanes in major parts of the city in the near future.
In 2014, the government had declared both sides of the Maitighar-Tinkune road segment as dedicated cycle lanes. But they are now used as footpaths. The KMC must coordinate with the Department of Roads (DoR) if it wants to develop cycle lanes in the city areas as DoR is the sole agency to take care of them. Once some sections of the roads are dedicated to cycle lanes, none else should be allowed to use them. The traffic police must make sure that the cycle lanes are used only by the cyclists, not by motorcyclists and others.

The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (GBV), an annual international campaign, came to an end on December 10. Amid the campaign, the world has witnessed many cases of GBV. Priyanka Reddy, a 26-year-old veterinary doctor in Hyderabad, India was gang raped and murdered, which sparked outrage across India and even the world. Similarly in Nepal, Parwati Budha Rawat was found dead while staying in a “menstruation hut” in Achham district, Sudurpaschim Province. Likewise, a few months ago, Aarti Chaudhary, had filed a complaint at the District Police Office in Dhanusha after her husband, Indrajit, and in-laws physically abused her for failing to bring enough dowry.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
One question regarding this issue is, why did the girl’s side not file a complaint against Indrajit when dowry was demanded in the initial phase? When someone files a case against demand for ‘enough dowry’, does it not indicate that dowry is legal? Dowry is related to the mindset of the people and is an anti-social practice.
The above incidents of GBV are only representative cases. However, violence against women is being endured even in the 21st century. Despite the feminist movement, GBV exists in Nepal and throughout the globe. In Nepal, in particular, such a scenario is related to the level of women’s empowerment and their level of domination in leadership positions. Since women’s presence in the state apparatuses is very low, GBV cases are not being handled aggressively.
There had been a political deadlock in Nepal for decades. After completion of three elections and the constitutional obligation in the aftermath in favour of gender and social inclusion, the political impasse has ended. Full participation of women in political life is not only a guarantee of their human rights, but also an essential requirement in building peaceful societies. The veteran human rights activist, Michelle Bachelet, once said, “When one woman is a leader, it changes her. When more women are leaders, it changes politics and policies.”
Regarding the status of Nepali women’s representation, there is a need to shed some light on it. Nepali women’s representation in the legislative body was dramatically increased to 32.8 per cent through the Constituent Assembly (CA) election held in 2008. In the election, 191 women leaders (33.2 per cent) were elected out of 575 seats, and the Cabinet nominated six women out of 26 seats, resulting in 197 women members (32.8 per cent) in the legislative parliament. As a result, Nepal stands 14th globally in sending women leaders to the legislature parliament. The reason behind the dramatic change in women’s representation is the reservation of seats provided through the Interim Constitution of Nepal, 2007. This gradual constitutional obligation also gave the first woman president in Nepal.
With the first woman president, there is some hope that people will see positive change in terms of empowering women through education and developing their leadership capacity. Beyond its intrinsic value, greater gender equality in politics and public life will bring distinct orientations and behaviours to office. Indeed, among citizens and legislators, women and men often have different political interests and priorities, issue positions, party preferences and legislative behaviours. Although the mere presence of women in political positions does not guarantee any particular policy outcome, their greater representation in the legislature has been linked to increased legislative focus on health and family policy, more spending on social services and less on defense.
Currently the Federal Parliament has 32.7 per cent women. But very few women are seen vocal in raising concerns on national issues with rationality. So they need to be provided leadership training to sharpen their capacity. If we look at the political parties, constitutionally, all four parties—the Nepal Communist Party, Nepali Congress, Samajwadi Party Nepal and Rastriya Janta Party Nepal—are illegitimate in that they have failed to ensure the constitutionally-mandated minimum 33 per cent of women in the party structures. The status of women in the Nepali bureaucracy is just as pathetic.
In Nepal, due to the constitutional obligations, women have been able to hold political positions as mere representatives. But there is a vast difference between representation and leadership. The time has come to think why the representatives cannot be ‘leaders’. The feminist critique of patriarchy is founded on the arguments that all social structures and systems, and all political systems, are patriarchal. According to feminist arguments, the division of power between men and women that has persisted throughout human history systematically oppresses and disadvantages women. It operates throughout society, in politics, work, the family, legal and judicial systems.
Last but not the least, women should be posted at law enforcing positions. There is a need to eliminate the patriarchal mindset from society, only after which a level of change will be seen in the society. The anti dowry and chhaupadi law must be implemented brutally to discourage such anti-social practices.

278,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/the-under-utilised-resource/,"Many agencies, conventions and organisations are working to make gender an issue of priority. But is that enough? What about the patriarchal mindset of the people? Of course, more and more women are gradually participating in decision-making in society. Still women are an under-utilised resource.
I was privileged to attend school and pursue higher studies without having to fight for the minimum right to education. Still, there are a great number of women whose contribution to the different sectors is hardly recognised.
There are many women in Nepal who possess impressive qualifications. Parents these days invest in their daughter’s education unlike in the past when money was saved for her marriage. It is good to see women intellects with creative ideas and potential. But after marriage, they fail to add value to that qualification, as women are often asked not to work outside and remain within the private domain. The daughter-in-law has no role in decision-making even if it is about her career and her independence. Because of this, Nepal is losing out on potential thinkers, producers and innovators. Additionally, it also leads to diminishing self-respect and dignity of a woman.
The aspiration to work or accomplish one’s goals makes women self-confident, independent and secure. Anyone would be content and proud if the skills and potential are recognised and utilised. Unfortunately, there still exists the notion that an ideal daughter-in-law is supposed to be a home-maker while it is the husband’s responsibility to earn the living for his family and to maintain the family dignity.
Every human being evolves according to society, and yes, when you are part of it you have to be responsible. But does that mean compromising on one’s self-respect and dignity? There is always criticism and rigidity when you first try to step up against the conservative patriarchal traditions. Without change there is no scope for development. With time, society, traditions and culture change gradually, which leads to evolution and development. A change in perspective requires a radical shift in the core beliefs, but it is very difficult to change these core beliefs. Hence, women themselves must transform their mindset in the first place so as to start looking at the problem differently.
As a quote goes, “If you don’t like being a doormat then get off the floor.”

279,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-online-lottery-scam/,"People should stay away from online lottery schemes, while banks must overhaul their software system as per the NRB directives
With the advancement in information technology and easy access to the Internet, smart mobile phones and social networking sites, transnational rackets are misusing them to dupe unsuspecting Nepalis in the guise of online lottery. This is a recent phenomenon, making it difficult for the law enforcement agency to deal with such a racket. No sooner had an international racket stolen millions of rupees from the Lahan-based branch of Nepal Agriculture Development Bank by feeding malware into its computer system and Panos Remit in the capital a few months ago than another racket, in connivance with Nepali accomplices, has duped 34 people of Rs 146.7 million through banking channels. Police have arrested three Nepali members of an organised international racket for duping people of millions of rupees through an online lottery scam and hacking the banking system to remit money abroad. According to the Metropolitan Police Crime Division (MPCD), Nigerian, British and Indian nationals were operating their racket using their Nepali agents from outside the country to swindle gullible users of such a huge amount of money through online lottery and on the pretext of sending valuable parcels via social media. It has come to light that a Nigerian national and a Briton are the ringleaders.
The police have learnt about the existence of 14 bank accounts held by Nepali agents, who duped unwary people through the online lottery scam. Fifteen of those duped have already lodged complaints with the MPCD. They had deposited cash in the said bank accounts when asked to do so by the scammers. The racketeers allowed the Nepali agents to keep 15-20 per cent of the amount collected through the scams and hacking the banking system as commission for the work done. The agents would transfer the remaining amount to India via several channels, including hundi. Nepali agents were found to be operating more than six bank accounts each.
The way Nepal’s banking system has been hacked time and again over the last four years shows that something is wrong within it, which needs an overhaul to deal with the emerging threat. It would also be impossible to hack the banking system without some kind of hint or help from the employee(s) of the concerned banks. Nepal Rastra Bank had issued circulars to the banks to upgrade their software systems to make them foolproof. But they have failed to heed its directives. People will lose confidence in the banking system if such incidents continue unabated. Duping people of millions of rupees through online lottery scams is a serious case, which the law enforcement agency and the banks cannot take lightly. Most of those cheated by the international racketeers are from the rural areas, little educated, illiterate about information technology or unemployed, who want to earn easy money overnight. This could be the main reason why they fall prey to transnational rackets. One must be aware of the fact that nobody will offer cash or a lucrative prize to anyone for no reason. The only way to stay free from such scams is to avoid entertaining such messages and also to educate others about such acts.

New education policy
The government has introduced the National Education Policy-2019, which is structured in line with the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. While compulsory and free basic education is a salient feature of the new policy, it has given emphasis to science and technology in a bid to produce technical manpower at all levels.
Nepal’s education system was in need of a major overhaul, given the falling education standards at all levels, indiscipline and growing unemployment in the country. A good education policy if implemented well can help produce the necessary manpower in the country itself and save billions of rupees that go to train our human resource in foreign universities. At the heart of any education policy, however, lies the training of good teachers who can mould students into future nation builders. Unfortunately, Nepal’s education system has been marred by politics, both of the teachers and students. Unless the parties show the will to dismantle politics in education altogether, it is going to be an uphill task to realise the ideals of the new policy, namely that of producing educated, civilised, healthy and capable human resource and bringing prosperity to the nation.

Soon after Tootle and Pathao took over the transportation market in Nepal, the Department of Transport Management shared a notice announcing ride-sharing as illegal. Similarly, the government attempted to charge a high licensing fee when Wifi became mainstream in 2006. The driving force behind cases like these is the lack of research and reluctance in proactive policy making, which in turn discourages innovation and new technology. The illegality of ride sharing applications can be compared to how Bitcoin is now being banned in Nepal. On August 13, 2017, Nepal Rastra Bank issued a notice banning Bitcoin. Two acts: Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 2019 BS and Nepal Rastra Bank Act 2058 BS have been given as the reasons behind this ban. However, what is more baffling is that the ban has not been followed up by research, nor was the ban based on research. In both scenarios, policymaking is reactive and fearful of new changes rather than adapting itself to them.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Ever since the emergence of Bitcoin in 2009, it has started a global debate on cryptocurrency. A key question on this ongoing debate is: “Does cryptocurrency fall under the definition of money?” In theory, cryptocurrency follows all the rules of money, such as it being a medium of exchange. However, practically, Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will not replace local currencies (at least for the next ten years) as every country needs to establish their own monetary policy to manage factors such as inflation. Cryptocurrencies are not stable enough to make price comparisons and transactions. For example, it doesn’t make sense to pay $3 one day and pay $57 on another day for the same cup of coffee. Globally, many countries have defined cryptocurrency as an asset and is taxed accordingly.
As the technological world is intrigued by Bitcoin, they are equally fascinated by the promises of blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin.
Blockchain Foundation Nepal in support of World Vision International and Paluwa Pleaders organised a Blockchain Symposium 2019 in November. Five research papers were presented including the legality of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in Nepal, how Sustainable Development Goals can be addressed through blockchain, a survey to understand the mentality of Nepali towards blockchain and agile project management in blockchain.
While presenting on the legality of cryptocurrency, Shishir Subedi, a director of Paluwa Pleaders, stated that advocates from the government side and judges do not even know the basic concept of Bitcoin in order to make rational decisions in court. He was specifically referring to the case of involving Bitsewa, which is still ongoing in Kathmandu District Court. This has been one of the biggest hurdles for the Nepali technological advancement scene, where the lawmakers and practitioners are reluctant to do research, bring relevant experts and act proactively.
As digital and physical realities are merging to form a single integrated form of modern living, the argument that policymakers should be reactive and let the previous laws define the current innovation is obsolete. Santosh Shrestha, the co-founder of Rumsan Tech, says, “New technologies and innovation cry for new regulations and laws. But while we wait for regulations to catch up with the speed of development of these new technologies, people who use these technologies usually will need to “break” the old law.”
While the Electronic Transaction Act 2063 BS (2008) has not even defined online payment system properly, it is ambitious to relate this to address blockchain and cryptocurrency. However, we can introduce the minimum regulations scheme, which allows the innovation to flourish without disrupting the current order massively. We can curb on the trading part whereas being lenient on the development aspect.
Saujanya Acharya, project lead of ‘Sikka’, a digital asset transfer network that transfers digital credits to beneficiaries especially used for aid distribution, expressed his frustration at the ambiguity of these laws as Sikka had to back out from using Ethereum (uses cryptocurrency) because of the law of Nepal. They later switched from Ethereum to Hyperledger because there’s no crypto involved in hyperledger. A comparable example would be if vending machines give out cocaine, the vending machine itself should not be made illegal. The ambiguous regulations should not slow down the innovation process. In the current scenario, where majority of the policymakers and law practitioners are not aware of blockchain technology, providing legality to cryptocurrency may not seem like a wise move at a glance. But this cries for the need of bringing in experts to adapt and understand the need of a newer technology rather than outrightly avoiding it. In order to comply with the foreign currency regulations, as well as continue to encourage innovative technology in Nepal, we should develop our own national cryptocurrency backed by the Nepali rupee.
The lawmakers need to focus on progressive and proactive policymaking. The government needs to be open to adapting new technology, and they need to bring in outside experts to help them create laws – there should be a wider public debate about Bitcoin and ride sharing apps and other similar controversies, unless Nepal wants to continue living in the 20th century.

281,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/its-all-in-the-gut/,"It’s all in the gut is a commonplace precept. It narrates the possibility construct within and outside of our intuitive compass. This isn’t gawking at our star-signs—in simple terms, our gut is the contextual junction between us and our world. To picture a case in point — the earthworm scuttles ever so unobtrusively through the soil, ingesting a tiny part — a fraction of which travels through its pint-sized body and transforms into a casting.
This is a remarkable natural enterprise. It extracts and adds rich value to the soil. You and I network in much the same way, the variance being of degree.
The food we all eat is integrated into our tissues— the surplus is ousted. You get the point— our digestive tract corresponds to a temporary transit point for building blocks of energy, which may be used or stored for use. It reflects our temperament, too — including our larger personality that represents us. It showcases our own fertile ‘soil’, a complex web of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Such microorganisms, like everything that happens in our world, fight for territorial rights — including individual hegemony. They allude to the famed Darwinian maxim — survival of the fittest.
Our life is a complete stage-show; it is complex and mutually dependent. You cannot, for instance, stub out a species to benefit the other. This holds good for our gut, too. If we promote just fungal forms in our gut, it hampers the presence of good bacteria at the cost of our well-being.
Do you know that bacteria — good and bad — are absolutely essential for the proper functioning of our gut? Just think of it — our digestive function could go erratic in the absence of such microbes. This, in turn, could affect normal assimilation of food and its nutrients.
There is yet another dimension to our gut — that it is all-embracing, also ahead, of our ‘gut feelings’. When we don’t take good care of our gut, no food can make us feel cheerful. Our palate leisurely goes into a state of bad taste.
This muddles our sense of what is right, or may not agree with our gut. We may gradually tend to forget what our gut, the seat of observation, knows best — more so, when it has moved into a state of confusion. Our ancients were wise. They not only espoused the harmonious foundation of eating right — or eating with meditative simplicity — but also amplified their wellness quotient and conscious awareness, while leading a gutsy life.

282,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-ending-inequalities/,"Most of the countries in South Asia are way ahead of Nepal, making it more and more difficult to catch up with them
Nepal has improved its standing in the Human Development Index (HDI) 2019 by two spots compared to last year, but it is of little solace when juxtaposed with the other countries of South Asia. Nepal is now ranked at 147 out of 189 countries in the HDI, according to a report published by the United Nations Development Programme Tuesday. Nepal has been placed in the medium human development category, having acquired a HDI rating of 0.579 in 2018. In the region, only Pakistan and war-torn Afghanistan fall behind in the HDI. The review shows that Nepal has made progress in terms of every indicator. But this has not translated into better ranking for Nepal because other countries have performed much better. In South Asia, India, Bhutan and Bangladesh are way ahead – at 129, 134 and 135, making it more and more difficult for Nepal to catch up with them. As for Sri Lanka (71) and the Maldives (104), they have always fared very well in the HDI rankings.
The HDI assesses long-term progress in three basic dimensions of human development—a long and healthy life, education and a decent standard of living. As per the report, between 1990 and 2018, Nepal’s HDI value increased from 0.380 to 0.579, an increase of 52.6 per cent. Although Nepal’s life expectancy and expected years of schooling are relatively higher than the average score for South Asia, the country tends to lag behind in the mean years of education among the adult population and per capita income. Nepal’s life expectancy at birth is 70.5 years (69.7 years for south Asia) while the mean years of schooling is 4.9 years against 6.5 years for South Asia. As for gross national income (GNI) per capita, as per purchasing power parity, it stands at $2,748, trailing far behind the South Asian average of $6,794.  In fact, in terms of per capita income, Nepal is just ahead of Afghanistan ($1,746). Nepal’s 2018 HDI value is below the average of 0.634 for countries grouped in the medium human
development category and also below the average of 0.642 for countries in South Asia. Nepal literally lies on the edge of the medium human development group, and a major natural disaster, like the big earthquake witnessed in 2015, could push Nepal’s ranking really down.
The 2019 HDI has also explored inequalities in human development, not limiting itself to disparities in income and wealth, but going beyond income, beyond averages and beyond today. If Nepal’s HDI value of 0.579 is discounted for inequality in the distribution of the HDI dimension indices, then the value would come down to 0.430, a loss of 25.8 per cent. What inequalities in human development do is they give rise to frustration in society, destroying social cohesion and people’s trust in the government.
As the UNDP report notes, they make it harder for political decisions to reflect the aspirations of
the whole society and to protect our planet. The HDI report should be an eye opener for the government to introduce policies that will end inequalities in human development in the country instead of shaping decisions that serve the interest of a few. There are plenty of lessons to learn from Nepal’s neighbours on this score.

Compensate fairly
The government has not been able to set a principle of compensation for the land to be acquired for development projects. This is the reason why the local people often resort to bandhs demanding fair compensation for their land. This problem has once again surfaced in the proposed 1,200-MW Budhigandaki Hydel Project, being built in Dhading and Gorkha districts, because of the government’s unscientific approach in dealing with the locals when it comes to providing compensation for the land the project needs.
As the earlier compensation plan worked out by the local administration did not work, the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation and the locals have now reached a four-point deal in which the government will review the earlier compensation arrangement and make a master plan to relocate the project-affected people to the nearest areas. A national pride project, which helps give a boost to the national economy, should not make the locals poorer than they were after their relocation. A development project rather should help uplift the people’s condition of living. It is meaningless to build a project that displaces a large number of people from their ancestral areas with an uncertain future.

The arrangement related to distribution of fiscal resources is the mainstay of federal polity. In fact, no federal institution can function effectively unless adequate financial resources are provisioned. Principally, it is affirmed that economic stabilisation and income redistribution functions should be performed at the national level. But the functions related to provision of public goods and service delivery should be carried out at the sub-national level. According to Anwar Shah, renowned fiscal federalism expert, when governmental decisions are made closer to the citizenry rather than in the national capital, the public is likely to keep track of the decision about government services and taxes to finance them.

In fact, the way taxes and spending decisions is made and inter-governmental transfers are structured determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal governance system. However, in many countries, assignment of tax and expenditure between the national government and sub-national levels is not equitably instituted and established. And sub-national governments have at their disposal diminished volume of resources that do not match their needs and requirements. In several cases, local governments are endowed with enlarged and broad-based set of unfunded functions. As a consequence, they cannot discharge their functions and responsibilities in an effective way.
Article 228 of the constitution mentions about the taxing authority of the local government. It provides that the local governments can generate their income through taxes and loans from fiscal institutions subject to the provision of the law. The provision further empowers the local government to levy tax on the subjects of competencies as prescribed without having an adverse effect on the national fiscal policy, free movement of goods and services, capital and labour market and fiscal policies of the neighbouring provinces.
Article 229 of the constitution provides for a consolidated fund in the Gaunpalika (village government) and Nagarpalika (municipal government). In the consolidated fund, all income receipts like grant transfers from the federal and provincial government, own source of revenue, loans and income from other sources should be deposited. The expenditures from the consolidated fund should be allocated according to the procedure prescribed by the local government law. There are three major sources of revenue of the local government, which are their own tax sources, shared taxes and revenues, and inter-governmental transfers.
A local government budget is a document that makes disclosures of the anticipated income for
the financial year from each income source, plan and non-plan expenditures, and actual income and expenditure for the financial year before the current budget year. Like all government budgets, local government budgets consist of two sides, namely an operating/recurring budget, which covers the running cost, and capital cost, which covers the cost for infrastructure development and purchasing new equipment. Local governments are not generally allowed to plan deficit financing unless they have a definite source of income that compensates for the deficit and shortfalls.
Most importantly, the constitution provides for the creation of a National Fiscal and Natural Resource Commission to devise a methodology and mechanism for distribution of financial resources and natural resources among the three levels of the government. The commission determines the system and structure of intergovernmental fiscal relations.
Article 251 of the constitution enumerates a list of roles and functions of the commission. The major functions, as stipulated in the constitution and the act, include review of the finances of the government in accordance with the functional responsibilities; prepare an elaborate basis and design for sharing the revenue of the divisible pool in the federal consolidated fund; recommend a formula and process for sharing and distribution of equalisation grants to the provinces and local government; create the basis for sharing the tied and conditional grants among the provinces and local governments though proper evaluation on the basis of national policies and programmes.
The commission is also mandated to analyse the overall economic indicators to recommend the upper limit on internal borrowing for the federal, provincial and local government and review the basis of revenue sharing and suggest measures for improvement. The commission works out the modality for the distribution of natural resources and suggests ways and means to resolve disputes arising out of natural resources benefit sharing and distribution between the federal and provinces, among the provinces, provinces and local governments, and among the local governments.
The commission has thus extensive roles and responsibilities. However, the commission is yet to be fully constituted and made competent enough to function effectively. The chief of the commission has been appointed, but other members are yet to be filled in. It rests on the commission to ensure that the country’s fiscal governance is set on the right track to warrant that the multi-level federation, envisaged according to the new constitutional arrangement, delivers effectively.

284,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/beauty-hurts/,"When I was a child, I was given children’s books, especially Barbie storybooks. Some of them were colouring books where I could colour the dresses of the princess and prince as I fancied while others were mostly storybooks, which showed how the prince and the princess met and eventually got married happily ever after.
Nepali children books were similar in nature, especially the ones that had stories of a prince and princess. My parents used to buy me Barbie dolls as I was obsessed with them. I would look at them and wonder when I would ever be like them – flawless and beautiful.
As I grew up, my teachers, friends and people around me became the role model regarding beauty. I was in grade seven, and one of the teachers used to wear pretty sandals, and when she walked they made a noise. I began walking heavily too so that my shoes or sandals would make a noise. I saw that she used to match her nail polish with the colour of her clothes, and so I decided to match the colour of my earrings and hairband with that of my clothes.
When I entered adolescence, I was obsessed with the idea of looking pretty. Now my role models were actresses. I used to look at them and just be in awe. After high school, I got my first phone, and I remember taking hundreds of selfies. Soon beauty cameras came into vogue, even cameras where there were makeup filters.
So even if you didn’t wear any makeup, the app would put makeup on you. I would look at my flawless pictures and feel happy that I looked pretty. Not only that, the idea of being slim and having a zero figure became popular. I used to see actresses with hourglass figures and would exercise day and night to look like them.
All this time, I never took a moment to think why I was doing what I was doing. Why did looking beautiful become so important to me? Why was I wasting my time trying to be someone I was not? Due to heavy exercise, I began getting stretch marks on my body. I wanted my skin to look flawless and hence avoided oily foods and spices and would even cut down on my rice portions. I pushed myself to the limit, and my body started becoming weak.
I then saw one of my favourite makeup artists without any makeup on social media. I was shocked by the freckles she had. I then began thinking how delusive this world is. I began thinking how becoming beautiful hurts, not only to me but to thousands of girls out there.

285,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-sag-and-beyond/,"Nepal must use the SAG as a starting point to show better performance in the Asian Games and Olympics by keeping politics at bay
The 13th South Asian Games (SAG) concluded on Tuesday, with Nepal ranking second in the medal tally, riding on its best performance in all the games held to date. Pakistan will now host the 14th SAG. Nepal won a record number of medals – 51 golds, 60 silvers and 95 bronzes – in the SAG, including a gold in men’s football, a big achievement in itself. Nepal began on a winning streak with a haul of 15 golds on a single day, 14 of them in martial arts. What followed proved that Nepal’s forte lay in individual events, athletics and swimming included. Seventeen-year-old Gaurika Singh was the darling of the swimming events, bagging four gold medals, two silvers and three bronzes in different categories, equaling the overall record of Deepak Bista who had bagged four golds in taekwondo from as many SAG games. Gaurika is now eyeing the Olympics, which will be held in nine months. There were more favourable outcomes to make Nepal proud. Kiran Singh Bogati won the marathon gold held on Saturday while Santoshi Shrestha won the women’s 10,000m race, becoming the first Nepali woman athlete to win a gold medal. Gopi Chandra Parki bagged the men’s 5,000m gold. Baikuntha Manandhar is the first Nepali athlete to have performed a hat-trick in marathon in three consecutive editions of the SAG. Minu Gurung also became the first Nepali female boxer to win a gold in the 54kg category.
For the Nepali sports fraternity, the 13th edition of SAG will be something to remember for ages to come, thanks to the excellent performance, especially in individual events. A record number of medals were won by women while new records were also set in some events. One of the features of the game was that it was also held in the Lake City of Pokhara and the religious city of Janakpur to show that a regional level sports event could also be organised outside the capital. The National Sports Council (NSC) left no stone unturned to make it a grand success with people from all walks of life cooperating with great fervour, even though the necessary infrastructure was undergoing renovation till the last minute.
The SAG has concluded successfully, but the NSC cannot afford to rest on its laurels. This is a regional sporting event, which must be capitalised as a launching pad to now win medals in the Asian Games and the Olympics. The concerned ministry, in tandem with other sporting agencies, must rigorously train our sportspersons and start hunting for budding talents in areas where Nepal can perform fairly well in international events. While making adequate investment in sports, we must keep politics away from it, as the tendency has been to use the different sports bodies to serve the interests of the parties in power. Unlike other regions of the world, sports is not a priority of governments in South Asia, in general, and Nepal, in particular. This edition has, however, shown that Nepal holds huge potential, especially in individual sports. Despite the many hiccups, including delay in rebuilding the Dasharath Stadium and failure to provide the needed sports gear and equipment, Nepal has once again proved its ability to host the regional extravaganza within a limited time. All deserve praise for making it a grand success.
Children’s safety
Police have arrested an American citizen on the charge of sexually abusing minors in Kathmandu. Jason Lloyd Moody, 40, of Illinois, was arrested Monday from a hotel near the airport for sexually abusing three girls below 11 and also on the charge of abusing four underage boys. This, however, is not the first time a foreigner has been arrested for sexually abusing minors. The frequency with which reports about paedophiles are appearing in the media means that it could be a matter of serious concern, demanding immediate attention of the government, parents and the society at large.
Poverty makes it easy for paedophiles to prey on children, as was the case in the above incident, where all three girls came from squatter settlements. Entering Nepal is easy with visas readily available on arrival for anyone. As Nepal embarks on a mission to bring in two million tourists during the Visit Nepal Year 2020, one must see to it that such unwanted elements are rounded up before they do any harm. Hotels must be made to report on any suspicious presence of minors there. The authorities and the society must also keep close watch of shelter homes and such places where children are likely to be abused.

About nine centuries ago, a monk meditating at the base of Zeborong Mountain—in Bhijer, current day upper Dolpa—found himself on foot, retracing snow leopard pugmarks. He had lost his mandala and assumed that the animal’s signs would lead him to his valuable. He ended up in Jumla, ruled by a distraught king, whose queen had been suffering from a seemingly incurable illness. The monk was not a medical practitioner, but upon the king’s insistence, he prayed for three days, and the queen was saved. As a reward, Nasar Gumba was established in Bhijer, as the local belief goes. Even at the dawn of the 21st century, snow leopards continue to be protected by their cultural entrenchments in our country. But in today’s anthropocentric society, snow leopards face many threats that demand urgent attention. With population estimates at 4,000-6,000, distributed across just 12 countries in the world, the future of this species hangs on a precarious balance. Efforts to save the species continue globally, and Nepal is a frontrunner.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
This urgency brought us to Shey-Phoksundo National Park (SPNP) last month on the government’s mission to collar two snow leopards with satellite telemetry devices. Our research mission, led by the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC), involved a team of around 20-25 individuals – local citizen scientists, SPNP staff, members of National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC) as well as WWF researchers.
Our selection of Samling Gumba—an 834-year-old monastery, located towards the south of Bhijer—as our expedition base camp was a product of periodical automated camera trap surveys. In May 2018, camera traps placed over 300 sq. km around Bhijer village had confirmed the presence of at least 14 individual snow leopards, indicating this region as a hotspot. Camera trapping was also conducted in September 2019 to identify current movement patterns of snow leopards before the team set out in mid-October. Given the pre-assumed density of the species in the area, we were enthused by the prospect of fulfilling our mission but dreaded disappointment—given the elusive nature of the species.
We arrived in Samling Gumba with a mixed bag of emotions and equipment, following ten days of travel and preparation. Operations ensued following a prayer ceremony, led by the head monk. We then oriented citizen scientists and SPNP game scouts on the objectives and methodology. From them, we learned about the landscape and movement patterns of snow leopards. But we were faced with a ‘needle-in-a-haystack’ situation: we had a total of 24 traps (less than 2 sq. feet each) distributed across 50 sq. kilometres.
Nonetheless, we leveraged our strategic advantage – combining existing knowledge on snow leopard ecology and movement with information from camera traps, we planned and placed the traps. Each of these traps was remotely monitored using radio transmitters at hourly-intervals.
The trap monitoring team mostly reported ‘all normal’, relaying that none of the traps had been activated. Occasionally, they reported changes in transmitter signals, triggering excited frenzies at our base camp, as a team prepared for visual verification of the activated trap site only to be greeted by disappointment. Most activations were caused by the abundant livestock that form a major livelihood source for the community or from non-subject wildlife. This cycle of wait, monitor, hope, false triggers and trap resetting persisted for about 15 days. Then, on the 16th morning, the farthest trap from our base was activated. A team sent for visual confirmation reported in loud whispers from the trap site, “A snow leopard has been captured, come quickly,” evoking a camp-wide cheer.
Everything moved really fast then. The entire team left from the camp, and trekked towards Bhijer village, descending further into and walking up the river valley, reaching the capture site. The animal was sedated, freed from the trap, examined for necessary data collection, collared, and released back into the wild. Before the release, our citizen scientist named the animal Zeborong, after the local Snow Leopard Conservation Committee in the region. The second animal, Samling Gumba, was trapped just two nights later.
Over the coming months, we will be monitoring the two animals and building an invaluable database on their home range, movement patterns, among other critical information that will aid in species conservation planning. Such research, although resource-intensive, is an important element in conservation. Similar research in Kanchenjunga Conservation Area and other parts of Nepal had earlier provided critical inputs to the country’s Snow Leopard Conservation Action Plan and the world’s first climate-smart Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Management Plan – Eastern Himalayan Landscape.
The traditions of various mountain communities continue to help snow leopards thrive in Nepal. With advanced science, increased understanding and concern of local communities towards the environment and informed leadership of the government, Nepal promises to be a global stronghold for the survival of snow leopards, in perpetuity.

287,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/a-girl-in-the-wild/,"Very few girls in our country get to work “in the wild”, but I did get an opportunity to involve in a Snow Leopard monitoring project in Shey-Phoksundo National Park, Dolpa. It was organised by the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund, and I have learnt so much from this journey.
Many people think that this kind of work is too challenging for a woman. And challenging it is! But I believe it is as hard for a man as it is for a woman. But in spite of the hardships, there are some invaluable things “in the wild”. The environment is so overwhelming: the air is fresh, the sky is clean, and the peacefulness of the surroundings brings you inner peace of mind, to the point where the negativity doesn’t affect you.
One of the thrilling experiences was walking not only off road but along steep cliffs and ridgelines. At first I felt very dizzy looking down and had to slow down my pace. But after a while, I lost that fear completely and even started to enjoy walking on the ridgelines.
I am convinced that a major source of motivation to stand strong in moments like these was what I learnt at the Vipassana Meditation Centre – Anichhya, or the lesson of impermanence. Though we are going through pleasant or unpleasant moments, we should keep in mind that everything is Anichiyaa. So our mind should always remain equanimous.
This lesson really helped me when I was walking uphill, or when we had to walk 12 hours a day for a few days in a row. I would tell myself: “If I keep walking, even very small steps, I will not remain in the same place.” I found this thought very practical. Whenever I saw a steep hill or mountain, I would think: “Okay! It needs to be crossed, so start walking and keep going.”
Another source of motivation during this expedition was my supportive colleagues, especially the men. When I was in the field with my fellow citizen scientists, I found them to be very attentive and supportive towards me and other colleagues.
From this, I understood that to support and respect women, no deep knowledge of gender equity and social inclusion (GESI) is required. Ultimately, it’s about humanity, humility and kindness. From this journey, one thing I can state with confidence is that instead of underestimating us, women, give us the opportunities, be supportive, and we will pay you back with success.

288,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-chapter-of-accidents/,"Heavy penalties are a must to strictly enforce the traffic rules for the safety of both passengers and pedestrians
Vehicular accidents are routine in Nepal, almost an everyday incident, and they fail to raise much concern except when a mishap involves many deaths or when the locals’ reaction to it spirals out of control, as in the case of Kohalpur on Sunday. Locals resorted to vandalism after a truck knocked down a girl while trying to cross the road to enter her school. The girl, a seventh grader, had to be flown in to Kathmandu after both her legs suffered severe injury and could not be treated in nearby Nepalgunj. After the demonstrations took a nasty turn, police forces had to be trucked in to quell the agitation and bring the situation under control. An indefinite prohibitory order has been put in place after irate students and locals set the truck involved in the accident on fire and vandalised hundreds of other vehicles on the Kohalpur-Nepalgunj road. At least 24 persons, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police and eight cops, were injured in clashes, three of them critically.
There are many reasons why accidents take place in Nepal. It’s all too easy to blame the mountain roads that are usually in tatters. Not only highways, even the streets of the capital are in need of major repairs. Even by the government’s account, it needs about Rs 88 billion to repair the country’s roads annually. But it has earmarked only one-tenth that amount for this fiscal. Add to the bad condition of the roads the poorly-maintained vehicles, overloading and drivers with poor driving skills, and you have a perfect recipe for a disaster. With vehicular accidents said to kill about 2,000 people annually in the country, the government must have a plan of action to rein in on the growing number of accidents in the country. With the increase in the number of vehicles year after year, the number of accidents as well as that of deaths and injuries will only increase if the concerned authorities do not act now.
Can something be done? The government could begin by making license issuance stricter. It is common knowledge that licenses can be bought in Nepal. Only recently, senior officials of the licensing department and traffic police officers were arrested by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority for having distributed 1200 licenses to those who had failed the trial or had not even appeared for it within a period of three months in 2012. Imagine the number of people who are driving vehicles in Nepal without deserving a license. The number of accidents would come down drastically if only everyone – both drivers and pedestrians – were to follow the traffic rules earnestly. Everyone is witness to public buses and micro-vans cramming as many passengers as possible to make some extra money for the driver and the helper. And one can see them speeding in the cities or on the highways to be the first to collect passengers. This greed to make a fast buck at the expense of the commuters is making travel unsafe for everyone.  The one thing drivers fear is heavy penalties. This will have to be strictly enforced to implement the traffic rules for the safety of both passengers and pedestrians.

Act prudently
Nepal’s constitution, which paved the way for the transition from a unitary to the federal system of government, has clearly laid out the framework for fiscal federalism. This framework allows provincial and local governments to prepare annual income and expenditure plans, providing sub-national governments the mandate to pursue development works. But local governments have lately been misusing their authority by getting involved in irregularities, according to a report prepared by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). The corruption watchdog’s report said local governments released payments to contractors prior to completion of the work and prepared project completion reports before completing the projects. The local governments also colluded with consumer committee members to haphazardly award contracts. These practices must stop.
Local governments are nascent. But that does not give them the leeway to engage in corruption. The CIAA has already asked them to refer to the Public Procurement Act before awarding contracts and releasing payments. It has also directed them to immediately terminate the contracts that were illegally awarded and start a fresh bidding process. Local governments should heed these calls, act prudently from now onwards and follow good governance practices.

The country’s oldest educational institution, Tri-Chandra Campus (TC), recently witnessed a strange event. Students physically assaulted the campus chief, Professor Pradeep Neupane. The incident happened when a mob, led by the ANNSFU (All Nepal National Free Students’ Union) that was protesting against the 100% fee hike in the Science and Humanities faculties, got enraged. ANNSFU is the student wing of the ruling party.
According to eye-witnesses and staff of Tri-Chandra Campus, the mob pulled Prof Neupane out of the building and on to the street, assaulting him several times on the way. As seen on the CCTV footages, Prof Neupane was thrown on to the floor, kicked and also walked over. At present, Prof Neupane’s office is padlocked, he is in a hospital bed, and nobody knows what is upcoming.
The government, human rights activists and Tribhuvan University (TU), the parent institution of TC, all are silent, but why? Will Prof Neupane be able to safely return to his workplace? Furthermore, will the ruling party take responsibility for the incident? These questions remain unanswered.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
TC has been growing as a hub of some ill-minded people in the name of student politics since the past couple of years. Students indulging in narcotics and drunkenness can be seen on the shabby side of TC. This is a threat to the genuine students.
This college is the first choice of students representing all social classes because of its nominal tuition fees and prime location. Because students coming from a higher social status have made it a transit point for abroad studies, the drop-out rate at TC is quite alarming.
It is more than 60% between the first and fourth year at the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.).
Professor Neupane has initiated some improvements at TC. Laboratories have been renovated with funds received from the University Grants Commission. The college, even though the oldest centre for higher education in Nepal, has been profoundly lacking in scientific equipment, requiring instruments worth more than Rs 10 billion.
Sadly enough, the student leaders seldom speak about the condition of the college, and what they have ever said about the state of the college is nothing but porkies. Nevertheless, the main problem is student politics at Tri-Chandra.
Constituent campuses of TU have the right to set up their own tuition fees after taking approval from the university. Prithvi Narayan Campus, Pokhara has set the annual fees at Rs 11,000 for General B.Sc. and Rs 24, 000 for B.Sc in Microbiology, whereas for B.Sc in Geology, one has to pay about Rs 33,000.
Another constituent campus of TU, Birendra Multiple Campus, Chitwan charges Rs 24,000 for B.Sc in Microbiology and Rs 36,000 for B.Sc in Geology, or B.Sc. in Meteorology. Private and community colleges, on the other hand, charge annual tuition fees of more than Rs 50,000, even for regular B.Sc General Science.
At Tri-Chandra, for the bachelor’s programme in Science, students had been paying Rs 7,000.
However, the fee has been raised to Rs 14,000 with the 100% hike mentioned earlier. This increment in fees is well-founded as the operational costs of the science programmes are incomparable to other disciplines.
Besides, the increment in fees does not affect the current students; it is only applicable for the next batch of first years.
Currently, there are more than 14,000 students studying at Tri-Chandra Campus, making it the largest campus in terms of enrollment.
Last year, this campus suffered a deficit of Rs 17 million because fees had not been adjusted for a long time. Most of the fees collected are spent on the payment of contract-based as well as part-time teachers, who unlike permanent faculties, are paid by TC itself rather than by TU.
As noticed by everyone, part-time faculties are a severe burden on the college, as they number very high. In physics, there are 46 part-timers; in microbiology, 36 part-timers; and in chemistry, 60 part-timers. The condition is quite similar in other departments as well.
Tribhuvan University has set a quota of 2,500 students for the B.Sc. programme, but TC is incapable of hosting such a mass. The campus has launched 18 different science combination programmes at the undergraduate level, which is probably the highest in all of South Asia.
No one has paid attention to addressing the shortage of classrooms on the campus. According to the students, some teachers do not attend practical classes. The college library severely lacks books. Such issues are not correctly handled by the college administration due to political polarisation and other reasons.
Currently, 40 per cent of the students enrolled in the Science and Technology programmes under the banner of TU have taken admission in TC. TU has five constituent campuses in the Kathmandu Valley, but students prefer to join TC, but this is not to be understood that education in TC is good. In reality TC is not able to deliver quality education.
This year, 343 students have given entrance examinations to join Amrit Campus, 62 to join Padmakanya Campus, 36 to join Bhaktapur, 118 to join Patan and 2,704 to join TC.
Because of the overflow of students, about 200 students attend the basic science laboratories, such as physics and chemistry, but their capacity is less than 40. Tribhuvan University has neither diverted the students to another college, nor has it managed the problems of TC.

Love has many colours and contours. And once I was also enveloped with the amorous version of love for one of my classmates in the university. It was otherwise a usual insipid day in the class, although our erudite professor was in his intellectual trance and was raining on us his blitzkrieg of unheard English words. A gentle knock on the door instantly drew my intention as I was sitting on the first desk quite close to the door.
A maiden bestowed with divine beauty and peerless grace elegantly sought the permission of the professor to come in. It was her first day in the class as she told me after the professor stopped droning on. Nidhi was somewhat late in taking admission, and thus she sought my assistance in managing with her backlog.
Over the months, we both became the best of friends and while studying together we would grab all the fun by bunking classes and watching the recently released movies. Now a close friendship was on the brink of blossoming into love. When we both were exactly on the same mantle wave length, I rolled out my feelings to her. In no time my love was reciprocated.
Cupid had now blessed me with my Muse. Like most of the lovers we also began to meet furtively outside the university and thereon decided to get spliced with each other for the life time.
But the much needed consent of her family could only translate our amorous dream into reality.
One day my Muse mustered up her courage and introduced me to her parents. But our destinies had different designs for us.
Her parents sternly disapproved our would-be love marriage, and tied her nuptial knot with someone else against her wishes. I was back to my home town with the degree of MA but without my Muse.
Twenty years have rolled by since I saw my love for the last time. After parting with her, I could not gel with any other girl. Having no malice against his Muse, this 46-years-old confirmed bachelor has now a vast treasure of memories of that elevating love.

Runaway urbanisation in the Kathmandu Valley has fueled a demand for construction materials, and bricks are the primary building material in the capital as they are in other parts of the country. One has only to take a stroll on the outskirts of the city, and you see dozens of brick kilns belching out thick stacks of smoke into the atmosphere. The pollutants not only impact the air quality and visibility of the surroundings, but also adversely affect the health of the workers and the local population. Brick kiln workers, who are directly exposed to dust and smoke day in, day out, are particularly prone to a host of respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, pneumonia, chronic cough, bronchitis and wheezing. However, a recent research done on 20 brick kilns of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur shows that majority of the brick kiln workers are unaware about the impact of dust and smoke on their health. Resource Centre for Primary Health Care had conducted the study to learn about the health status of the brick kiln workers and also about the occupational safety at the work place. The serious health risks posed to the brick kiln workers should be of concern to the government as well as the owners, and efforts must be made to reduce their exposure to smoke and dust.
The government has tried to ban the Fixed Bull Trench Kiln that is in vogue as it uses old and inefficient technology, which requires large quantities of coal to fire the bricks. The method is inefficient and poses a big threat to health and the environment as it releases large amounts of particulate matter, black carbon, sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Asthma and bronchitis apart, long-term exposure to such particles and smoke makes brick kiln workers susceptible to hypertension, cardiac problems and cancer. The brick kiln workers make up mostly migrants, who come to work for just six months, from December to June. The industry is largely unregulated, with the workers having no links to the local government or community organisations. This perhaps explains why the plight of the workers has gone largely unnoticed, except for occasional studies on health and pollution carried out by non-governmental organisations.
The emission of particulate matters and smoke could be drastically cut down by the use of improved technology in brick making. New technologies such as the Vertical Shift Brick Kiln (VSBK), Tunnel Kiln and Hybrid Hoffman Kiln are substantially cleaner than the Fixed Bull Trench Kilns. The brick sector is one of the most energy-intensive industrial sectors in Nepal. In the Fixed Bull Trench Kilns, energy cost is almost 32 per cent of product value whereas in a Vertical Shift Brick Kiln, it is 14 per cent. The introduction of new technologies in Nepal could save both the ecology and economy while reducing the health hazards. In February last year, the Ministry of Population and Environment issued standards for brick kiln emission and chimney height in a bid to limit air pollutants emitted by the brick factories. It is the government’s duty to follow up on them and see to it that the brick kilns abide by the rules so that everyone can enjoy the right to a clean environment.

‘Occupy Tundikhel’
Occupy Tundikhel campaign has entered its fifth week. During the campaign, scores of social activists have been organising various programmes daily to exert pressure on the government to stop the illegal encroachment at Tundikhel. According to historians, before 1950, Tundikhel covered the area from the Dashrath Stadium to the south to Rani Pokhari to the north. At present, its area has shrunk to the Nepal Army’s Pavilion adjoining Khula Manch, which is not open for the public. More than two-thirds of the area is occupied by construction materials meant for different construction projects around the Tundikhel area. The remaining area is used as a bus park, leaving no space for the public.
Tundikhel holds cultural significance and is part of the identity of Kathmandu. Tundikhel is an important community space that needs to be protected. Elsewhere, uncontrolled and unguided urbanisation has taken a toll of fertile lands that are inappropriate for construction. Government and community land has also been encroached and sold. The various guthi ponds in the Valley have been destroyed by the construction of shopping malls. A systematic and strictly enforced land use planning is essential for Nepal.

The inflow of remittances is an old topic in the study of migration, but one that has stimulated renewed policy focus in recent years. As global remittances are taking an upward trend to a degree that is on par with global development assistance and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the developing world, it is not surprising that this subject is of interest to policymakers.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
Many reasons have been cited as to why migrants send money home. These include explanations of remittance behavior, such as ‘altruism’, which indicates that remittances go up when the economic requirements of families back home rise; the notion of ‘exchange’ which suggests that migrants are effectively repaying family and relatives for investments in the education or travel of the migrant; and the notion of ‘co-insurance’ where both migrants and family provide monetary and in-kind transfers to safeguard the other against short-lived shocks. It is generally agreed that remittances are likely to be higher in conditions where the migrant leaves the country due to economic rather than social or political factors, where they have temporary rather than permanent resident status, and where they have a family left behind.
The 2019 United Nations Report on the world’s progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) divulges that personal inflows of remittances from migrant workers are the largest source of external financing for low and middle-income countries (LMICs). According to the World Bank’s latest Migration and Development Brief, remittance flows to LMICs grew by 9.6 per cent in 2018 (up from the 8.8 percent rise in 2017), to reach a record $529 billion. They represent more than three times the size of official development assistance. Moreover, as FDI has been taking a downward trend in recent years, remittances stood close to the level of FDI flows in 2018. Further, in 2018, remittances represented more than 30 per cent of GDP in countries such as Tonga (35.2 %), Kyrgyz Republic (33.6 %), Tajikistan (31.0 %), and Haiti (30.7 %).
Remittance flows have a direct impact on recipient households by lowering poverty and inequality and increasing consumption and social well-being. They also have a positive impact on financial sector developments, such as increasing the access and use of financial intermediaries. They support in improving credit ratings of countries and help raise external financing.
Although remittances have a host of advantages, the remittance market, to a large extent, has not been exploited for prospective financial services. Furthermore, remittances are often not directed into productive investments  due to a) dearth of investment knowledge of the remittance clients, b) inconsistency in remittance transactions, and c) inappropriate investment-friendly climate. Again, remittances can produce currency appreciation, causing export prices to surge and import prices to be cheaper. Thus, there is a drop in export levels, and rise in import levels, which can impact the production markets by reducing employment.
An important disadvantage is that it can also encourage more migration of labour as family members obtaining remittances realise that they would be better off moving to other destinations and earn more money rather than staying back in their home country. Another drawback is that the country’s dependence on remittances increases. And, this could be alarming as an abrupt stop in these financial inflows could lead to a financial debacle.
In Nepal’s case, migrant remittances from abroad are a crucial source of income for the economy. They represented 2 per cent of GDP in FY2000, 22 per cent in 2010 and 28 per cent in FY2018. Though remittances have been generally used to finance consumption in the country rather than being channeled to raise productive capacity, spending remittances on consumption has, to some degree, led to improved private and public welfare.
However, there are also detrimental outcomes of being over-dependent on remittances. Too much dependence opens up Nepal to exposure to external shocks linked to remittance-sending countries. Likewise, remittance inflows have had a knock-on effect on imports. With exports dwindling, trade deficit has expanded.
Still, the overall impact of remittances in comparison to other types of international financial transfers has been encouraging and should be fortified more with appropriate policies without creating a dependency syndrome.
Remittances to Nepal have been generally observed as an important tool to reduce poverty and inequality, to impart social benefits, to act as buffers against economic shocks, and to produce other positive impacts. Still, their full developmental potential has not been realised so far.
The successful mobilisation of remittances for productive purposes basically hinges on the capacity of the government to build a ‘development-centred’ macroeconomic environment along with supporting the establishment of a viable and inclusive financial sector. Likewise, joint and intensive efforts must be aimed at establishing and improving the mechanisms through which the principal actors, especially the individual remittance senders and recipients, can leverage these flows for developmental purposes.

293,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/an-unusual-samaritan/,"On October 31 this year, I was travelling to Trivandrum, India, to participate in the Counseling course conducted by Don Bosco, Trivandrum. I boarded Nepal Airlines at Tribhuvan International Airport at 2.30 p.m. I took my allotted seat, and to my left were seated two young ladies. They were Nepalis and going to Bangalore. They were engrossed in their mobiles
while I sat reading a book “Treasure of Life” on the topic “Happiness”.
Being an extrovert, I wanted to talk to the lady sitting right next to me. But I was hesitant to talk to her, because I was a stranger to her as she was to me on the plane. Finally, I gathered enough courage and asked, “Bahini (sister) where do you stay?”
“I live in Kathmandu and am going for IT training in Bangalore,” she replied. I told her about myself that I was from St. Xavier’s School, Jawalakhel. She then said, “My brother went to St. Xavier’s School, Jawalakhel.”
As the flight was about to land at Bangalore, I wished her, “All the best for your training.”
We parted while deboarding the plane. From Bangalore, I was to take the flight on Indigo Airlines to Trivandrum at 8.20 that evening according to the booked ticket time. But the scheduled time had been brought forward to 6.25 p.m., and so at Bangalore Airport, I missed the flight to Trivandrum.
There were no flights to Trivandrum that evening. At the counter, I was told that there would be a flight to Trivandrum at 5.05 in the morning the following day, that is, November 1. But I did not have enough money to buy the air ticket to Trivandrum. I really was in a difficult situation.
Sitting close to me was a gentleman, who  was going to Hyderabad, India. His flight was scheduled for 10 p.m. I expressed my difficult and helpless situation to him. He then said to me, “Don’t worry, I will buy a ticket for you.”  To hear him say so, I was greatly relieved of my distress.  I thanked him for his great kind heart in trying to help me. I took his email address and phone number.
I asked him how much he had paid for the air ticket. He did not tell me. In the mean time, it was 10 p.m. and time for him to proceed towards the boarding gate.
As we parted from each other, I said, “Thank you very much, Pramod.” It was a miracle for me to come across such a kind-hearted man at the right time to help me.

294,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-vexed-expats/,"The government must take up the issue of visas for expats’ spouses seriously and try to resolve it in double quick time
An investment-friendly environment, apart from guarantee of returns on investments, is a must to lure foreign investment. And on the eve of the Nepal Investment Summit held earlier this year on March 29-30, the government went all out to introduce the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act (FITTA) in a bid to woo the maximum number of investors to Nepal. However, the act, introduced in haste without holding broad consultations with the stakeholders, has certain ambiguities that tend to vex expatriates living in Nepal. One such vexation has to do with the difficulty of bringing their spouses to Nepal. Officials at the Department of Industry acknowledge that quite few expats have already lodged complaints demanding simplification of the procedures that would allow their spouses to get visas easily. The existing provision could discourage skilled workers from coming to Nepal while also hindering the flow of foreign capital into the country. Despite the complaints, it seems there is little the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Section at the Department of Industry can do as it requires an amendment to the act itself, which will have to wait until the House of Representatives sits for the winter session.
FITTA repealed the Foreign Investment and Transfer of Technology Act 1992 to bring reform in the foreign investment regime in Nepal. FITTA was passed together with the Public Private Partnership Investment Act 2019, with the former designed for the safe repatriation of profits, and the latter for facilitation of investments in the country. The government had also introduced or amended a number of other laws aimed at attracting foreign investment in the country. They included the Industrial Enterprises Act and Special Economic Zone Act, among others. One of the features of FITTA is that it has provisioned a One-Stop Service Mechanism, which came into operation just weeks after the Nepal Investment Summit 2019, where the government had guaranteed “world class treatment, facilitation and service to investors”. What the one-stop service means to the investors, both Nepali and foreign, is that they will no longer have to visit different government agencies located at different places for registration, approval and other administration clearances to set up a business in the country. The centre has brought altogether 14 different government agencies involved in approving investments at one place. Their offices represent immigration, customs, labour, the central bank, environment ministry and industry ministry.
The government cannot, however, sit back in a complacent manner thinking it has done enough by introducing or amending laws to attract FDI. True, Nepal Investment Summit 2019 was a grand success, with both Nepali and foreign investors committing almost US$ 17.5 billion in various projects. However, how much of that pledge will be realised will depend on the working environment in Nepal. Even a small irritant could impede the flow of capital to this country. The government must take up the issue related to visas for expats’ spouses seriously and try to resolve it in double quick time.

Act swiftly
Banke district is facing a severe shortage of construction materials, such as stones, boulders and sand, leading to delay in construction of infrastructure projects. One of the major projects affected by lack of riverbed materials is Sikta Irrigation, a national pride project. This is not the first time construction of projects, considered crucial to stimulate economic growth, has been hit by a shortage of river-based resources. Earlier, the developer of Gautam Buddha International Airport faced the same problem, leading to months of delay in project construction. If this problem continues to recur, Nepal can never bridge the huge infrastructure gap required to put the economy on a higher growth trajectory.
It is, therefore, high time the federal government coordinated with the provincial and local governments to address this issue. Local governments must take the lead to resolve this problem, as they are the authorised body to provide permits to extract riverbed materials. Banke is facing a shortage of river-based resources because of delay made by Raptisonari Rural Municipality to award the contract. As a result, river-borne materials are being illegally excavated. This can cause serious harm to the environment. Local governments should take note of these repercussions and act swiftly.

295,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/electoral-reforms-to-ensure-free-fair-polls/,"The huge number of laws has meant that the process of election becomes difficult, tedious and confusing from the legal standpoint. So there are calls for integrating these laws into an umbrella Act to simplify the process
Nepal has made big strides in constitutional, electoral and legal reforms in the past several years. Following the promulgation of the new constitution in 2015, Nepal held a series of elections for all three tiers of governments – central, provincial and local level. Nepal follows a mixed model of election system, including First-Past-The-Post, Proportional Representation as well as Single Transferable Voting System. The country is currently experiencing transition to a federal democratic republic and is in the process of formulating hundreds of new laws in line with the new constitution.
At the centre of debate is reform in the electoral laws. Nepal presently has a set of 11 different Acts, 29 different Rules and over 80 Directives related to election.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
As such, there are over 100 laws that govern elections. The huge number of laws has meant that the process of election becomes difficult, tedious and confusing from the legal standpoint. Naturally, there are calls for integrating or codifying these laws into an umbrella Act to simplify the process.
In practical terms, the current system in Nepal has also led to several problems that often impede the holding of free, fair and independent elections. Political dominance in the appointment of the Election Commissioners, financial control by the executive, control of human resources by the executive and the power of declaring the election date in the executive have meant that the Election Commission of Nepal (ECN) is not as fully autonomous as is envisaged by the constitution.
Therefore, it is imperative for Nepal to undertake a series of reforms in electoral governance. After the series of elections in 2017, there is a stable government at the centre as well as in the provinces and the local levels.
Before the next round of elections in 2022, there is ample time to discuss and decide upon the new set of reforms. Nepal Law Society (NLS) has been supporting constitutional development, rule of law, an independent judiciary and electoral reforms since the last four decades.
In the past, the NLS was engaged in the observation of 11 elections, including parliamentary as well as local elections.
Against the backdrop of those observations, the NLS and other stakeholders have long felt the need to undertake reforms in election laws. In 2018, the NLS joined hands with the ECN and the IFES/USAID to explore the areas of reforms and identify the needs. The series of programs, interactions and studies have resulted in the following conclusions.
Widespread need has been felt by all the stakeholders – the government, ECN, Federal Parliament and civil society – about the need to reduce the number of election-related laws to make them better managed and simple to understand and execute with the ultimate aim of ensuring free and fair elections. In the elections held in 2017, there were several controversies and disputes regarding the application of election laws – such as in the registration of the electoral rolls, publication of ballot papers, vote counting procedure, delay in declaration of results as well as the implementation of the election code of conduct. In short, we have concluded that in order to overcome the aforementioned obstacles, Nepal should have just two major elections laws – an Act related to the ECN and an Integrated Act on Election.
To integrate the several election-related provisions into a codified law, a group of 10 election and drafting experts are currently working to give final shape to the two laws. The ECN is also closely involved in guiding the team of experts so that the laws are tailor-made.
The proposed reforms in the draft include reforms in all three phases – pre-election, during election and post-election. In the pre-election phase, the draft proposes that election programmes be announced at least three months in advance; that the power to declare the election date as well as administer election officials and control finances be given to the commission; stringent power to the ECN to enforce the code of conduct; and stringent provisions to regulate the political financing of the elections by making transactions through banks compulsory.
Likewise, it proposes reform to ensure that all voters who reach 18 years of age on the election date are included. It proposes reforms in the selection of polling centres and ensuring that they are gender- and disabled-friendly. The draft also proposes providing power to the ECN to strictly enforce the constitutional provision regarding the quotas for women and other minorities.
During election, the draft proposes easing transport and movement during the day; ensuring accessible polling centres; and power to the Returning Officer to declare the polling void in case of any undue activities. In the post-election period, the draft proposes laws allowing immediate vote-counting in the polling centres and declaration of results.
It also proposes the practice of allowing No Vote or None of the Above (NOTA). It also allows for laws permitting voting by eligible Nepalis living overseas. The new proposed reforms
can bring about massive changes in the practice of holding free and fair elections in Nepal, as well as in the whole of the South Asian region, in the coming days.

296,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/contextual-learning/,"“Can education be obtained only in school?” This was a question I had put to the seventh graders. They said that they could also gain knowledge from friends, their mistakes and difficult situations. They got me exactly right. I have always believed that learning could happen anywhere. My one and only purpose to go to school as a child was to read and write. My sources of learning were the different situations, people and their behaviour, environment and friends.
In the rapidly changing world, the roles of schools and teachers are extended. Parents’ expectations have also doubled. But also, if anyone thinks that lessons can be only learnt in school, they are wrong. As a mother or father, you are the first teacher for them.
Last month, I was going to Putalisadak from Pepsicola in a taxi with my nine-year-old son. As soon as it picked up speed, the driver started a casual conversation. When we reached Tinkune, he told us about the overnight makeover of the place. Since it was a day before Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit, the place was being spruced up. The sight of different types of vehicles for cleaning tickled my son’s fancy. The driver was willingly explaining about them to my son. It was
at Baneswor that my son inquired about a torn flex hoarding along the roadside. “Why do people destroy public property instead of maintaining it?” he enquired, sounding like a very aware citizen.
In the mean time, the driver was also talking about how China had developed. From Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin, he had good knowledge about world politics, but seemed to
be annoyed by the country’s political situation. When we reached Maitighar, we saw people busy placing flower pots around the Mandala. Seeing this, he expressed his disapproval of the government making haste at the eleventh hour.
After we got off, we met my mother and sister. It was then that I realised how inspiring that travel had been for my son. No sooner had he met his aunt than he started sharing all that he had learnt from the taxi driver. For a moment, my sister was surprised to see how knowledgeable he was.
What he learnt was contextual learning. Thanks to that person who became a teacher for a moment. I am pretty sure the lesson will remain in his
memory throughout life. In life anyone can teach you lessons, regardless of one’s profession. Learning can take place anywhere.

297,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-for-greater-activism/,"The local school is a good place for intervention, where an appropriate curriculum could help create awareness among the students
The Supreme Court may have made chhaupadi illegal as early as 2006, but that has not prevented the death of more than a dozen women and girls in two districts of Sudurpaschim Province alone in the past one decade. The chhaupadi is a tradition that banishes women to a chhau, or menstruation shed, outside the home during the period. The most recent one to die was Parbati Budha Rawat, 21, in Safebagar Municipality in Achham district of far-west Nepal on Monday. As many as 14 women are said to have died in Achham district in the last 10 years while a mother and her two young sons died of suffocation in nearby Bajura. These are cases that have been reported in the media, and the actual number of women who have died in a chhau shed could be much, much higher, according to women rights activists.
It is inhumane to leave a menstruating woman alone in a shed, where there are chances of her dying of suffocation, snake bite, animal attacks and fires. Those forcing women and girls to live in a chhau face a three-month jail term and fine, but this has not deterred households from keeping the chhaupadi alive. Its belief is so ingrained in society that even legislation and campaigns by both governmental and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have failed to make people see reason. The chhaupadi tradition is not pervasive across Nepal, and is found only in a few districts of mid-west and far-west Nepal. But doing away with the chhaupadi is proving more difficult than envisaged earlier, even though women rights activists have been at it for more than two decades now.
Greater activism by the government, NGOs and society will be needed to put an end to the harsh tradition. At the forefront of this activism should be placed the ward offices, with their elected representatives and government officials, as they are in constant contact with the local people. The local
governments have been empowered with 22 rights, and it is only right they be allowed to take the initiative to tackle the chhaupadi also. Addressing the cause of the problem, namely the ingrained psyche of the people, should help in abolishing the chhaupadi. The local school is a good place for intervention, where an appropriate curriculum could be
introduced to create awareness among the students. The message would automatically reach a wider
audience through them. For this, the teachers, a by-product of the society, would need to change first, and this could be done through an orientation. The FM radio is another powerful tool in disseminating information. Unlike in the past, FM radio stations are widely distributed across the country today and could be used to bring change in the perception of the local people. A visible campaign in the form of banners and flex boards at places and stickers on vehicles should be just as effective in raising the consciousness of the society. If we want concrete results, the activism should not be limited to a few pocket areas, as has been the modus operandi of the NGOs. A holistic approach targeting all the affected districts should reap rich dividends sooner than later.

Education for all
Margeshwori Primary School in Dhankuta has long been facing problems in running classes for children with disabilities due to lack of adequate classrooms and expert teachers. Making a bad situation worse, Dhankuta Municipality has not released funds to the school yet though eight months have passed since the academic session started. The school management has also been demanding a special training session for the teachers. Neither the municipal authority nor the District Education Office seems serious in addressing the genuine concerns of the school management in time. While children with disabilities have very low rates of initial enrolment, they are more likely to drop out and leave school early without transitioning to secondary or higher secondary level because of exclusion or segregation.
The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRCPD) requires states to provide reasonable accommodation for individual students to enable them to access an inclusive education. As a signatory to the UNCRPD, Nepal must put such a system in the local levels, respecting the right to education of children with disabilities. Our education system must be equally accessible to every student regardless of their physical or mental abilities.

The provision of good public transport could also help bring down wear and tear significantly due to lesser number of vehicles on the streets
A fleeting glance through the roads of Nepal invariably reveals a maze of potholes, which have been something of an eyesore for all alike. At one time, the Pathlaiya-Birgunj road was so damaged that it appeared more like a field than a road, and people even planted rice to attract the attention of the government but to no avail. The prime ministers time and again in the past have issued directives to cover them up at different times. Prime Minister Oli has again drawn the attention of his concerned ministry towards them after the cabinet reshuffle, giving four months to cover them up.
Illustration: Ratna Sagar Shrestha/THT
The history of the roads goes back to times immemorial in this part of the world. Ramayan speaks of very beautiful roads in the erstwhile Ravana-reigned golden Lanka. In Buddha’s times, around 7th century BC, two roads — Uttara Pantha, or north bound, and Daxina Pantha, or south bound, existed in India. The north-bound road linked Nepal with the rest of the Indian subcontinent. It passed through Punjab, Rajasthan, Malawa, Mathura, then Panchal and Bideha and Magadh. This road is said to be 1,156 kilometres long, and it had a milestone every kilometre. The Vedic cities primarily consisted of three north-south and three east-west roads. Their echoes, however faint, can still be seen in several cities in the Kathmandu Valley and glaringly in Patan:  the north-south bound roads being the Thapathali-Jawalakhel, Sankhamul-Lagankhel and Balkumari-Lagankhel roads and the east-west roads being the Pulchowk-Gwarko, Lagankhel-Sukuldhoka and Patan Dhoka-Balkumari roads.
Despite having such a long tradition of road buildings dating back to the mythical era, our highways are more of a hole-ways in view of the alcoves existing on their surface. An Unidentified Flying Object, with a moon landing campaign, mistakenly stepping in Nepal like Columbus landing in America in the quest of doing so in India may chant eureka as did Archimedes after solving the problem given by King Hiero II in view of the crater-like ditches on Nepali roads.
The condition of the roads has been dismal in other countries as well, but they were more so in the past than in the present. Chicago roads in 1910 lacked signage, stoplights, or crosswalks. Custom regulated the flow of traffic, not signage, and the most basic rule—keep to the right—often went unheeded. Pedestrians stood in the middle of the roadways to wait for arriving streetcars, crossing wherever they saw fit. Horse-drawn vehicles slowed the movement of streetcars, and drivers loaded and unloaded cargo wherever convenient. Horses also died on the streets—about 5,000 died in 1909 alone—which would cause delays until the Bureau of Streets removed the carcasses. But that was a century ago.
A Road Board was established in 2002 to provide sustainable funds for planned maintenance of roads with the objective of keeping the roads in serviceable condition. But scarce resources and the involvement of too many agencies in what is known as too many cooks spoiling the broth have been the twin problems. The annual budget required for the maintenance of roads in Nepal is Rs 85 billion, but it received only Rs 8 billion from the government in the year 2016/17. This budget has defied the laws of change by remaining unchanged this financial year even after four years when the total budget almost doubled to Rs 1,532 billion from Rs 819 billion in 2016/17. The annual extension of the road length by around 6.5 per cent further aggravates this funding problem. The Road Board works with different road agencies, one of which is the Roads Department. Its main responsibility is to look after strategic road networks. Besides, the Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Rural Roads, under the Ministry of Local Development, looks after the urban, district and local roads by coordinating with the District Development Committees and municipalities. For this, it has to work hand in glove with the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works.
Even though the budget allocated to the Road Boards is miniscule in size, the provision of Rs 163 billion for road infrastructure in the current year’s budget is quite significant as it comes to 10 per cent of the total budget of 1,532 billion. India in 2018 allocated Indian Rs 74,000 crores for the Ministry of Roads, which comes to only 2.5per cent of the total budget of 2,920,484 crores. It is then clear that the road users will have to pay in order to enjoy good road services. This can be done through the medium of toll roads. The other way can be the provision of good public transport, which will bring down wear and tear significantly due to lesser number of vehicles plying on the streets.
The Federal government should act as a facilitator, the provincial government as an implementer and the local government as an operator in this regard as we see in neighbouring India. But the actors forming the trinity appear to be involved in the blame game and at times even at daggers drawn to each other than coordinating properly. This has put the newly adopted Federal System in a crisis as the provincial government, though an important player, appears to be in the back bench more than in the field. This is also one of the main reasons for the inability to spend the developmental budget. If this continues, the potholes will only widen further.

The aerial view sends frequent chills down the spine as you hover around the passers-by and automobiles. The chit chat remains the only constant with the continuously changing scene around.
I still vividly remember such adventurous rides with my grandfather, especially during the festive season. He would make me mount his shoulders and take me to the market to buy groceries. While he meticulously chose the household items, I would drool over the sumptuous candies and chocolates on the glass shelves. At the billing counter, the shop owner would pinch me on my cheek and offer a mango candy, and I would reciprocate with a hearty smile. From there we would go to buy vegetables. The scene at the vegetable market had a peculiar fascination for me. The vendors splashing water on the showcased vegetables to keep them fresh gave me immense joy. After a great deal of negotiation with the vendors and filling our cotton carry bags, we would retire to our home.
Out of all these, my all-time favourite was the shopping for Diwali. Grandpa used to buy me sugary toys, sweets and clothes. On the way, he would stop by the sugarcane juice shop for a refreshing drink.
There was so much of emotion and belongingness in these rides. The chatter while plodding the road was no less than life changing philosophical lessons, capable of stirring lives. I was exposed to a variety of disciplines, which included History, Literature, Philosophy and, most importantly, Ethics. Courtesy to these shoulder rides, I got to know so much about our ancestral family’s forced migration from Pakistan to India, Lord Rama’s victory over Ravana, basic tenets of life and the role of moral values in one’s life. Had I not been privileged to enjoy the Augustus company of my grandparents, I would not have developed this insight and my intellect would certainly have been dormant.
I owe a great deal to my grandpa for acquainting me with the life outside. And on the contrary, I feel pity for the millennial for being deprived of the joy rides we used to have. They may have more luxuries at their disposal but they indubitably miss out on the innocence and originality of life.

They say that ‘you live and learn’. What does it take for a society to learn about the importance of truth? The whole foundation of transitional justice (TJ) is the truth. Based on that truth, we remember what actually happened here in our country. Based on that truth, we bring justice and reparations and remedy to those who have suffered, victims and survivors.  Based on that truth, we reform and improve our institutions and practices to reduce the chances of that kind of disaster happening to us once again.
I want to look at what happened on November 21, 2006 – when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed – through the prism of the truth and hope it can be a learning experience. I apologise in advance if I offend anyone, but clearly in Nepal today, the truth is inconvenient to some. But without the truth, we will be condemned to go around in circles like a dog or a bear on a short chain, which first gets angry and then goes mad.
Before I begin my diary of November 21, let me just make one thing clear; transitional justice is a great and inevitable opportunity for us to learn from the past to make a better future. It is not a gesture of revenge but a signpost of hope for all of us. It is not an obstacle on our path towards stability and prosperity; it is that path! TJ is a challenge by which we test ourselves, our vision of the future and the kind of society we want to build out of the rubble of the decade of conflict. Everyone, including our leaders and diplomatic friends, must understand this.
Remembrance is the least we can offer to honour our dead, tortured, all our victims. But only the victims and civil society chose to remember the 13th anniversary of our rediscovery of peace. If the victims hadn’t organised events and journalists marked the day, it would have passed in silence, buried like the 17,000 of our compatriots who will never see another anniversary.
We will never know what positions politicians took on TJ during the CPA negotiations in 2006 as it all took place in private, behind closed doors, without civil society’s participation, no women, just high-caste men drinking whiskey in smoky rooms. But from now, we can insist that there will be transparency and the truth.  They all now claim to have constantly defended the truth process even if the experience of the 13 years could make us doubt this from all of them.
Our peace process is a great event in our history, and we must cherish it and keep it alive.  But we must examine it with the truth. Let us not forget that in April last year, at the request of our political leaders, an embassy in Kathmandu brought a secret political mission from Colombia in the hope of finding a magic solution to the issue of TJ, that is, how to make it go away with no political damage, with no custodial sentences. But the Colombians who were brought, in wisdom and honesty, told our leaders that there is no secret to their negotiations. In disgust, our leaders sent them back to South America.

Since 2014, the Supreme Court had clearly said what changes needed to be made to the TJ Act to make it conform to our laws. The UN did the same with regard to international law. Our politicians have had five years to bring an amendment, but nothing has happened.  The previous commissions failed in part due to lack of supporting legislation. Now our leaders say ‘trust us’, this time the commissions will work.  But we have been saying for years that we need the amendment before the appointments, and then participation of civil society in the selections, as per international standards. ‘Trust us,’ they said when they set up a selection committee and then prevented it from doing its work until the decision had been fixed by the leaders in private meetings. Why should we trust any new commissions when it is clear we cannot even trust the selection committee?
Here are my truths: transitional justice is unavoidable, but it cannot happen until the civil society and, in particular, the victims have trust in the process. That trust can only come with transparency on the part of the leaders and genuine participation in the process for victims and human rights groups. The arguments our leaders put forward on November 21 might have worked in 2006, but after 13 years of disappointments and deception, they no longer hold in 2019.
One thing our leaders agree on is that they do not want Universal Jurisdiction, international justice, but they forget that this only ever happens when national measures have failed or there is no political will amongst the politicians and the judiciary.  It is the same with the TJ.  Thus we have only two alternatives: Set up a people’s truth process, to allow an agreed version of what happened to come out through victims’ testimonies. Second, call for international help, which basically means UN expertise. Victims are tired of being lied to, and our leaders risk paying the price due to loss of credibility.
The eyes of the world are on Nepal, and most people want us to succeed. The longer the TJ process remains stuck in the mud, the more we will look like a nation which doesn’t know what it wants, what direction we are seeking. Not just the international human rights community, but potential investors will not be encouraged if we do not show clear determination to tell the truth about the past and learn lessons that allow us to strengthen the rule of law.

301,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/intellects-block/,"Like the writer’s block, today I faced an intellect’s block. I found myself being so attached to past events that I couldn’t think of the present or the future. Thus I couldn’t move forward.
As a writer needs creativity so an intellect needs power and true knowledge to move on. It needs answers to the questions of why, what and how.  As I was figuring out the answer to why, suddenly I felt like why not share this state of blocked intellect with others! The moment I got this thought, my blocked intellect got unblocked.
I looked back to the past and found myself stuck and passing through the tunnel of darkness of the intellect. What helped me to come out of it?  The only answer I got was – creation of a new topic for a column. So far, whatever I have imbibed needs to be shared with others. There might be lot of people who are going through this block. Well, the true natural nature of the soul is giving, sharing the treasure of experience and knowledge.
Nowadays I find a wave of advertising and marketing through sharing of experiences to promote business. Whether it is public speaking, sales or art, they are attracting lots of customers online. Ninety minutes of webinar followed by heavy discounts, including the best take away experiences to expand the business.
Giving means growing. But what is growth?  Spiritually, whatever the intellect has learnt needs to come out in the form of action. If the action is pure, it inspires others to follow it. Pure action ignites the spark of the soul by activating a particular specialty. Suddenly there is a powerful and determined thought backed by zeal and enthusiasm to make it happen. I remember once my colleague took notes in Urdu.  It was so beautiful that I was determined to learn the script in one month. That moment was one of the wow moments of my life.  Impossible became possible and easy.  I found myself easily reading short stories in Urdu.
Intellects’ block is nothing but a sign to look into other areas to explore and experiment.  It’s a call to broaden your intellect with new learnings and experiences. Like we need variety in food, the same way intellect needs variety in the form of knowledge to imbibe and churn.  The more the intellect churns and digests new things, the more activated, creative and innovative it becomes.
The next time when faced with intellects’ block, understand it as a call for change of food for the intellect.

302,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/accessibility-for-inclusion-for-those-living-with-disabilities/,"The universal design concept asserts that anything and everything should be designed in order to be accessible not only to people with diverse disabilities, but more generally to the broadest possible spectrum of humanity
Each year, on December 3, the world marks International Day of People with Disabilities (IDPD) It is a day on which we promote public awareness about the challenges faced by people with disabilities, and the role communities and societies can play in eradicating the barriers to social inclusion. The theme for this year’s IDPD is “Promoting the participation of persons with disabilities and their leadership: taking action on the 2030 Development Agenda” while the national theme is “The Future is Accessible”, which means we all look towards a future without barriers.

More than one billion people live with some form of disability worldwide. In the years ahead, disability will be an even greater concern due to ageing population and the higher risk of disability in older people as well as the global increase in chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders. Understandably, people with disabilities have poorer health outcomes, lower education feats, less economic contribution and higher rates of poverty than people without them.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) came into force in 2008 and strengthened the understanding of disability as a human rights and development priority.
A person’s environment has a huge impact on the magnitude of disability. Inaccessible environments create disability by creating hurdles to participation and inclusion. Examples of the possible negative impact of the environment are a deaf person without a sign language interpreter, a wheelchair user in a building without an accessible toilet and a blind person using a computer lacking screen-reading software. The environment could be changed to improve health conditions, prevent impairments, and improve outcomes for people with disabilities. Such changes can be fetched by legisla¬tion, policy changes, capacity building, or tech¬nological developments.
Article 9 of the UNCRPD cherishes “accessibility” as one of the treaty’s eight general principles. In the preamble of the Convention, we learn that accessibility is closely tied to the evolving definition of disability. The universal design concept asserts that anything and everything should be designed in order to be accessible not only to people with diverse disabilities, but more generally to the broadest possible spectrum of humanity. For example, public buildings designed with ramps at entranceways allow for the easy movement of persons with mobility disabilities, along with pregnant women; parents with a baby carriage; people with injuries; and older persons. In the same way, for information accessibility, television programmes with subtitles and voice over ensure accessibility to people with hearing impairment as well as those watching in a noisy setting.
The Sustainable Development Goals have a strong and explicit focus on disability, promulgating a socially just and human rights-based approach where development efforts include all people, even those at the very margin of the society. The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs are both evidently inclusive of people with disabilities. They can be used as an advocacy tool to draw the attention of decision-makers for the creation of disability-inclusive policies and programmes.
Following Nepal’s ratification of the CRPD in 2010, the country has made notable progress in the disability sector. In 2015, Nepal adopted a democratic and an inclusive constitution, which assured a comprehensive set of rights for people with disabilities, with special provisions to ensure their access to health care, education, social justice and proportionate representation in the local bodies.
The Disability Rights Act 2017, which swapped the Disabled Persons Welfare Act 1982, made a vital departure from the welfare-based approach to the rights-based approach to disability. The Act acknowledges the principles on which the CRPD was established, and amplifies the definition of persons with disabilities in line with the Convention, eliminating and banning offensive narratives.
Why is there a need for disability awareness? Simply, disability is not mainstreamed and is often overlooked. Only a few people with disabilities know their rights, and deeply rooted stereotypes towards people with disabilities still exist. Civil servants must make policies to ensure there is more than just nominal representation of people with disabilities in politics.
Within the legal and policy frameworks, governments should engage the civil society and private entities in implementing initiatives to tackle inequalities of accessibility. Engaging people with disabilities throughout all stages of design, development and deployment safeguards access to products and services. This, in turn, can reduce costs and serve wider markets.
The CRPD calls on States Parties to take measures on accessibility not only for government-owned facilities and services, but also in the private sector. In the federal structure, the measures should be designed in consultation with people with disabilities, disabled people’s organisations and their networks, such as the National Federation of the Disabled, Nepal. This will help to break the brutal barriers and open up better opportunities for disability-inclusive development.

303,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-time-for-goods-delivery/,"With the by-elections over, the government must now concentrate its efforts on goods and service delivery to the people
The results of the by-elections held on November 30 send a clear message that the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and the Nepali Congress are the predominant forces at all levels in Nepal, and the smaller parties or independents have little chance of shaking them. Kaski Constituency 2 was the focus of the by-elections, where Bidhya Bhattarai of the NCP, the wife of late Rabindra Adhikari, won the polls with a huge margin of votes against her rival from the Nepali Congress. The seat had fallen vacant after Adhikari, who was the tourism minister, was killed in a chopper crash in Taplejung in east Nepal in February this year. Although some smaller parties, such as the Samajbadi Party Nepal and Sajha Party, managed to win some votes in the election held on Saturday, they were few and trailing far behind the big parties. What is particularly embarrassing is that 19 candidates failed to garner even a single vote, most of whom were contesting the polls as independents. A candidate from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (United) also failed to win a single vote for the chair of ward No. 10 of Kapilvastu. What this points to is that the principles and programmes of these smaller parties do not resonate well with the voters, requiring a total change of tactics in future elections.
The by-elections on Saturday were held in 37 districts for 52 vacant posts. They were held to elect one member of the House of Representatives, three provincial assembly members from Bhaktapur, Baglung and Dang, one mayor in Dharan, three chairpersons, one vice-chair and 43 ward chairs. Altogether 11 parties had fielded candidates for the lone parliamentary seat, 15 parties for the provincial assembly seats and 20 parties for the local levels. Of the 337 candidates contesting the by-elections, 253 represented various political parties while 84 were independents. The polls, despite some sporadic incidents of bomb blasts, were largely peaceful, with 65.43 per cent voter turnout, although the Election Commission was expecting about 70 per cent.
With the victory of Bidhya Bhattarai in the by-election, the NCP retains the same number of seats in the parliament as before. The Nepali Congress, however, managed to wrest the Bhaktapur seat in the provincial assembly from the NCP and won the mayoral seat in Dharan, considered a NCP stronghold. But elections are unpredictable, and they throw up surprises even with the best of predictions. With the elections over, the government is relieved of a major task, especially when there are inimical forces trying to sabotage any democratic exercise in the country. The government must now concentrate its efforts on goods and service delivery to the people. Regardless of any election, the reason why people vote is that they want the government to deliver the goods. And it can only do this when it can spend its capital expenditure in time. Unfortunately, the central government’s capital expenditure in the first quarter of the current fiscal year hovers at around just 6 per cent. The government has the onus to build the infrastructure for creating millions of jobs for our youths, who leave the country by the horde every day to do menial jobs in some foreign land. Let those who were elected in the past or in the by-elections on Saturday not disappoint their voters.

Cancer risks
It’s already unfortunate to be infected with HIV. Now there is more bad news for people living with HIV – they are at risk of cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma, which sees the growth of abnormal tissue in the skin, mouth, nose and throat. People with HIV are also susceptible to lung cancer, cervical cancer and lymphoma, a cancer that starts in the cells of the body’s immune system. According to doctors, HIV weakens the immune system, reducing the body’s ability to fight viral infections, which could lead to cancer.
There is a need to create awareness about HIV/AIDS among the people, especially in the rural areas, to prevent infection as well as diseases as a result of it. Nepal is said to have about 31,000 persons living with HIV, and this gives room for worry as HIV infection could spread fast through multiple means. Most of those suffering from HIV/AIDS are injecting drug users, commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men and transgender people. Also a lot of migrant male workers are known to buy sex when outside, which raises the possibility of infecting their wives upon their return. Working with these groups of people should help contain HIV to some degree.

304,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/my-feathered-friends/,"Early morning after a brief workout I was lying flat on my back, trying to practise a little mindful awareness. Just then I heard a soft sound like stealthy footsteps in my smallish room. It was not exactly dark. Moreover, there’s nothing in my room except books. Just then the sound repeated itself. And what did I see? The trespasser was a beautiful baby bird. In a flash it flew past me, out of the balcony door, into the blue beyond.
On certain holidays, when I’m late waking up, this sound—a clatter of wings followed by a distant cooing – brings me into awareness. I don’t initially see anything except, occasionally, a flash of white, a streak of feathers, but I know it’s a pigeon. My wife then gets to the roof with a packet of wheat. Watching them eat in a group makes me forget my own gnawing entrails.
A couple of years ago, I went to visit the Bengal Dooars. Early morning that day as I emerged out of the hotel room at Jaldapara Inn and stood on the gravel path, I heard the dawn chorus. The car was getting ready to take us to the Jaldapara Reserve forest entry point. Just then, a call I never heard before, sonorous yet melancholic sounded very close to where I was standing. The moment it stopped I felt a pang within. When I got into the car and left the hotel, I was wondering whether I could hear this birdcall again.
I heard the call again after a few hours at South Khayerbari, a Royal Bengal Tiger and Leopard Reserve Centre, about 15 km from Jaldapara. I went on a birdcall recording spree: of the mesmerising four-note call (Bo-Ko-Ta-Ko) of the Bou-Katha-kau (Bride, please speak), the Indian Cuckoo, not to be confused with the Common-Hawk cuckoo, the guide there told me.
Our next destination was Murti. Here you find vast stretches of land, most of which lies fallow, framed by mist-laden hills beyond. And in this open, silent place, how this birdcall, known as ‘the soul of dead shepherd’ calling for its lost sheep, sounded. A brainfever bird (Common Hawk-Cuckoo) hovered continuously over the scape peeping and tweeting in a wailing tone. It must have been looking for its lost mate.
The Indian Cuckoo (Cuculus Micropterus) is a lone bird, whose call is usually not returned by another of its kind. It is very shy and solitary, perches itself at the crown of leafy trees, and hides from the casual gazers. There are other trills, that of a nightingale, or of a lark, which lift the human mood instantly.

305,https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/tia-immigration-and-vny-2020-making-services-swifter/,"Our diplomatic missions have a role in disseminating information about the visa procedures at our airport to prevent unexpected hassles. Unfortunately, tourists cannot make online payment for the visa fee at the airport
Nepal is gearing up to celebrate Visit Nepal Year 2020 (VNY 2020) and hopes to welcome the targetted two million tourists during the year. Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) is the only major gateway for tourists and has the obligatory mandate to provide quick and competent service so that a newcomer enters Nepal with positive vibes and excitement. All of us know that our only international airport is the first impression of our country, which a tourist first sets deep in his or her mind. The immigration office is never unaware of this fact.
However, some tourists complain about the hectic procedure, congestion and unexpected hassles at the TIA immigration. No doubt, sometimes problems may arise due to lack of our effective system or management. But many tourists find themselves in trouble due to their own carelessness, lack of precautions and proper information. Most of the complications tourists face at the immigration revolve around application or payment procedure. When a tourist lands and enters the immigration, s/he must first apply for a visa with the help of a kiosk machine. The second step is to pay the visa fee at the collection counter. During the peak season, s/he may have to go through a long queue, once to apply, then to pay the visa fee and finally while proceeding towards the desk of the immigration officer to get the visa. The problem worsens when some machines abruptly stop working or when the visitor does not carry cash and tries to pay with a credit card, but it does not work in the machines available at the bank counter. Some tourists coming via India have to grasp the nettle when they have no currency other than Indian. Finally, with the limited number of desks open, it is a long way to the immigration desk. These could be problems with some tourists during the peak seasons.

The airport immigration has been suffering from a shortage of officers, and due to this perennial problem, some desks remain closed. An immigration officer can do no more than enhance the work pace only by a little.
Furthermore, the officer cannot overlook the risk posed by suspicious passengers and fraudulent documents while trying to work fast. We don’t have eGates or a biometric system to screen and clear the passengers confidently and on a massive scale.
One thing that prevents us from being efficient is associated with the technology available. The terribly slow network/internet and unreliable power back-up system, even in a sensitive office like immigration, are not new problems. Abrupt interruption even for a minute, for instance, when big jets land within short intervals of time, could send crowds of passengers in the immigration area, which itself is choking with congestion.
We don’t have and don’t expect to have as consistent and reliable technology or system devoid of any flaws as the developed countries. The immigration office alone cannot be better than the condition and level of development of a country, although work at the TIA immigration office these days is far better than in previous times. The airport immigration is undergoing reform in its hardware as well as its software system. We are hoping for dramatic reforms, as our department is working day and night, keeping in mind Visit Nepal Year 2020. And with the operation of another international airport from the third month of 2020, as assured by the minister of the Tourism Ministry, most of the problems, including the one of congestion, might get resolved. Apart from these, some minor precautions on the part of the tourists and some small initiatives by the government could help tourists get easy entrance through the TIA immigration.
First, to make VNY 2020 a success, the government has to make optimum use of diplomatic missions and representatives abroad. Most of the tourists visit as organised groups, facilitated by an international tour company or travel agency. The diplomatic missions and representatives abroad can coordinate, facilitate and share ideas with such companies or agents to escape the hassle at the TIA immigration.  Tourists have the choice of getting their visa from the diplomatic missions abroad before visiting Nepal. Getting the entry permit in the visa already issued is always cozier and swifter than getting a visa on arrival. Nonetheless, if they need to get a visa on arrival, they can at least apply online through online.nepalimmigration.gov.np before leaving for Nepal. The ones who land with an application can directly proceed towards the bank counter of the immigration area.
The diplomatic missions and representatives have a major role in disseminating such information about the visa procedures at our airport and share the best ideas to avoid the unexpected hassles. Unfortunately, tourists do not have the option of making online payment for the visa fee at the airport. In this regard, I urge the higher authority to introduce an online payment system sooner than later.
Finally, the government has to think seriously about supplying uninterruptible, high speed, reliable networking and power back-up system at the immigration. Furthermore, the immigration officials should be given some sort of incentive plans so as to retain as well as to motivate them to work even in adverse conditions and have all counters operate in a full-fledged manner.

306,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/in-new-york-lab-centuries-old-corals-hold-clues-to-climate-shifts/,"PALISADES, NEW YORK: Some 20 miles north of New York City, a team of scientists is searching for clues about how the environment is changing by studying organisms not usually found in the woods around here: corals.
In this undated image, a diver from research unit of scientists at Columbia University led by Professor Braddock Linsley overlooking the Hudson River. the scientists pore over feet-long coral cores they extracted from far-away reefs in the labs of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

In the labs of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a research unit of Columbia University overlooking the Hudson River, the scientists led by Professor Braddock Linsley pore over feet-long coral cores they extracted from far-away reefs.
For Linsley and his colleagues, corals are a precious repository of clues about the past that may help predict future climate trends. They can also reveal how much and how fast environmental conditions have changed during a certain period of time.
Cores are the hard, stony part of a coral underneath the top of the colony – its skeleton. Much like trees, corals produce growth rings that record climatic conditions like seawater temperatures and rainfall as they grow.
In a lab room packed with boxes of coral samples, Linsley and a small team of colleagues cut the cores into slabs and then X-ray the slabs to reveal the annual growth bands.
Using dentist drills, they pulverize small pieces and run geochemical analyses of the coral dust to reconstruct changes in the temperature, salinity and acidity of the water around the coral on a monthly basis going back hundreds of years.
“It is years of lab work and a lot of frustration but once you get to that point, the final product is just so exciting because you’ve got this long dataset,” Linsley said.
Coral reefs develop over thousands of years and are vital to the survival and prosperity of countless marine species. They also curtail flood damage from storms and support human activities like fisheries.
As humans burn more fossil fuel – the biggest contributor to global warming – oceans absorb growing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2).
Some of Linsley’s recent research on corals from the South Pacific island of Tonga suggests that increased seawater acidification caused by excess CO2 could lead to a decline in coral growth rates, endangering the wellbeing of entire reefs.

LOVE AT FIRST CHANCE
Linsley, a tall and soft-spoken 60-year-old, grew up on the Connecticut coast, making dams in the sand and observing erosion on the beaches near the town of Guilford. He loved water and began his career studying ocean sediments and fossils.
His work on corals began after a chance encounter with a colleague who was visiting his girlfriend at the University of New Mexico – where Linsley was studying to get his PhD in the late 1980s – led to a collaboration.
“I was fascinated by the fact that the corals had these annual bands in them and you could potentially extract annual resolve records back several hundred years,” he said at his office in the leafy campus, papers and books scattered on his desk and photos of diving expeditions on the wall.
Corals also brought him closer to the water and he had to learn how to dive, a perk of the job for Linsley.
By studying the environmental records derived from corals, the scientist is hoping to be able to shine a light on issues like the rate of surface ocean warming, ocean acidification and the impact on coral reef ecosystems worldwide.
But one thing is already evident, he said. Environmental changes are happening much more rapidly than in the last several thousand years and they are “clearly linked” to human activity.
Linsley’s childhood home in Connecticut – which he said now regularly battles encroaching waters – stood as a stark reminder.
“My children are 11 and 13. I think about in 50 years from now when I’m not here, what’s it going to be like,” he said.

307,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/remote-island-off-east-timor-turns-sunlight-air-into-drinking-water/,"KUALA LUMPUR: Villagers on a tiny island off the coast of East Timor who have long struggled with water shortages have secured regular fresh supplies, using just air and the power of the sun.
The innovative scheme uses solar power to suck water out of the air and make it drinkable, with the aim of reducing plastic waste and providing the small community on the wildlife-rich island of Atauro with a renewable supply of drinking water.
“The people living on Atauro have not had the opportunity to drink clean water that is not packaged in plastic,” said Rob Bartrop, chief revenue officer at Zero Mass Water the US technology firm behind the scheme.
“For the first time … they have a renewable source of water they can rely on,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Population growth and climate change are putting increasingly intense pressure on the planet’s limited water supplies, with worsening shortages emerging from the Middle East to Asia and Latin America, researchers said last month.
Like many similar islands in the region, Atauro lacks water infrastructure, leaving its 10,000 inhabitants reliant on rainwater and bottled supplies shipped in to meet their needs.
The new project, run with the US non-profit Conservation International, began operating in June and uses a material to absorb or suck water out of the air which is then turned into clean water.
In addition to reducing Atauro’s plastic water bottle waste, the project produces 12,000 litres of drinking water per month.
Zero Mass Water’s technology is now being used in schools, homes and businesses more than 35 countries, but the Atauro project is one of the first to be designed to serve an entire community’s drinking needs.
“We hope that there is a lot of scope to replicate and expand in surrounding parts of the region,” said Bartrop.

While cybercriminals strike at any time of the year, they’re particularly active during the holiday and income tax filing seasons when computer users expect to see more emails — and scammers are increasingly targeting individual small businesses with phishing scams, sending messages that look legitimate but do harm instead. An unsuspecting owner or employee clicks on a link or attachment and like Radin finds that malicious software has invaded their PCs.
Cybersecurity experts find that criminals who used to blanket thousands of computer users in hopes of fooling a handful have refined their methods. Scammers find small businesses through websites, social media sites and by combing email address books. They also mine personal data from breaches at retailers and other large companies. Then, using a process called social engineering, they construct emails that increasingly look realistic, as if they truly come from a boss, colleague, friend, potential client or vendor, a bank and even the IRS.
“In the last year or two they’ve been running more professional campaigns,” says Perry Toone, owner of Thexyz, an email service provider based in Toronto. “It can take a couple of minutes for me to determine that they’re phishing scams. That tells me they’re doing a very good job.”
Radin believes the scammers found her through her website or a blog. Like many small businesses, she has an email address on her site, and the scammers figured out that she might be interested in selling via a holiday gift guide. But finding a target is one thing; the scam won’t work unless it tricks an email recipient into clicking. Even those who are tech savvy can sometimes let their guard down. Radin was duped even though she’s the author of “Everyone’s Been Hacked,” a book sold online.
Often a scam succeeds because there’s just a shred of doubt in a computer user — the email is realistic enough that an owner or employee feels they need to read it. Sometimes a staffer clicks out of fear or a sense of responsibility, says Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College.
“It might not sound very personal, but you have an idea that you should go ahead — you feel like the email is coming from the boss,” he says.
Computer users may not be looking as closely as they should at an email — there can be subtle signs that a message is trouble. Terry Cole, owner of Cole Informatics, a company whose work includes cybersecurity, recalls getting an email that truly seemed to be from a colleague. He was one of several people in the industry to receive it.
“It said that this colleague had sent me a secure private message that was ready for me to read and included a link to click. This was absolutely consistent with my normal experiences communicating with him,” says Cole, whose company is located in Parsons, Tennessee.
Cole didn’t do in that instance what he usually does and advises everyone to do: check the email address to be sure it’s completely correct. When he clicked on the link, it took him to a bogus website claiming to be connected with Microsoft and asking him for his ID and password. He went no further and suffered no damage to his PC.
The holidays provide scammers with extra opportunities: emailed greeting cards, package shipment notices, offers of discounts — all of them false. Cybercriminals also seek personal information from owners and employees under the guise of needing them to create a W-2 or 1099 tax form; at this time of year, business owners’ thoughts are turning to taxes.
“Something that claims to know you, your name, where you work and wants you to take some action is harder to spot,” says Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company based in Sunnyvale, California.
A common scam at holiday time is an email purportedly from the boss telling a staffer to go buy gift cards and email the numbers back, DeGrippo says.
“When it appears to come from a boss or CEO, I think there is that tendency among employees to follow those directions. They’re playing on their emotions,” she says.
Often, a scam succeeds in getting an employee to click on a personal email while on a company PC — many workers check their personal email while at work. Even though the email came through on a personal message, it’s the company’s machine that can be infected.
Companies can protect themselves in part by restricting employees’ access to personal email sites, Telang says. He also suggests seminars to help staffers understand the risks that even legitimate-looking emails can present.
Some of the scams aim at monitoring a user’s keystrokes. So anyone accessing a company or personal account of any sort can be giving a criminal access to their money or sensitive personal data. One tool to prevent a bank account from being emptied or a credit card maxed out is to have accounts with multifactor authentication; that requires a password and a separate code sent to a different device and that is different for each login.

309,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-co-founders-step-aside-as-pichai-takes-helm-of-parent-alphabet/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google co–founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping aside as leaders of the Internet behemoth they founded 21 years ago, ending an extraordinary run that saw them build one of the world’s most valuable and influential companies.
Trusted lieutenant Sundar Pichai, who has run the core Google search business since 2015, will immediately take the reins as CEO of parent Alphabet Inc.
“While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it’s time to assume the role of proud parents — offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!” Page and Brin wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.
Page, Brin and Pichai have shared an emphasis on developing artificial intelligence software to make web searching faster and more personalised, while expanding the range of information and services available from a simple text query.
But their vision faces unprecedented scrutiny, with governments on five continents demanding better safeguards, an end to what many view as anticompetitive conduct, and more taxes from the world’s largest online advertising company. Thousands of employees have protested, and some have even resigned, over ongoing concern that Google‘s famous “don’t be evil” mantra – once embraced by Page and Brin – may be cracking.
Streamlining Alphabet‘s unorthodox management structure could help the company better respond to the challenges and focus on growing profits, investors said.
“This signals a shift away from the more fringy efforts … and more towards a company focused on technology that makes money,” said Kim Caughey Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
Alphabet, which owns more than a dozen companies including self-driving car business Waymo and health care software company Verily, was created in 2015 as part of a restructuring. The Google unit retained control of major businesses including video giant YouTube, the Android smartphone software and hardware operations, and cloud computing.
Page had wanted to focus on developing the newer businesses, which collectively lose money. He left Google, by far the biggest and most profitable part of Alphabet, to Pichai, who in turn delegates a lot of authority to deputies who manage the various product lines. Brin had stayed on as Alphabet‘s president, spending time on robotics, health ventures and other research projects.
But Page and Brin, once regular sights at public events and at Google headquarters, had become much less visible in recent years. Page’s retreat into the background drew increasing criticism from employees and US lawmakers, who demanded answers from him rather than Pichai about controversial projects such as an experimental search app for Chinese users.
Page and Brin, both 46, remain directors of the parent company but will cede their respective CEO and president titles immediately, Alphabet said. The president role will not be filled, it said, describing the changes as long discussed.
Page’s voice has been impaired for years because of a chronic condition, but his health did not play a role in the decision to step aside, Alphabet said.
“With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it’s the natural time to simplify our management structure,” the co–founders said. “We are deeply committed to Google and Alphabet for the long term.”
The co–founders still control the company through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26.1% of Alphabet‘s total voting power, Brin 25.25% and Pichai less than 1%. Alphabet shares rose 0.56% following the after-hours announcement to $1,302.
‘MOONSHOTS’ AND REGULATORS
Page and Brin developed the core Google search technology while they were still graduate students at Stanford, and it quickly proved far superior to competing search engines of the early Internet era.
By the time it went public in 2004, Google dominated Web search and was on its way to becoming a household name and the most powerful force in the global advertising business. The young co–founders also nurtured a free-wheeling, engineering-driven culture that became a model in Silicon Valley, which is littered with startups launched by Google veterans.
Pichai, 47, who has spent 15 years at Google, rose to prominence while leading the development of Google‘s Chrome browser. He later led product development and engineering across all of Google‘s services for a year before gaining the CEO title.
Page and Brin are active in a range of non-Google ventures. Page funded a company attempting to develop flying cars, and Brin at a conference last year discussed a budding interest in cryptocurrency. The Alphabet structure was designed in part to let them pursue new “moonshot” projects.
Investors and regulators, however, were never completely sold.
Alphabet had used the separation between Page’s and Pichai‘s roles to defend its limited financial disclosures about YouTube and other large Google businesses when the practice was questioned by US securities regulators in 2017.
It contended that publicly reported financial results were in line with what Page reviewed as Alphabet CEO. Regulators did not take further action, but the company’s stance has frustrated investors trying to evaluate its performance.
Alphabet declined to comment on whether public financial reporting would change with Pichai assuming both CEO positions.

310,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/for-babies-born-with-hiv-start-treatment-right-away-study/,"WASHINGTON: When babies are born with HIV, starting treatment within hours to days is better than waiting even the few weeks to months that’s the norm in many countries, researchers reported Wednesday.
The findings, from a small but unique study in Botswana, could influence care in Africa and other regions hit hard by the virus. They also might offer a clue in scientists’ quest for a cure.
The Harvard-led team found super early treatment limits how HIV takes root in a newborn’s body, shrinking the “reservoir” of virus that hides out, ready to rebound if those youngsters ever stop their medications.
“We don’t think the current intervention is itself curative, but it sets the stage” for future attempts, said Dr Daniel Kuritzkes of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who co-authored the study.
Giving pregnant women a cocktail of anti-HIV drugs can prevent them from spreading the virus to their unborn children, a step that has dramatically reduced the number of babies born with the virus worldwide. Still, some 300 to 500 infants are estimated to be infected every day in sub-Saharan Africa.
Doctors have long known that treating babies in the first weeks to months of life is important, because their developing immune systems are especially vulnerable to HIV. But an infant dubbed the “Mississippi baby” raised a critical question: Should treatment start even earlier? The girl received a three-drug combination within 30 hours of her birth in July 2010, highly unusual for the time. Her family quit treatment when she was a toddler — yet her HIV remained in remission for a remarkable 27 months before she relapsed and restarted therapy.
The Botswana study was one of several funded by the US National Institutes of Health after doctors learned of the Mississippi baby, to further explore very early treatment.
The findings are encouraging, said Dr Deborah Persaud, a pediatric HIV specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the Botswana study but helped evaluate the Mississippi baby.
“The study showed what we hypothesized happened in the Mississippi baby, that very early treatment really prevents establishment of these long-lived reservoir cells that currently are the barrier to HIV eradication,” Persaud said.
She cautioned: “Very early treatment is important, but prevention should still be our top priority.”
In Botswana, researchers tested at-risk newborns, enrolling 40 born with HIV, treating them within hours to a few days, and tracking them for two years. On Wednesday, they reported results from the first 10 patients, comparing them with 10 infants getting regular care — treatment beginning when they were a few months old.
Medication brought HIV under control in both groups. But the children treated earliest had a much smaller reservoir of HIV in their blood, starting about six months into treatment, the researchers reported in Science Translational Medicine.
The earliest-treated children also got another benefit: more normal functioning of some key parts of the immune system.
One big question: Did the HIV reservoir shrink enough to make a long-term difference? To find out, next year the researchers will give these children experimental antibodies designed to help keep HIV in check, and test how they fare with a temporary stop to their anti-HIV drugs.
In the US, Europe and South Africa, it’s becoming common to test at-risk infants at birth. But in most lower-income countries, babies aren’t tested until they’re 4 to 6 weeks old, said study co-author Dr. Roger Shapiro, a Harvard infectious disease specialist.

311,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/web-inventor-has-an-ambitious-plan-to-take-back-the-net/,"World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee released an ambitious rule book for online governance — a bill of rights and obligations for the internet — designed to counteract the growing prevalence of such anti-democratic poisons as misinformation, mass surveillance and censorship.
The product of a year’s work by the World Wide Web Foundation where Berners-Lee is a founding director, the “ Contract for the Web ” seeks commitments from governments and industry to make and keep knowledge freely available — a digital policy agenda true to the design vision of the 30-year-old web.
The contract is non-binding, however. And funders and partners in the endeavour include Google and Facebook, whose data-collecting business models and sensation-rewarding algorithms have been blamed for exacerbating online toxicity.
“We haven’t had a fairly complex, fairly complete plan of action for the web going forward,” Berners-Lee said in an interview. “This is the first time we’ve had a rule book in which responsibility is being shared.”
For instance, the contract proposes a framework for protecting online privacy and personal data with clearly defined national laws that give individuals greater control over the data collected about them. Independent, well-resourced regulators would offer the public effective means for redress. Current laws and institutions don’t measure up to that standard.
Amnesty International just released a report charging that Google and Facebook’s business models are predicated on the abuse of human rights.
Berners-Lee nevertheless says that “having them in the room is really important.” He said both companies had approached the foundation seeking participation.
“We feel that companies and governments deserve equal seats at the table and understanding where they’re coming from is equally valuable,” he said. “To have this conversation around a table without the tech companies, it just wouldn’t have the clout and we wouldn’t have ended up with the insights.”
The nonprofit foundation’s top donors include the Swedish, Canadian and US governments and the Ford and Omidyar foundations.
One of its biggest challenges is the growing balkanization of the internet, with national governments led by China, Russia and Iran exerting increasing technical control over their domestic networks, tightening censorship and surveillance.
“The trend for balkanization is really worrying and it’s extreme at the moment in Iran,” said Berners-Lee. A strong government exhibits tolerance, the computer scientist added, for “other voices, opposition voices, foreign voices to be heard by its citizens.”
So how to prevent governments from restricting internet access at their borders?
One approach, said Berners-Lee, could be financial pressure. Multinational lenders could condition lower interest rates, for example, on a nation’s willingness to let information flow freely on its domestic network.

312,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/google-reins-in-political-advertising/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google is making it harder for political advertisers to target specific types of people.
The company said that as of January, advertisers will only be able to target US political ads based on broad categories such as gender, age and postal code. Currently, ads can be tailored for more specific groups — for instance, using information gleaned from public voter logs, such as political affiliation.
The change will take effect in the UK in the next week, before the general election, and in the European Union before the end of 2019. It will apply everywhere else in early January.
Google reiterated that ads making false claims are prohibited, adding that so-called deepfakes — realistic but false video clips — are not allowed. Neither are “demonstrably false” claims that could affect voter trust in an election.
But in a blog post announcing the news, Google Ads vice president Scott Spencer noted that political dialogue is important and “no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim and insinuation.”
“So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited — but we will continue to do so for clear violations,” he wrote.
Like all Google ads, political advertisers can also use the broader practice of “contextual targeting,” which involves placing ads about, say, climate change on articles about the environment.
The company is also requiring advertiser verification for a broader range of political messages. Previously, only ads mentioning candidates or officeholders for federal positions required verification. Now that will also include ads touching on state officials and candidates as well as ballot measures.
The move follows Twitter’s ban on political ads, which goes into effect on Friday.
Twitter also placed restrictions on ads related to social causes such as climate change or abortion.
In these instances, advertisers won’t be able to target those ads down to a user’s ZIP code or use political categories such as “conservative” or “liberal.” Rather, targeting must be kept broad, based on a user’s state or province, for instance.
Facebook has not made sweeping changes to any of its ads policies, but thrust the issue into public discussion this fall when it confirmed it would not remove false or misleading ads by politicians.
Critics have harshly condemned Facebook’s decision. Twitter also faced a backlash from those who found its ban too far-reaching.
Google has taken a more middling stance, but it’s unlikely to please everyone. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s campaign staff took issue with reports that Facebook might consider limiting its targeting practices.
“Facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020,” the campaign tweeted from its official account. “Tools that help us reach more great Americans & lift voices the media & big tech choose to ignore!”
Even Google’s limited targeting could receive backlash.
Critics and civil rights groups have said targeting specific zip codes or other small geographic zones can allow advertisers to discriminate or sway elections.
The expansion to Google’s verification process will take effect December 3.

313,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/amazon-says-its-considered-face-scanning-in-ring-doorbells/,"Amazon has considered adding facial recognition technology to its Ring doorbell cameras, according to a letter to a US senator defending its video-sharing partnerships with police.
The company told Senator Ed Markey that facial recognition is a “contemplated, but unreleased feature” of its home security cameras but that there are no plans to coordinate that feature with its law enforcement partnerships.
Markey wrote to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in September raising privacy and civil liberty concerns about Ring’s video-sharing agreements with police departments across the country. The company encourages police to tap into Ring’s Neighbors app, a forum for residents to share videos of suspicious activity captured by their home security cameras.

The Massachusetts Democrat also expressed alarm that Ring may be pursuing face-scanning technology after a patent application showed the company is exploring a system that could flag certain people as suspicious and automatically alert police.
Markey released Amazon’s responses Tuesday.
Amazon’s initial response to Markey said Ring doesn’t currently offer facial recognition. Then Markey sent another letter to Bezos asking why it’s mentioned in Ring’s privacy policy. In a Nov. 1 follow-up, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, Brian Huseman, said that the company frequently innovates based on customer demand and that facial recognition is an increasingly common feature in cameras made by competitors such as Google’s Nest division.
“If our customers want these features in Ring security cameras, we will only release these features with thoughtful design including privacy, security, and user control,” Huseman wrote.
Markey’s questions about facial recognition were part of broader concerns that some lawmakers and civil liberties advocates have about Ring and its police partnerships. Amazon sought to address those concerns in its letters to Markey, emphasizing that camera owners have a choice about whether to share videos. The company noted that police aren’t allowed to seek recordings that are longer than 12 hours in duration or that cover a geographical area that is too specific or broad.
But Amazon also said it doesn’t require law enforcement to delete a user’s video footage after a certain period. Nor would it entertain Markey’s request that it commit to never selling users’ biometric information, saying only that it doesn’t do so now.
Markey said Tuesday that Amazon is not doing enough to ensure that its products don’t run afoul of civil liberties.
“Connected doorbells are well on their way to becoming a mainstay of American households, and the lack of privacy and civil rights protections for innocent residents is nothing short of chilling,” he said in a statement.
“If you’re an adult walking your dog or a child playing on the sidewalk, you shouldn’t have to worry that Ring’s products are amassing footage of you and that law enforcement may hold that footage indefinitely or share that footage with any third parties,” he added.
More than 600 police departments have signed up to Ring’s network since last year and many say it is becoming a useful crime-fighting tool. Among them is the police chief of Markey’s hometown of Malden, Massachusetts. Chief Kevin Molis said he is Markey’s neighbor and has known him since the 1970s but disagrees with him about Ring.
“We consider it a valuable tool for public safety,” Molis said in an interview. “Is it a bad thing that private citizens, in order to make their streets safer, are investing their own money in a product that’s allowing crimes to be solved and crimes to be prevented?”
But staff attorney Mohammad Tajsar of the ACLU of Southern California said Amazon’s responses to Markey raise grave privacy concerns. Amazon told Markey it has no way of knowing if its cameras are collecting personal data from children or positioned in such a way that they’re intruding on a neighbor’s privacy.
“Even if you don’t sell data, or provide data to law enforcement, you’re creating a mechanism whereby people can express latent biases and racism and classism in a portal that encourages it,” Tajsar said.

314,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/china-tests-mars-lander-in-international-cooperation-push/,"HUAILAI: China invited international observers to a Thursday test of its Mars lander as it pushes for inclusion in more global space projects.
The demonstration of hovering, obstacle avoidance and deceleration capabilities was conducted at a site outside Beijing simulating conditions on the Red Planet, where the pull of gravity is about one-third that of Earth.
China plans to launch a lander and rover to Mars next year to explore parts of the planet in detail.
China’s burgeoning space program achieved a lunar milestone earlier this year by landing a probe on the mysterious far side of the moon.

It has developed rapidly, especially since it conducted its first crewed mission in 2003 and has sought cooperation with space agencies from Europe and elsewhere.
The US, however, has banned most space cooperation with China out of national security concerns, keeping China from participating in the International Space Station.
Despite that, China’s ambitions continue to grow as it seeks to rival the US, Russia and Europe in space and cement its position as a regional and global power.
Guests at Thursday’s event came from 19 countries and included the ambassadors of Brazil, France and Italy.
“This event is the first public appearance of China’s Mars exploration mission, also an important measure for China to pragmatically carry out space international exchanges and cooperation,” the China National Space Administration said in a news release.

315,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/should-people-be-paid-for-sharing-their-personal-data-online/,"
LONDON: From tagging photos on Facebook to driving with Google Maps, people should join forces in “data unions” to demand payment for letting online tools collect their data, according to an economist advocating for radical reforms to improve society.
Glen Weyl, a principal researcher at the research arm of US tech giant Microsoft, said people have been “fooled” into handing over data that is then used in artificial intelligence (AI) to copy human behaviour and possibly eliminate some jobs.
“Humans are doing all this work and then we are being told that we are doing nothing, that we play no role, and that these systems are just going to automate us away. This is profoundly dishonest,” Weyl told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“We need to respect the fact that those data are actually being created by the very people who these companies are claiming are no longer relevant. And we need to acknowledge that by compensating them.”
While getting paid for tagging photos on Instagram or uploading to YouTube might sound way off, the idea has been gaining some traction in the United States as tech giants from Google, to Facebook and Twitter, face increased scrutiny over the way they handle personal information.
Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang has said people should receive a share of the economic value generated from their data, while the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, recently proposed companies should pay a “data dividend”.
Weyl said the amount people would get is a matter of debate but it would, in general, depend on the size of the economy that becomes automated, with people getting more money the more jobs are taken over by artificial intelligence thanks to their data.
Estimates vary from $500 a year in a present-day scenario, to $20,000 some 15 years down the line, when some projections say a third of all jobs will be done by computers, he said.
Yet, single users are unlikely to get a penny unless they organise in “data unions” similarly to what workers did during the industrial revolution, said Weyl, a speaker at the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s annual Trust Conference on Thursday.
“People get paid for completing surveys, or putting television boxes in their home that monitor how they watch television,” he said.
“The problem is that the ability of people to receive reasonable and fair compensation for what they do online is undermined by the fact that all these other people are consenting to do it for free.”
Unions could bring together users with specific sets of data, like on travel or shopping habits, and bargain a better price for it, said Weyl, who co-authored the 2018 book “Radical Markets” with legal scholar Eric Posner.
They could also help address privacy concerns by restricting what information is collected and how it is used, he added.
Some early versions of data unions already exist.
US start-up Datacoup offers users a platform to monetise their data, while Dutch group ‘Datavakbond’, or “data labour union”, was set up in 2018 with the aim of negotiating directly with Facebook and Google over data use.
But Weyl said more people needed to get involved or become vocal about the need for a more equitable system otherwise things could slide in the opposite direction, with a few powerful companies and central states controlling most data.
“We can build alternatives to the worst scenarios but those alternatives are not going to come unless we do it together,” he said.

NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew past the snowman-shaped Arrokoth on New Year’s Day, 3 ½ years after exploring Pluto. At the time, this small icy world 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometres) beyond Pluto was nicknamed Ultima Thule given its vast distance from us.
“The name ‘Arrokoth’ reflects the inspiration of looking to the skies,” lead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said in a statement, “and wondering about the stars and worlds beyond our own.”
The name was picked because of the Powhatan’s ties to the Chesapeake Bay region.
New Horizons is operated from Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland. The Hubble Space Telescope — which discovered Arrokoth in 2014 — has its science operations in Baltimore.
The New Horizons team got consent for the name from Powhatan Tribal elders and representatives, according to NASA. The International Astronomical Union and its Minor Planet Center approved the choice.
Arrokoth is among countless objects in the so-called Kuiper Belt, or vast Twilight Zone beyond the orbit of Neptune. New Horizons will observe some of these objects from afar as it makes it’s way deeper into space.

Mercury is the solar system’s smallest, innermost planet. The next transit isn’t until 2032, and North America won’t get another shot until 2049.
In Maryland, clouds prevented NASA solar astrophysicist Alex Young from getting a clear peek. Live coverage was provided by observatories including NASA’s orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory.
“It’s a bummer, but the whole event was still great,” Young wrote in an email. “Both getting to see it from space and sharing it with people all over the country and world.”

The company’s announcement Friday came with a promise that it won’t sell ads using the intimate health data that Fitbit devices collect.
Fitbit is a pioneer in wearable fitness technology, making a range of devices that have become pop-culture accessories, from basic trackers that count how many steps you take each day to smartwatches that display messages and notifications from phones.
They can track activities such as running, cycling and swimming and record heart rates and sleep patterns. Fitbit typically asks for date of birth, gender, height and weight to help with such things as estimating calories burned. Some people use Fitbit’s app to record what they eat and how much water they drink. Women can track their periods.
Fitbit has 28 million active users worldwide and has sold more than 100 million devices.
Google, meanwhile, makes software for use in other manufacturers’ wearable devices, but those products haven’t gained much traction in the face of competition from Fitbit, Apple, Samsung and others. And Google doesn’t sell a device of its own.
The deal to buy Fitbit could give Google a needed boost.
“Google doesn’t want to be left out of the party,” said analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. “If you look at what Apple has done with wearables, it’s a missing piece of the puzzle for Google.”
Google’s pledge that it won’t sell ads using Fitbit health data is a continuation of promises previously made by Fitbit.
Privacy experts, though, were sceptical.
Consumer Reports health privacy expert Dena Mendelsohn said she is concerned that people enrolled in wellness programs through their employers that use Fitbit devices could lose control over their data.
“While a person may not have had concerns about Fitbit holding their data, they may have concerns over Google holding their data,” Mendelsohn said.
Google’s promise is also unlikely to stop it from gathering other information from Fitbit devices.
For example, Fitbit has GPS models that could track users’ locations. That could help Google know that a runner stopped at a coffee shop on the way home. Google could then display ads for rival coffee shops.
More important, having a Google device on the wrist could drive wearers to use Google services, even more, giving the company more ways to sell ads.
The deal is likely to face scrutiny from state and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust authorities, who are already investigating Google and other big tech companies over whether they have abused their market power.
“Why should Google be permitted to acquire even more companies while they’re under DOJ antitrust investigation?” Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, tweeted.
Still, analysts at equity research firm Cowen said they believe regulators are unlikely to block the deal because of Fitbit’s relatively small size and its focus on hardware.
While Fitbit all but created the field, it has been shredded by the competition. It was worth nearly $10 billion after it went public in 2015. But its value this week is well below $2 billion.
When rumours of a potential buyout by Google surfaced earlier this week, Fitbit stock soared almost 30%. It jumped nearly 16% more Friday.
Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet, will pay $7.35 per share. Alphabet stock gained about 1%.
“With Google’s resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone,” Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park said in a statement.
Fitbit has been expanding its partnerships with major health care companies such as Humana to encourage healthier living.
John Hancock announced incentives last year on its insurance policies for people willing to share data gathered by health-monitoring devices. It offers free Fitbits to participants.
Last year, Fitbit acquired a health coaching business that helps people manage conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.
Fitbit ranks fourth in global shipments of digital watches, fitness trackers and other wrist-worn devices, according to research firm IDC. Chinese companies Xiaomi and Huawei were No. 1 and No. 3, Apple was No. 2, and Samsung came in fifth.

320,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/dubai-displays-tech-reputation-with-global-robotics-contest/,"DUBAI: Seeking to bolster its image as a forward-looking metropolis, Dubai hosted the largest-ever international robotics contest this week, challenging young people from 190 countries to find solutions to global ocean pollution.

Event organisers say their selection of Dubai as host reflects a vote of confidence that this oil-rich Emirati sheikhdom can be a global hub for innovation. They also expressed hope that bringing together tomorrow’s scientists and engineers will help develop technologies to solve the world’s most pressing issues, particularly those related to the environment.
Dean Kamen, founder of first Global Challenge, said the Middle East represents a part of the world where “the adults have not learned how to play nice with each other” and it was up to young people to fix humanity’s self-inflicted wounds.
“We are in an accelerating race toward catastrophe, whether it’s global warning, melting of the (polar ice) caps, bird flu, terrorism — you name it, we’re worried about it. The solution to most of the world’s grand challenges depends on better technologies than we have today,” he said.
“This globe of ours is on life support, so the thought is we get every kid in every country to focus on learning how to use technology, but focus on using it as a tool and not a weapon,” he explained.
The unofficial “Robotics Olympics” seeks to encourage young people to pursue subjects known as STEM — science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Teams of four to five students, aged 14-18, each received a kit of rods, wheels, wires and other raw materials with which to assemble their roving robots. Their task: Collect orange balls of various sizes from a playing field, which represented human-created pollutants in the ocean. Some devised robots for scooping, while others snatched up and fired the balls through the air into the receptacles.
The teams then formed “alliances,” each with up of four nations, to battle their way to the final round. Overall, 1,500 students took part.
A team captained by Belarus, and including Syrian refugees, eventually won the gold medal, edging out a team captained by Israel in a dramatic final match. But organisers stressed a message of unity, not conflict.
“The kids get it. To them this isn’t a competition; this is a ‘coop-etition.’ This is a celebration of technology,” said Kamen.
Previous events tackled challenges related to clean water access and sustainable energy.
Robotics is a natural fit for Dubai, a city that’s already testing driverless cars and taxis. It’s become a magnet for international entrepreneurs, with an entire zone called “Internet City” that’s packed with high-tech startups. Next October, Dubai will host the Expo 2020, welcoming technological breakthroughs from around the world.
“If we are to become the city of the future, we need to have the right talent from around the world,” said Omar Al-Olama, the 29-year-old Emirati Minister of Artificial Intelligence, the world’s first such minister. “Artificial intelligence is based on data. Data is what drives all these new technologies. We have the holy grail of data. We have 200 nationalities represented in this country.”
FedEx recently announced Dubai would become the first city outside the US to test Roxo, an autonomous delivery device that can travel on sidewalks and even unpaved surfaces.
Roxo made its debut international appearance at this week’s robotics contest, drawing the interest of the tech-savvy teens hailing from places as diverse as Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. They mingled in Dubai’s Festival City, exchanging experiences and forming friendships while talking shop about their gadgets.
“We didn’t do so well in the matches because we had a lot of trouble with the control hub, but it doesn’t matter, we had a lot of fun,” said Stefan Sijbesma, 17, from the Netherlands. “For me, robotics is really important because it really helped me choose what I want to study and what I want to do with my life.”
The three-day tournament had a festival-like atmosphere to it, with announcers and commentators analysing the action in sports-broadcast style and fans waving flags and banners supporting their teams. The pavilion floor was filled with facts about the millions of tons of pollutants threatening the world’s oceans, and featured slogans such as “united by land, connected by oceans” and “together we turn the tide on pollution.”
As the nail-biting results were being announced, the Israelis huddled with their Ugandan teammates before embracing the winning team in a feel-good ending.
“I can’t believe it, it’s a miracle,” said Yamen Najjar, manager of Team Hope, which represents the Syrian refugees and was part of the winning alliance. “It was a very difficult competition for us, we faced a lot of problems, but we didn’t lose hope.”
Outgoing US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who’d made the original announcement that Dubai would host the event earlier this year in a surprise visit to the World Government Summit, was on hand. Perry said he’s followed the robotics tournaments since 2002 when, as governor of Texas, he attended one of the regional competitions in Houston and was “blown away” by the passions and abilities of the young contestants.
But he said he found their camaraderie even more impressive.
“It is stunning what these young people are doing,” Perry said. “Where the adults may have failed in the standpoint of international diplomacy, these young people may accomplish, and if that’s the case maybe that is the most important thing that comes out of this.”

321,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/dutch-inventor-unveils-device-to-scoop-plastic-out-of-rivers/,"ROTTERDAM: A young Dutch inventor is widening his effort to clean up floating plastic from the Pacific Ocean by moving into rivers, too, using a new floating device to catch garbage before it reaches the seas.

The 25-year-old university dropout Boyan Slat founded The Ocean Cleanup to develop and deploy a system he invented when he was 18 that catches plastic waste floating in the ocean.
On Saturday he unveiled the next step in his fight: A floating solar-powered device that he calls the “Interceptor” that scoops plastic out of rivers as it drifts past.
“We need to close the tap, which means preventing more plastic from reaching the ocean in the first place,” he said, calling rivers “the arteries that carry the trash from land to sea.”
Slat’s organisation has in the past drawn criticism for focusing only on the plastic trash already floating in the world’s oceans. Experts say 9 million tons (8 million metric tons) of plastic waste, including plastic bottles, bags, toys and other items, flows annually into the ocean from beaches, rivers and creeks, endangering marine life in the oceans, including whales.
Three of the machines have already been deployed to Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam — and a fourth is heading to the Dominican Republic, he said.
Izham Hashim from the government of Selangor state in Malaysia was present at the launch and said he was happy with the machine.
“It has been used for 1 1/2 months in the river and it’s doing very well, collecting the plastic bottles and all the rubbish,” he said.
Slat said he believes 1,000 rivers are responsible for some 80% of plastic pouring into the world’s oceans and he wants to tackle them all in the next five years.
“This is not going to be easy, but imagine if we do get this done,” he told his audience of enthusiastic supporters, who whooped, clapped and cheered his announcements. “We could truly make our oceans clean again.”
Slat used his live-streamed unveiling to appeal for support from countries committing to clean up their rivers and businesses prepared to inject funding and help with the operation of the devices.
The vessel is designed to be moored in rivers and has a shaped nose to deflect away larger floating debris like tree trunks. The interceptors work by guiding plastic waste into an opening in its bow, a conveyor belt then carries the trash into the guts of the machine where it is dropped into dumpsters. The interceptor sends a text message to local operators that can come and empty it when it’s full.
Slat showed off how it worked by dumping hundreds of yellow rubber ducks into the water at the launch event in Rotterdam’s port. The interceptor caught nearly all of them.
The machines currently cost about 700,000 euros ($775,600), but Slat said the cost will likely drop as production increases.
Jan van Franeker of the Wageningen Marine Research Institute has been critical of The Ocean Cleanup in the past, but said the new device looks promising.
“I am really happy they finally moved toward the source of the litter,” he said in a telephone interview. “The design, from what I can see, looks pretty good.”
Slat argued that the economic impact of not picking plastic out of rivers is higher than the cost of buying and using the machines.
“Deploying interceptors is even cheaper than deploying nothing at all,” he said.

322,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-plans-to-send-water-hunting-robot-to-moon-surface-in-2022/,"WASHINGTON: NASA will send a golf cart-sized robot to the moon in 2022 to search for deposits of water below the surface, an effort to evaluate the vital resource ahead of a planned human return to the moon in 2024 to possibly use it for astronauts to drink and to make rocket fuel, the US space agency said on Friday.
The VIPER robot will drive for miles (km) on the dusty lunar surface to get a closer look at what NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine has touted for months: underground pockets of “hundreds of millions of tons of water ice” that could help turn the moon into a jumping-off point to Mars.
“VIPER is going to assess where the water ice is. We’re going to be able to characterize the water ice, and ultimately drill,” Bridenstine said on Friday at the International Astronautical Congress in Washington. “Why is this important? Because water ice represents something significant. Life support.”
VIPER stands for Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover.
The rover is expected to arrive on the moon‘s south polar region in December 2022, carrying four instruments to sample lunar soil for traces of hydrogen and oxygen – the basic components of water that can be separated and synthesized into fuel for a planned fleet of commercial lunar launch vehicles.
In development at NASA‘s Ames Research Center in California, the VIPER robot will log “about 100 days of data that will be used to inform the first global water resource maps of the moon,” NASA said in announcing the plans.
NASA is in the process of kickstarting its Artemis program, an accelerated mission to put people back on the moon for the first time since the 1970s to train and prove technologies that would later be sent on a Mars mission.
Scientists have eyed lunar water as a key resource for enabling long-duration astronaut missions on the moon, though its form and exact amount are unknown. VIPER will aim to find out.
NASA crashed a rocket onto the moon‘s south pole in 2009 to confirm traces of lunar water ice in the plume of dust kicked up upon impact.

323,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/facebook-launches-a-news-section/,"
Over the course of its 15 year history, Facebook has variously ignored news organisations while eating their advertising revenue, courted them for video projects it subsequently abandoned, and then largely cut their stories out of its newsfeeds.
Now it plans to pay them for news headlines — reportedly millions of dollars in some cases.
Enter the “News Tab,” a new section in the Facebook mobile app that will display headlines — and nothing else — from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, Business Insider, NBC, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times, among others. Local stories from several of the largest US cities will also make the grade; headlines from smaller towns are on their way, Facebook says.
Tapping on those headlines will take you directly to publisher websites or apps, if you have any installed. Which is more or less what publishers have been requesting from Facebook for years.
It’s potentially a big step for a platform that has long struggled with both stamping out misinformation and making nice with struggling purveyors of news. Though media watchers remain skeptical that Facebook is really committed to helping sustain the news industry.
Facebook declined to say who is getting paid and how much, saying only that it will be paying “a range of publishers for access to all of their content.” Just last year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wasn’t sure it “makes sense ” to pay news outlets for their material.
But now, as Zuckerberg told The Associated Press in an interview, “there’s an opportunity to set up new long term, stable financial relationships with publishers.”
News executives have long been unhappy about the extent to which digital giants like Facebook make use of their stories — mostly by displaying headlines and short summaries when users post news links. A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress this year would grant an antitrust exemption to news companies, letting them band together to negotiate payments from the big tech platforms.
“It’s a good direction that they’re willing for the first time to value and pay for news content,” said David Chavern, head of the News Media Alliance, a publisher trade group. “The trouble is that most publishers aren’t included.”
Zuckerberg said Facebook aims to set up partnerships with a “wide range” of publishers.
“We think that this is an opportunity to build something quite meaningful here,” he said. “We’re going to have journalists curating this, we are really focused on provenance and branding and where the stories come from.”
In a statement, the Los Angeles Times said it expects the Facebook effort will help expand its readership and digital subscribers.
Facebook killed its previous effort to curate news, the ill-fated Trending topics, in 2018. Conservatives complained about political bias, leading Facebook to fire its human editors and automate the section until it began recycling false stories, after which the social giant shut it down entirely.
But what happens when the sprawling social network plays news editor? An approach that sends people news based on what they’ve liked before could over time elevate stories with greater “emotional resonance” over news that “allows public discourse to take place,” said Edward Wasserman, dean of the graduate journalism program at the University of California-Berkeley.
“It deepens my concern that they’ll be applying Facebook logic to news judgment,” he added.
The social network has come under criticism for its news judgment recently. In September, it removed a fact-check from Science Feedback that called out an anti-abortion activist’s video for claiming that abortion is never medically necessary. Republican senators had complained about the fact check.
Facebook says a small team of “seasoned” journalists it employs will choose the headlines for the “Today’s Story” section of the tab, designed to “catch you up” on the day’s news. The rest of the news section will be populated with stories algorithmically based on users’ interests.
That sounds similar to the approach taken by Apple News , a free iPhone app. But Apple’s effort to contract with news organisations has been slow to take off. Apple News Plus, a $10-a-month paid version, remains primarily a hub for magazines; other news publishers have largely sat it out.
Apple’s service reportedly offered publishers only half the revenue it pulled in from subscriptions, divided according to how popular publishers were with readers.

324,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/fossil-trove-shows-lifes-fast-recovery-after-big-extinction/,"NEW YORK: A remarkable trove of fossils from Colorado has revealed details of how mammals grew larger and plants evolved after the cataclysm that killed the dinosaurs.
The thousands of specimens let scientists trace that history over a span of 1 million years, a mere eyeblink in Earth’s lifespan.
Sixty-six million years ago, a large meteorite smashed into what is now the Yucatan Peninsula of southeastern Mexico. It unleashed broiling waves of heat and filled the sky with aerosols that blotted out the sun for months, killing off plants and the animals that depended on them.
More than three-quarters of species on Earth died out.
But life came back, and land mammals began to expand from being small creatures into the wide array of forms we see today — including us.
So the new find taps into “the origin of the modern world,” said Tyler Lyson, an author of a paper reporting the fossil finds Thursday in the journal Science.
The fossils were recovered from an area of steep bluffs covering about 10 square miles (17 square kilometres) near Colorado Springs, starting three years ago.
Lyson, of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, found little in that area when he followed the standard practice of scanning for bits of bone. But that changed when he began looking instead for rocks that can form around bone. When the rocks were broken open, skulls and other fossils within were revealed.
Lyson said it’s not clear how wide a geographic region the fossils’ story of recovery applies to, but that he thinks they show what happened over North America.
“We just know so little about this everywhere on the globe,” he said. “At least now we have at one spot a fantastic record.”

Experts not connected to the study were enthusiastic.
It’s “an unparalleled documentary of how life on land recovered” after the asteroid impact, said P. David Polly of Indiana University in Bloomington. “The sheer number of fossil specimens and the quality of their preservation are exceptional” for this time period, he said.
The fossils’ story certainly represents what happened in central North America and perhaps more broadly, he wrote in an email.
Stephanie Smith of the Field Museum in Chicago said the study’s detailed focus on a single area can help scientists understand the complexity of recovery when combined with results from elsewhere.
Scientists have previously found little evidence about what happened in the aftermath of the meteorite crash, especially on land, said Jin Meng of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The new work, he said in an email, appears to provide “the best record on Earth to date.”
The study reports on hundreds of mammal fossils representing 16 species and more than 6,000 plant fossils. Researchers also analyzed thousands of pollen grains to see what plants were alive at various times. Analysis of leaves indicated several warming periods during the period.
Here’s the recovery story the fossils tell:
The area had been a forest before the meteorite hit, home to dinosaurs like T. rex and mammals no bigger than about 17 pounds (8 kilograms).
Soon after the disaster, the environment was blanketed with ferns and the biggest mammal around was about as heavy as a rat. The world was in a warming period, as documented in previous studies.
By about 100,000 years after the meteorite impact, the forest was dominated by palm trees and mammals had grown to the weight of raccoons, almost as big as before the meteorite crash. “That’s a pretty rapid recovery, or at least one aspect of recovery,” Lyson said.
By 300,000 years, the walnut tree family had diversified, and the biggest mammals were plant eaters about as heavy as a large beaver. Based on other studies of their diet, they may have evolved along with those trees, Lyson said.
By 700,000 years, the fossil record shows the first known appearance of legume plants, the family that includes peas and beans. And it reveals the two largest mammals found in the study, with the larger one weighing about 100 pounds (50 kilograms), roughly like a wolf. That is about 100 times heavier than the mammals that survived the extinction, “which I think is pretty fast” for growth, Lyson said.
What drove mammals to get bigger? The main factor was the disappearance of the dinosaurs, leaving an ecological niche to be filled, he said. But the quality and types of food on the landscape probably also played a role, he said. The simultaneous appearance of legume plants and bigger mammals suggests the plants may have provided a “protein bar moment,” Lyson said.
He said the mammals were creatures that evolved from animals that had survived extinction or those that immigrated from elsewhere.
Zhe-Xi Luo of the University of Chicago, who did not participate in the work, said the report is remarkable for tying together records for plants, mammals and temperature, giving a “holistic picture.”
Scientists expected mammals to recover after the dinosaur extinctions, he said, and the new work “is a huge step forward in getting a firm understanding about just how it happened.”

Able to crack random number problem in minutes
Breakthrough compared to first manned flight
IBM : Google hypes achievement, risks misleading public

BERLIN/SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Wednesday it had achieved a breakthrough in computing research by using a quantum computer to solve in minutes a complex problem that would take today’s most powerful supercomputer thousands of years to crack.

Google researchers expect that quantum computers within a few years will fuel advancements in fields such as artificial intelligence, materials science, and chemistry. The company is racing rivals including IBM Corp and Microsoft Corp to be the first to commercialize the technology and sell it through its cloud computing business.
“We’re hoping that when people start using this and looking at performance stability and cloud interface, they’ll get really excited about what we have to offer at Google,” John Martinis, the company’s chief scientist for quantum hardware, told reporters.
The breakthrough was described in a paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5#Sec4 published in science journal Nature. It followed weeks of controversy since a draft leaked over whether Google‘s claim of “quantum supremacy” was valid.
IBM said a supercomputer employing a different set-up could solve the same challenge in under three days, while chipmaker Intel said “quantum practicality” remained years away.
Google defended its position, but did not dispute rivals’ contentions. It has manufactured a handful of chips with 54 ‘qubits’, vastly more powerful than the standard 64-bit chip in many consumer devices. However, for the technology to be useful to customers it would need to make chips with thousands of qubits.
Martinis said Google sees “a pathway” to a computer with 1,000 qubits and expressed confidence that it had a reliable process to make its new chip, dubbed Sycamore.
The US and Chinese governments have led in the burgeoning quantum technology field, pledging billions of dollars in funding to corporate and state researchers to fast-track quantum development and mitigate possible issues, including the tech’s expected ability to break digital encryption.
Google has been among the beneficiaries of the American support. “The United States has taken a great leap forward in quantum computing,” said U.S. chief technology officer Michael Kratsios on Wednesday.

Long-held dream

For decades, computer scientists have sought to harness quantum physics, laws governing the behavior of particles that are smaller than atoms and can simultaneously exist in different states.
Quantum bits, or qubits, can be set to one and zero at the same time, unlike today’s computer bits that are either ones or zeros. This superposition property multiplies exponentially as qubits become entangled with each other, meaning the more qubits connected, the vastly more powerful a quantum computer becomes.
But there is a catch: Quantum researchers need to cool qubits to about absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius or -460 degrees Fahrenheit) to limit vibration – or “noise” – that causes errors in calculations. It is in this challenging task that Google, which has designed much of its own electronics and used liquid helium for cooling, has made significant progress.
CEO Sundar Pichai compared the achievement to building the first rocket to leave Earth’s atmosphere and touch the edge of space, an advance that brought interplanetary travel into the realm of the possible.
“For those of us working in science and technology, it’s the ‘hello world’ moment we’ve been waiting for – the most meaningful milestone to date in the quest to make quantum computing a reality,” Pichai wrote in a blog https://blog.google/perspectives/sundar-pichai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means.
Sycamore, measuring about 10 mm (0.39 inch) across, is made using aluminum and indium parts sandwiched between two silicon wafers. In their experiment this year, the researchers were able to get 53 of Sycamore’s qubits to interact in a quantum state.
They then had the quantum computer detect patterns in a series of seemingly random numbers, and it succeeded in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. They estimated that the same problem would take 10,000 years for a Summit supercomputer – the most powerful in the world today – to solve.

Hold on a qubit
While the peer-reviewed research has drawn plaudits, with MIT’s William D. Oliver comparing it to the Wright brothers’ first flights, skeptics say Google is over-selling its achievement.
IBM said a supercomputer with additional disk storage can solve the random number problem in at most 2-1/2 days and with greater accuracy. It also said Google risked misleading the public by implying the new-style computers would replace existing ones.
“Quantum computers will never reign ‘supreme’ over classical computers, but will rather work in concert with them, since each have their unique strengths,” Dario Gil, director of research at IBM, wrote in a blog https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy.
Torsten Siebert, manager of the quantum computing research program at Germany’s Fraunhofer Society, agreed that “progress was likely to be achieved through such hybrid combinations.”
Researchers also have expressed concern about quantum computers being used, for example, to unseal secure data and passwords or enable new forms of surveillance.
But before quantum computers can break codes, security experts have plenty of time to adapt, Martinis said.
“We’re pretty confident we’ll all stay safe and secure in the future,” he said.

326,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/is-the-stethoscope-dying-high-tech-rivals-pose-a-threat/,"
CHICAGO: Two centuries after its invention, the stethoscope — the very symbol of the medical profession — is facing an uncertain prognosis.

It is threatened by hand-held devices that are also pressed against the chest but rely on ultrasound technology, artificial intelligence and smartphone apps instead of doctors’ ears to help detect leaks, murmurs, abnormal rhythms and other problems in the heart, lungs and elsewhere. Some of these instruments can yield images of the beating heart or create electrocardiogram graphs.
Dr Eric Topol, a world-renowned cardiologist, considers the stethoscope obsolete, nothing more than a pair of “rubber tubes.”
It “was OK for 200 years,” Topol said. But “we need to go beyond that. We can do better.”
In a longstanding tradition, nearly every US medical school presents incoming students with a white coat and stethoscope to launch their careers. It’s more than symbolic — stethoscope skills are still taught, and proficiency is required for doctors to get their licenses.
Over the last decade, though, the tech industry has downsized ultrasound scanners into devices resembling TV remotes. It has also created digital stethoscopes that can be paired with smartphones to create moving pictures and readouts.

Proponents say these devices are nearly as easy to use as stethoscopes and allow doctors to watch the body in motion and actually see things such as leaky valves. “There’s no reason you would listen to sounds when you can see everything,” Topol said.
At many medical schools, it’s the newer devices that really get students’ hearts pumping.
“Wow!” ”Whoa!” ”This is awesome,” Indiana University medical students exclaimed in a recent class as they learned how to use a hand-held ultrasound device on a classmate, watching images of his lub-dubbing heart on a tablet screen.
The Butterfly iQ device, made by based by Guilford, Connecticut-based Butterfly Network Inc, went on the market last year. An update will include artificial intelligence to help users position the probe and interpret the images.
Students at the Indianapolis-based medical school, one of the nation’s largest, learn stethoscope skills but also get training in hand-held ultrasound in a programme launched there last year by Dr Paul Wallach, an executive associate dean. He created a similar programme five years ago at the Medical College of Georgia and predicts that within the next decade, hand-held ultrasound devices will become part of the routine physical exam, just like the reflex hammer.
The devices advance “our ability to take peek under the skin into the body,” he said. But Wallach added that, unlike some of his colleagues, he isn’t ready to declare the stethoscope dead. He envisions the next generation of physicians wearing “a stethoscope around the neck and an ultrasound in the pocket.”
Modern-day stethoscopes bear little resemblance to the first stethoscope, invented in the early 1800s by Frenchman Rene Laennec, but they work essentially the same way.
Laennec’s creation was a hollow tube of wood, almost a foot long, that made it easier to hear heart and lung sounds than pressing an ear against the chest. Rubber tubes, earpieces and the often cold metal attachment that is placed against the chest came later, helping to amplify the sounds.
When the stethoscope is pressed against the body, sound waves make the diaphragm — the flat metal disc part of the device — and the bell-shaped underside vibrate. That channels the sound waves up through the tubes to the ears. Conventional stethoscopes typically cost under $200, compared with at least a few thousand dollars for some of the high-tech devices.
But picking up and interpreting body sounds is subjective and requires a sensitive ear — and a trained one.
With medical advances and competing devices over the past few decades, “the old stethoscope is kind of falling on hard times in terms of rigorous training,” said Dr James Thomas, a cardiologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. “Some recent studies have shown that graduates in internal medicine and emergency medicine may miss as many of half of murmurs using a stethoscope.”
Northwestern is involved in testing new technology created by Eko, a Berkeley, California-based maker of smart stethoscopes. To improve detection of heart murmurs, Eko is developing artificial intelligence algorithms for its devices, using recordings of thousands of heartbeats. The devices produce a screen message telling the doctor whether the heart sounds are normal or if murmurs are present.
Dennis Callinan, a retired Chicago city employee with heart disease, is among the study participants. At age 70, he has had plenty of stethoscope exams but said he feels no nostalgia for the devices.
“If they can get a better reading using the new technology, great,” Callinan said.
Chicago paediatrician Dr Dave Drelicharz has been in practice for just over a decade and knows the allure of newer devices. But until the price comes down, the old stalwart “is still your best tool,” Drelicharz said. Once you learn to use the stethoscope, he said, it “becomes second nature.”
“During my work hours in my office, if I don’t have it around my shoulders,” he said, “it’s as though I was feeling almost naked.”

327,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/first-all-female-spacewalking-team-makes-history/,"CAPE CANAVERAL: The world’s first all-female spacewalking team made history high above Earth on Friday, replacing a broken part of the International Space Station’s power grid.
As NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir successfully completed the job with wrenches, screwdrivers and power-grip tools, it marked the first time in a half-century of spacewalking that men weren’t part of the action. They insisted they were just doing their job after years of training, following in the footsteps of women who paved the way.

America’s first female spacewalker from 35 years ago, Kathy Sullivan, was delighted. She said it’s good to finally have enough women in the astronaut corps and trained for spacewalking for this to happen.
“We’ve got qualified women running the control, running space centres, commanding the station, commanding spaceships and doing spacewalks,” Sullivan told The Associated Press earlier this week. “And golly, gee whiz, every now and then there’s more than one woman in the same place.”
President Donald Trump put in a congratulatory call from the White House to mark “this historic event … truly historic.”
“What you do is incredible. You’re very brave people,” Trump told them as they wrapped up their spacewalk.
Replied Meir: “We don’t want to take too much credit because there have been many others — female spacewalkers — before us. This is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time … For us, this is really just us doing our job.”
NASA leaders, Girl Scouts and others also cheered Koch and Meir on. Parents also sent in messages of thanks and encouragement via social media. NASA included some in its TV coverage. “Go girls go,” two young sisters wrote on a sign in crayon. A group of middle schoolers held a long sign reading “The sky is not the limit!!”
At the same time, many expressed hope this will become routine in the future.
Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a three-time spacewalker who looked on from Mission Control in Houston, added: “Hopefully, this will now be considered normal.”
NASA originally wanted to conduct an all-female spacewalk last spring but did not have enough medium-size suits ready to go until summer. Koch and Meir were supposed to install more new batteries in a spacewalk next week but ventured out three days earlier to deal with an equipment failure that occurred over the weekend. It was the second such failure of a battery charger this year, puzzling engineers and putting a hold on future battery installations for the solar power system.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine watched the big event unfold from Washington headquarters.
“We have the right people doing the right job at the right time,” he said. “They are an inspiration to people all over the world including me. And we’re very excited to get this mission underway.”
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sent congratulations to Koch and Meir “for leaving their mark on history” and tweeted that they’re an inspiration to women and girls across America.
The spacewalkers’ main job was to replace the faulty 19-year-old old charge-regulating device — the size of a big, bulky box — for one of the three new batteries that were installed last week by Koch and Andrew Morgan. As the seven-hour spacewalk drew to a close, Mission Control declared success, informing the astronauts that the new charger seemed to be working and the space station was back to full power. The women dragged in the broken unit so it can be returned to Earth early next year for analysis.
“Jessica and Christina, we are so proud of you,” said Morgan, one of four astronauts inside. He called them his “astrosisters.”
Spacewalking is widely considered the most dangerous assignment in orbit. Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, who operated the station’s robot arm from inside during Friday’s spacewalk, almost drowned in 2013 when his helmet flooded with water from his suit’s cooling system.
“Everyone ought to be sending some positive vibes by way of airwaves to space for these two top-notch spacewalkers,” Dyson said early in the spacewalk.
Meir, a marine biologist making her spacewalking debut, became the 228th person in the world to conduct a spacewalk and the 15th woman. It was the fourth spacewalk for Koch, an electrical engineer who is seven months into an 11-month mission that will be the longest ever by a woman. Both are members of NASA’s Astronaut Class of 2013, the only one equally split between women and men.
Pairing up for a spacewalk was especially meaningful for Koch and Meir; they’re close friends. They’re also both former Girl Scouts.
It took two decades for women to catch up with men in the spacewalking arena.
The world’s first spacewalker on March 18, 1965, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, died last week. NASA astronaut Ed White became the first US spacewalker less than three months after Leonov’s feat. Women did not follow out the hatch until 1984. The first was Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya. Sullivan followed three months later.
Friday’s milestone spacewalk was the 421st for team Earth.

328,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/us-astronauts-embark-on-the-first-all-female-spacewalk/,"US astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir made history on Friday when they stepped outside the International Space Station (ISS) on the first all-female spacewalk.
The much-anticipated milestone for NASA was achieved during a relatively routine mission to swap faulty batteries on the station’s exterior.
Koch and Meir, clad in white spacesuits and tethered by cords to the station some 254 miles (408 km) above Earth, stepped into outer space at 7:38 am Eastern time (1138 GMT) to replace a faulty power unit designed to help condition energy stored from the station’s solar panels, NASA announced online as it showed live video of the action.
The mission, expected to last nearly five hours, follows a first attempt at an all-female spacewalk in March. It was called off because one of the astronaut’s medium-sized spacesuits was not configured and ready for the journey.
Astronauts on the space station, which became operational in 2000, have tallied 221 maintenance spacewalks, 43 of which included women astronauts, according to NASA.
Friday’s spacewalk, formally called extravehicular activities, is in line with the US space agency’s aim to ramp up inclusivity in space.
Koch is scheduled set to complete the longest single space flight by a woman by remaining in orbit aboard the station until February 2020. She said gender milestones such as the spacewalk are significant.
“There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories from people who look like them, and I think that it’s an important aspect of the story to tell,” she said at a NASA briefing in Houston this month.
Sandra Magnus, a former NASA astronaut who spent 136 days on the International Space Station, told Reuters she did not want events like Friday’s spacewalk to become gimmicks.
“We want them to happen because people have the skill sets and they’re available to do the job,” said Magnus.
“On the other hand, it’s important for young women to see women role models doing extraordinary things,” she said. “So there’s two sides of the coin. You want it to be normal but yet you want it to be special.”

329,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/facebook-ceo-defends-refusal-to-take-down-some-content/,"WASHINGTON: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday defended the social media platform’s refusal to take down content it considers newsworthy “even if it goes against our standards.” But while he promoted free expression, limitations were place on coverage of his remarks at Georgetown University.
Reporters were not allowed to ask questions — only students were given that chance, filtered by a moderator. Facebook and Georgetown barred news organizations from filming. Instead organizers provided a livestream on Georgetown’s social media site and made available video shot by Facebook.
“It’s quite ironic,” said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute and a former state prosecutor. More generally, she said of Facebook, “The key to free expression is to not have one company control the flow of speech to more than 2 billion people, using algorithms that amplify disinformation in order to maximize profits.”
Facebook, Google, Twitter and other companies are trying to oversee internet content while also avoiding infringing on First Amendment rights. The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence. The shift follows mass shootings in which the suspects have posted racist screeds online or otherwise expressed hateful views or streamed images of attacks.
Facebook also has come under criticism for not doing enough to filter out phoney political ads.
“Right now, we’re doing a very good job at getting everyone mad at us,” Zuckerberg told the packed hall at Georgetown.
He said serious threats to expression are coming from places such as China, where social media platforms used by protesters are censored, and from court decisions restricting the location of internet users’ data in certain countries.
“I’m here today because I believe that we must continue to stand for free expression,” he said. People of varied political beliefs are trying to define expansive speech as dangerous because it could bring results they don’t accept, Zuckerberg said. “I personally believe this is more dangerous to democracy in the long term than almost any speech.”
Taking note of mounting criticism of the market dominance of Facebook and other tech giants, Zuckerberg acknowledged the companies’ centralized power but said it’s also “decentralized by putting it directly into people’s hands. … Giving people a voice and broader inclusion go hand in hand.”
John Stanton, a former fellow at Georgetown who heads a group called the “Save Journalism Project,” called the CEO’s appearance “a joke.”
Zuckerberg “is the antithesis of free expression,” Stanton said in a statement. “He’s thrown free speech, public education and democracy to the wayside in his thirst for power and profit.”
The social media giant, with nearly 2.5 billion users around the globe, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of data privacy scandals, including lapses in opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump’s 2016 campaign.
Facebook and other social media platforms have drawn accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that their platforms are steeped in anti-conservative bias.
Zuckerberg recently fell into a tiff with Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, who ran a fake political ad on Facebook taking aim at the CEO. Warren has proposed breaking up big tech companies. With the phoney ad, she was protesting Facebook’s policy of not fact-checking politicians’ speech or ads in the same way it enlists outside parties to fact-check news stories and other posts.
“We think people should be able to see for themselves,” Zuckerberg responded Thursday on the fact-checking issue. “If content is newsworthy, we don’t take it down even if it goes against our standards.”
The social media network also rebuffed requests that it remove a misleading video ad from Trump’s re-election campaign targeting Democrat Joe Biden.
A spokesman for Biden said Zuckerberg’s speech was an effort “to cloak Facebook’s policy in a feigned concern for free expression.”
“Facebook has chosen to sell Americans’ personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans,” campaign spokesman Bill Russo said in a statement.
Several of the students’ questions to Zuckerberg at Georgetown pointed up the conflict. One asked, if Facebook supports free speech, “why is conservative content disproportionately censored?” But another asserted that the policy of not fact-checking political ads is pro-conservative.
“I think it would be hard to be biased against both sides,” Zuckerberg replied, smiling.
Asked about the handling of questions, Facebook spokeswoman Ruchika Budhjara said, “They were submitted by students as they walked into the room. And they’re being picked at random by Georgetown.”

330,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-unveils-new-spacesuit-prototypes-for-missions/,"
WASHINGTON: NASA on Tuesday showed off two new spacesuits tailored for future moonwalking astronauts, signalling the development of a crucial component to the space agency’s accelerated drive to return to the moon by 2024.
Two NASA engineers strutted on a stage inside the agency’s Washington, DC headquarters, donning the new spacesuits, modelling and doing squats and crunches in front of a crowd of students and reporters to reveal what the first zero-gravity space-wear under NASA’s Artemis moon program would look like.

“This is the first suit we’ve designed in about 40 years,” Chris Hansen, a manager at NASA’s spacesuit design office, said.
“What you saw today was a prototype of the pressure garment. The life support system is back in a lab in Houston,” he said. “We want systems that allow our astronauts to be scientists on the surface of the moon”
The Trump administration in March directed NASA to land humans on the moon by 2024, accelerating a goal to colonize the moon as a staging ground for eventual missions to Mars.
One suit of orange fabric will be worn by astronauts when inside the spacecraft. Astronauts will wear a much bigger mostly white suit on the lunar surface.
The new suits make it much easier to walk, bend and squat when walking on the lunar surface, Amy Ross, NASA’s lead spacesuit engineer, said.
“Basically, my job is to take a basketball, shape it like a human, keep them alive in a harsh environment, and give them the mobility to do their job,” she said.
The new suits come as a much-needed upgrade to NASA’s astronaut wardrobe. Astronauts Christina Koch and Anne McClain were slated in March to conduct the first-ever all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station, but the mission was called off because there weren’t enough spacesuits available on the station for both of them.
Another attempt for the first all-female spacewalk, a roughly six-hour crawl on the exterior of the space station to install new batteries, is back on for Thursday, NASA said in a news release on Tuesday.

331,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/despite-defections-facebook-officially-launches-libra/,"NEW YORK: Facebook officially moved forward with its plans Monday to create a new digital currency called Libra, despite several high-profile defections from the project and intense criticism from US regulators and politicians.
The Libra Association, the nonprofit that will govern the currency, officially signed on 21 charter members on Monday at the organization’s inaugural meeting in Geneva. Originally the Libra Association had 27 potential members, but several companies dropped out in recent days, including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal.
Most of the remaining members of the Libra Association consist of venture capital firms, who often have an eye on emerging technologies and align with Facebook’s interests, as well as nonprofits. But some larger companies who are now members of the association include Uber, Lyft, Spotify and European telecommunications company Vodafone. The association said in a statement that an unnamed additional 180 entities have expressed interest and have met the initial requirements to join.
Facebook has faced criticism since the summer when it unveiled plans to create a separate, private currency system to allow users to make cross-border payments more easily. Politicians have said they believe Facebook’s struggles with protecting users’ privacy would spill over into Libra, despite it being a separate organization.
The Menlo Park, California-based company tried to answer those criticisms by creating Libra as a legally separate entity through the Libra Association, and by not owning Libra itself. But Facebook is still involved, even at an arm’s length. The association elected David Marcus, a Facebook executive and co-creator of Libra, as one of the association’s five directors. Katie Haun with Andreessen Horowitz, one of the VC firms that invested in Facebook before it went public, was elected to the board as well.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear in front of the House Financial Services Committee later this month to discuss Libra. That committee is chaired by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, who has been an ardent critic of Libra from its onset.
Facebook and the Libra Association have said they would not start trading or accepting deposits for Libra until they satisfy US regulators concerns. Dante Disparte, Libra’s head of policy and communications, said that the association is now in active talks with regulators to get approval. Facebook has also hired several Washington lobbyists to help alieve regulator and political concerns over Libra.
The other three directors elected to the association’s board were Matthew Davie of Kiva Microfunds, Patrick Ellis with PayU and Wences Casares of Xapo Holdings Ltd.

332,https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-technology/nasa-launches-satellite-to-explore-where-air-meets-space/,"CAPE CANAVERAL: NASA launched a satellite on Thursday night to explore the mysterious, dynamic region where air meets space.
The satellite — called Icon, short for Ionospheric Connection Explorer — rocketed into orbit following a two-year delay. It was dropped from a plane flying over the Atlantic off the Florida coast.
Five seconds after the satellite’s release, the attached Pegasus rocket ignited, sending Icon on its way.
The ionosphere is the charged part of the upper atmosphere extending several hundred miles (kilometres) up. It’s in constant flux as space weather bombards it from above and Earth weather from below, sometimes disrupting radio communications.
“This protected layer, it’s the top of our atmosphere. It’s our frontier with space,” said NASA’s heliophysics division director, Nicola Fox.
Fox said there’s too much going on in this region to be caused by just the sun. Hurricanes, tornadoes and other extreme weather conditions on Earth are also adding energy, she noted.
The more scientists know, the better spacecraft and astronauts can be protected in orbit through improved forecasting.
The refrigerator-size Icon satellite will study the airglow formed from gases in the ionosphere and also measure the charged environment right around the 360-mile-high (580-kilometre-high) spacecraft.
“It’s a remarkable physics laboratory,” said principal scientist Thomas Immel of the University of California, Berkeley, which is overseeing the two-year mission. He added: “Icon goes where the action is.”
A NASA satellite launched last year, Gold, is also studying the upper atmosphere, but from much higher up. More missions are planned in coming years to study the ionosphere, including from the International Space Station.
Icon should have soared in 2017, but problems with Northrop Grumman’s air-launched Pegasus rocket interfered. Despite the long delay, NASA said the $252 million mission did not exceed its price cap. Northrop Grumman also built the satellite.
During a news conference earlier this week, NASA launch director Omar Baez apologized for the delay.
“We wanted to get things right on this rocket,” Baez said. “We have no second chances on these type of missions.”
He called the launch “an awesome and great one; this one’s been a long time in coming.”
Baez said in the end, everything went well. “This is about as good as it gets,” he said.

The batteries power cell phones, laptops, electric cars and countless other devices of modern life, and could become the foundation for a greener future. Batteries that economically store energy from renewable sources like the wind and sun open up new possibilities to curb global warming.

“This is a highly charged story of tremendous potential,” quipped Olof Ramstrom of the Nobel committee for chemistry.
The prize announced Wednesday went to John B. Goodenough, 97, an engineering professor at the University of Texas; M. Stanley Whittingham, 77, a chemistry professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton; and Akira Yoshino, 71, of chemical company Asahi Kasei Corp. and Meijo University in Japan.
“The heart of the phone is the rechargeable battery. The heart of the electric vehicle is the rechargeable battery. The success and failure of so many new technologies depend on the batteries,” said Alexej Jerschow, a chemist at New York University, whose research focuses on the lithium-ion battery.
Goodenough, who is considered an intellectual giant of solid state chemistry and physics, is the oldest person to ever win a Nobel Prize — edging out Arthur Ashkin, who was 96 when he was awarded the Nobel for physics last year.
Goodenough said he is grateful he was not forced to retire at age 65.
“So I’ve had an extra 33 years to keep working,” he told reporters in London, where he was to accept another prize.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Whittingham said he had no inkling that his work decades ago would have such a profound impact.
“We thought it would be nice and help in a few things, but never dreamed it would revolutionize electronics and everything else,” he said.
And in Japan, Yoshino said he hoped the technology could enable greater adoption of renewable energy sources.
“We must create a society where electricity is generated by renewable in order to resolve the climate change problem,” he said.
The three scientists each had unique breakthroughs that laid the foundation for the development of a commercial rechargeable battery, an alternative to older alkaline batteries containing lead, nickel or zinc that had their origins in the 19th century.
All batteries store chemical energy that can be converted into electricity. But earlier batteries were unsafe, too heavy or not rechargeable — limiting their practical use
In the 1970s, Whittingham, who had researched superconductors at Stanford University, was hired by Exxon at a time when the petroleum giant was investing in research on energy storage.
Whittingham harnessed the tendency of lithium — the lightest metal — to give away its electrons to make a lightweight battery capable of generating just over two volts.
By 1980, building on Whittingham’s work, Goodenough had doubled the capacity of the battery to four volts by using cobalt oxide in the cathode — one of two electrodes, along with the anode, that makes up the ends of a battery.
But that battery remained too unstable for general commercial use. That’s where Yoshino’s work in the 1980s came in. He eliminated the volatile pure lithium from the battery, and instead opted for lithium ions that are safer. He added another material in one electrode that reduced the potential for fires.
This step paved the way for the first lightweight, safe, durable and rechargeable commercial batteries to be built and enter the market in 1991.
Whittingham called the prize a “recognition for the whole field,” adding that “hundreds of people have worked on lithium-ion batteries.”
Building on this foundation could enable broader use of renewable energy sources that generate power at variable times.
“Batteries are the bridge between when the sun is shining and when people need to use the energy,” said Amanda Morris, a chemist at Virginia Tech University.
The three winners will share a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award. Their gold medals and diplomas will be conferred in Stockholm on Dec. 10 — the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel’s death in 1896.
The announcement came on the third day of Nobel week.
On Tuesday, Canadian American James Peebles won the Nobel physics prize for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology together with Swiss scientists Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, who were honoured for finding an exoplanet —  a planet outside our solar system — that orbits a solar-type star.
Americans William G Kaelin Jr and Gregg L Semenza and Britain’s Peter J Ratcliffe won the Nobel for advances in physiology or medicine on Monday. They were cited for their discoveries of “how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.”
Two Nobel literature laureates are to be announced Thursday — one for 2018 and one for 2019 — because last year’s award was suspended after a sex-abuse scandal rocked the Swedish Academy. The coveted Nobel Peace Prize is Friday and the economics award will be announced on Monday.
The chemistry laureates said the field and its applications are still a work in progress.
“Lithium-ion itself is still full of unknowns,” said Yoshino.
He said he visits Goodenough nearly every year in Texas.
“For him, I’m like his son,” he said. “He takes very good care of me.”
Goodenough, in his own way, seemed to return the favour, telling reporters that in all of his 97 years: “What am I most proud of? I don’t know, I would say all my friends.”

Three doctors win Nobel Medicine Prize
Their work centres on the hypoxic response
Work paves way for new treatments for cancer, anaemia
Kaelin: heart racing, Ratcliffe: “honoured and delighted”

STOCKHOLM/LONDON: Two Americans and a Briton won the 2019 Nobel Medicine Prize on Monday for discovering a molecular switch that regulates how cells adapt to fluctuating oxygen levels, opening up new approaches to treating heart failure, anaemia and cancer.
William Kaelin at the US Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School said he was overwhelmed to get a pre-dawn call to say he and two other doctors, Gregg Semenza of Johns Hopkins University and Peter Ratcliffe of Oxford University, had won the 9-million Swedish-crown ($913,000) prize.

“I don’t usually get phone calls at 5 am, but I knew this was ‘Nobel Monday’, so it was either going to be a poorly timed mobile call or extremely good news,” he told Reuters by telephone. “My heart started racing. It was almost surreal.”
Ratcliffe, who is also clinical research director at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said in a statement he was “honoured and delighted at the news”.
The scientists’ work established the basis for understanding of how oxygen levels are sensed by cells – a discovery that is being explored by medical researchers seeking to develop treatments for various diseases that work by either activating or blocking the body’s oxygen-sensing machinery.
Their work centres on the hypoxic response – the way the body reacts to oxygen flux – and “revealed the elegant mechanisms by which our cells sense oxygen levels and respond” said Andrew Murray, an expert at Britain’s University of Cambridge who congratulated the three.
“VITAL INGREDIENT”
“Oxygen is a vital ingredient for the survival of every cell in our bodies. Too little – or too much – can spell disaster. Understanding how evolution has equipped cells to detect and respond to fluctuating oxygen levels helps answer fundamental questions,” said Venki Ramakrishnan, president of Britain’s Royal Society scientific academy.
“As (this) work.. shows us, it also gives insights into the way these processes continue to shape our health and wellbeing.”
Randall Johnson, a professor at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute where the prize is awarded, said it was “a prize that really tells us the fundamental truth about how cells work”.
During exercise, for example, the body uses oxygen at a rapid pace, “and this is a switch that helps the cell figure out how much oxygen it’s getting and how it should behave.”
“If you have a stroke there’s suddenly no oxygen going to the brain… Those cells, if they are going to survive, need to find a way to adapt to that level of oxygen,” he said.
Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes given each year. The prizes for achievements in science, peace and literature have been awarded since 1901 and were created in the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.
Nobel medicine laureates have included scientific greats such as Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, and Karl Landsteiner, who identified separate blood types and so enabled safe transfusions to be widely introduced. Thomas Perlmann, a member of the Nobel Assembly, said he had reached Kaelin by phone early on Monday to tell him on the award. “He was really happy, almost speechless,” Perlmann said.
Last year American James Allison and Japanese Tasuku Honjo won the prize for discoveries about how to harness the immune system in cancer therapies.

Canadian-born James Peebles, 84, an emeritus professor at Princeton University, won for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology, about what happened soon after the Big Bang that eventually led to the formation of galaxies and the universe as we know it.
Swiss star-gazers Michel Mayor, 77, and Didier Queloz, 53, both of the University of Geneva, were honoured for finding an exoplanet — a planet outside our solar system — that orbits a sun-like star.
A day of deep astrophysics and talk of extraterrestrial life also included pop humour, with the Nobel Prize committee quoting from the theme song of the American TV sitcom, “The Big Bang Theory,” whose protagonists, Sheldon and Amy, won a physics Nobel in the series finale, and a giggling Peebles referring to singer Bob Dylan.
“This year’s Nobel laureates in physics have painted a picture of the universe far stranger and more wonderful than we ever could have imagined,” said Ulf Danielsson of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in announcing the laureates. “Our view of our place in the universe will never be the same again.”
Peebles’ work is a deeply theoretical look back in time and space at how the universe came to its current form, mostly filled with dark matter and dark energy we can’t even see. It’s probably the first Nobel for purely theoretical cosmology, instead of something observed, noted CalTech physicist Sean Carroll.
Peebles, hailed as one of the most influential cosmologists of his time, who realized the importance of the cosmic radiation background born of the Big Bang, will collect one half of the 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award.
“Much of it will go to charity,” Peebles told colleagues at a Princeton news conference. Then after a pause, he changed that to “Some of it will go to charity. Some of it will go to our children.”
Mayor, who is an astrophysicist, and Queloz, an astronomer who is also at the University of Cambridge in Britain, will share the other half. Their finding of the first planet outside our solar system circling a star like our own made astronomers look harder for life elsewhere in the universe.
“Maybe we can discover some form of life. We don’t know what kind of form,” Mayor said Tuesday as he arrived in Madrid for a scientific speaking engagement. He said scientists “are absolutely certain that a lot of these planets have good conditions for life.”
Mayor and Queloz started a revolution in astronomy when they discovered 51 Pegasi B, a gaseous ball comparable with Jupiter, in 1995 — a time when, as Mayor recalled, “no one knew whether exoplanets existed or not.”
That was “the first step in our search for, ‘Are we alone?'” said astronomer Lisa Kaltenegger, director of the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell University.
More than 4,000 exoplanets have since been found in the Milky Way, and scientists think one out of every four or five stars have planets. “We have 200 billion stars out there in our galaxy alone, so I like our chances,” Kaltenegger said.
Queloz was meeting Tuesday with other academics interested in finding new planets when the press office at Cambridge University interrupted to tell him the big news: He had won the Nobel. He thought it was a joke at first.
“I could barely breathe,” Queloz told The Associated Press. “It’s enormous. It’s beyond usual emotions. My hand was shaking for a long time. I’m trying to digest it.”
Geoff Marcy, who headed one of the teams that rivalled Mayor and Queloz, praised their work. In the 1990s “we were all trying to carry a search for planets without ever thinking we would succeed,” Marcy said. “None of us imagined even finding one, never mind the thousands we found.”
Marcy, who left the University of California Berkeley after accusations of sexual harassment, said he didn’t know if he would have shared in the prize if it weren’t for the scandal.
Swedish Academy member Mats Larsson said this year’s was “one of the easiest physics prizes for a long time to explain.”
That can’t quite be said for Peebles’ theoretical work.
“Jim Peebles absolutely was one of the leaders in trying to understand how did we get here, the nature of cosmology, the nature of the universe at large,” said astronomer Dimitar Sasselov, director of Harvard University’s Origins of Life Initiative.
Peebles’ work, which began in the mid-1960s, set the stage for a “transformation” of cosmology over the last half-century, using theoretical tools and calculations that helped interpret traces from the infancy of the universe, the Nobel committee said.
A clearly delighted Peebles giggled repeatedly during a phone interview with AP, recalling how he answered a 5:30 a.m. phone call from Stockholm thinking that “it’s either something very wonderful or it’s something horrible.”
The astrophysicist, who said his life had suddenly turned topsy-turvy, will make sure he picks up his prize.
“I’ve always loved Bob Dylan,” he said, referring to the singer-songwriter who won the literature prize in 2016 but refused to participate in the Nobel ceremony. “I can’t forgive him for not showing up to the scene of (his) Nobel prize.”
And in a case of life imitating art, Tuesday’s Nobel Prize announcement included the opening lyrics of “The Big Bang Theory” theme song: “Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state, then nearly 14 billion years ago, expansion started.”
The sitcom was a “fantastic achievement” that brought the “world of science to laptops and living rooms around the world,” said Goran Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. So referencing its theme song seemed fitting, he said.
The cash prize comes with a gold medal and a diploma that are received at an elegant ceremony in Stockholm on Dec 10, the anniversary of the death of prize founder Alfred Nobel in 1896, together with the winners of five other Nobel prizes. The sixth one, the peace prize, is handed out in Oslo, Norway, on the same day.
On Monday, Americans William G. Kaelin Jr. and Gregg L. Semenza and Britain’s Peter J Ratcliffe won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, for discovering details of how the body’s cells sense and react to low oxygen levels, providing a foothold for developing new treatments for anaemia, cancer and other diseases.
Nobel, a Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite, decided the physics, chemistry, medicine and literature prizes should be awarded in Stockholm and the peace prize in Oslo.
The Nobel Prize for Chemistry will be announced Wednesday, two Literature Prizes will be awarded on Thursday, and the Peace Prize comes Friday. This year will see two Literature Prizes handed out because the one last year was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy.

MUMBAI: Shimron Hetmyer and Shai Hope hit centuries and combined in a stand of 218 to help West Indies to an eight-wicket victory over India in the opening match of their one-day international series at Chennai on Sunday.
Hetmyer smashed 139 off 106 balls for his highest ODI score and his second-wicket partnership with Hope, who remained unbeaten on 102, helped West Indies chase down a target of 288 with 13 deliveries to spare.
Half-centuries from Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer had helped India recover from a shaky start and post 287-8 off their 50 overs after West Indies captain Kieron Pollard had won the toss and opted to field.
India seamer Deepak Chahar sent back opener Sunil Ambris early and gave the hosts hopes of defending their total on a slow surface at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.
But the partnership between the 22-year-old Hetmyer and Hope ensured the Caribbean side faced little discomfort on their way to victory and a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
While the aggression came from the diminutive Hetmyer, who hit 11 fours and seven sixes, the solidity was provided by Hope.
After Hetmyer holed out in the deep, Hope added a further 62 runs with Nicholas Pooran, who was not out on 29, to take his side home.
Earlier, fast bowler Sheldon Cottrell dismissed opener KL Rahul and India captain Virat Kohli, who scored four, in the seventh over of the innings to put the hosts on the backfoot.
Rohit Sharma also did not last long and was out for 36, leaving Pant and Iyer to reconstruct the innings.
Under-fire Pant, who was not in the best of form with the bat and lost his place in the test side recently, hit seven fours and a six in his 69-ball 71, his maiden half-century in the 50-over format.
Right-handed Iyer, who is India‘s latest choice for the troubled number four batting spot, looked solid and brought up his fourth straight ODI half-century.
Iyer and Pant added 114 for the fourth wicket but their dismissal in the space of three overs robbed India of momentum and ruined their hopes of posting a total in excess of 300.
Visakhapatnam will host the second ODI on Wednesday.

NYON: Thirteen-times winners Real Madrid were drawn against English champions Manchester City while title-holders Liverpool must face Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 following Monday’s draw.
Real Madrid ended up in pot two after finishing second in their group behind Paris St Germain and City were the unlucky team to be paired with them when their name was pulled out at UEFA headquarters.
City, who will be at home in the second leg, have yet to beat the Spanish side with two draws and two defeats in their previous four meetings.
However, their manager Pep Guardiola has a much more encouraging record with nine wins, four draws and four defeats in 17 meetings as coach of Barcelona and then Bayern Munich.
“It’s a difficult one,” said Manchester City’s director of football Txiki Begiristain. “Real Madrid are the best. We want to be the best so we have to try and beat them. It’s always a pleasure to play against Real Madrid. We know them very well. They know our manager.”
Liverpool and Atletico Madrid’s previous meetings have produced one win for each team and two draws with both teams scoring four goals.
Only Europe’s biggest five leagues — England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain — were represented in the draw and 11 of the 16 teams also reached the knockout stages last season.
Both England and Spain managed to get all four of their teams into knockout stages. Elsewhere, Serie A champions Juventus will face French side Olympique Lyonnais and PSG will play Borussia Dortmund.
Barcelona were pitted against an unpredictable Napoli, the first time the two sides have ever met.
Napoli fired coach Carlo Ancelotti immediately after beating Genk to make sure of their place in the last 16 and replaced him with Gennaro Gattuso, who has never coached in the Champions League before.
“A great team, a great challenge, two fascinating races. We will face them without fear,” he said.
Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur side, who reached the final last season, will play RB Leipzig, who are in the knockout stages for the first time, while Chelsea were drawn against Bayern Munich.
Despite their erratic domestic form, Bayern were the only team to complete the group stage with a 100% record.
Serie A side Atalanta, who reached the last 16 on their first participation in the Champions League despite losing their first three group matches, were drawn against Valencia.

RAWALPINDI: Nobody can accuse 32-year-old Abid Ali of not seizing his chances when given them.
Pakistan drew its first test at home in 10 years against Sri Lanka at the Pindi Cricket Stadium after rain washed out more than half of the match, but not before Abid had smashed a century on debut. He was batting at the same venue where Pakistan great Younis Khan scored a century on his test debut in 2000 — also against Sri Lanka.
Abid completed a unique double, becoming the batsman in the history of the sport to score a century in both his ODI and test debuts.
More than 12,000 cricket-starved fans — popularly known as ‘The Pindi Boys’ — enjoyed every moment of the opener’s innings under bright sunshine. He hit an unbeaten 109, featuring 11 fours. Six of those boundaries were his favorite cut shots.
Abid has long been knocking at the doors of international cricket, but had to wait patiently until he got his chance in March this year during the limited-overs series.
A scintillating ODI century against Australia in the United Arab Emirates was not enough to convince the selectors that he was ready for the all-important World Cup in England.
But Abid didn’t lose heart and continued to polish his skills at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore. He was among the 16-man squad which toured Australia for the recent two-test series, but couldn’t fit in new coach Misbah-ul-Haq’s plans. Pakistan returned home after heavy losses at Brisbane and Adelaide, where Abid watched from the sidelines.
Abid’s hopes were raised once again when he was selected for the home series against Sri Lanka, but there were still pundits who didn’t believe he’d get a chance in Rawalpindi.
“I had never grumbled whenever I was ignored,” Abid said. “I have patience. I believed that my time will come … Thankfully I got my chance and what else you could ask for than a hundred on debut. I waited a long for this very day and here I am.”
Only 5.2 overs could be bowled on the third day and the entire fourth day was washed out due to wet conditions.
Bright sunshine welcomed players on the last day and Abid seized the opportunity Sunday after Sri Lanka declared its first innings at 308-6 once Dhananjaya de Silva had scored his sixth test hundred.
Together with Pakistan’s most reliable batsman Babar Azam, who scored his third test hundred, Abid enthralled fans under perfect batting conditions.
Abid, now the oldest Pakistani player to score a century on debut, said he didn’t want to be compared with the greats of the game.
“I am an ordinary player and I can’t match great players,” he said. “I am Abid Ali and please see me as Abid Ali only.”
But one of those greats has already acknowledged that a star is on the rise in the Pakistan team.
“We call him Legend” in the dressing room, Pakistan bowling coach Waqar Younis tweeted after Abid’s century.

340,https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/cristiano-ronaldo-scores-2-as-juventus-beat-udinese-3-1-in-serie-a/,"MILAN: Cristiano Ronaldo is back to his imperious best.
The Juventus forward scored twice on Sunday to help the Bianconeri to a 3-1 win over Udinese in Serie A. Leonardo Bonucci scored the other goal.
Ronaldo also hit the post late on.
It was the fourth successive match Ronaldo has scored in, with the Portugal international having a fantastic month after not scoring in all of November.
Juventus moved back to top of the table, level on points with Inter Milan after a late goal saw the Nerazzurri held to a 1-1 draw at Fiorentina.
Juventus is above Inter on goal difference although head-to-head is the first tiebreaker at the end of the season.
“I played well but the individual performance doesn’t matter as much as the team’s,” Ronaldo said. “We must continue like this, training in the right way and doing good things in the game.”

Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri started Paulo Dybala, Gonzalo Higuain and Ronaldo.
“Right now, the front three are doing very well,” Sarri said. “We did well for a long stretch, and today we could afford to play this ‘trident’.
“This is an extraordinary solution, but to be kept in mind at certain times during the games and the season.”
It took just nine minutes for Juventus to open the scoring as Dybala chested down Bonucci’s pass from his own half and flicked the ball on for Ronaldo to fire into the bottom right corner.
Despite a number of chances it took Juventus until the 37th minute to double its tally when Ronaldo drove home Higuain’s through-ball.
Bonucci headed in the third on the stroke of halftime.
Udinese scored a stoppage-time consolation through Ignacio Pussetto.

TEENAGE RESCUER
Teenager Dušan Vlahović scored a stunning solo goal in stoppage time to possibly save the job of Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella and add to Inter’s miserable week.
The 19-year-old Vlahović raced from inside his own half before hitting the ball across the face of goal and into the far top corner.
It ended a run of four successive defeats for Fiorentina.
“It’s an important draw,” Montella said. “The team had a great game, losing would have been unfair. There was a desire to have a great performance … It was a great goal from Dusan. I’m happy for him, he will go far because he has the desire to work and to suffer. We are working on this kid. I put my faith in him last year too.”
It was the third time in four matches against Inter that Fiorentina has scored a stoppage-time equalizer.
Former Fiorentina hero Borja Valero had scored the opener in the eight minute, gathering Marcelo Brozovic’s throughball and turning Nikola Milenkovic inside out before shooting into the near bottom corner from close range.
Valero, who joined Inter in 2017 after five years at Fiorentina and has the coordinates of the city tattooed on his arm, didn’t celebrate and instead raised his arm in apology.
Lautaro Martínez thought he had doubled Inter’s lead with his sixth goal in as many matches but it was ruled out as Romelu Lukaku had been marginally offside in the buildup.
Home goalkeeper Bartlomiej Dragowski also pulled off a great save to deny Lukaku as Inter failed to bounce back from its defeat to Barcelona and becoming the only Italian team not to progress to the last 16 of the Champions League.
“Just like against Barcelona, we got less than we deserved,” Inter coach Antonio Conte said. “It’s disappointing because today the team responded well after Tuesday’s defeat.
“It’s a process of growth and we have to all be patient, because we’re still not in the conditions to win every match just because we’re called Inter.”

OTHER MATCHES
Hellas Verona fought back from three goals down to draw 3-3 against Torino.
Torino was 3-0 up after an hour but all three Verona substitutes scored in a 15-minute spell to secure an improbable point.
Atalanta was surprisingly beaten 2-1 at Bologna, which had defender Danilo sent off two minutes from time.
Atalanta remained sixth but fell four points behind the Champions League spots after Roma fought back from a goal down to beat bottom-place Spal 3-1.
Cagliari can move back into fourth if it wins at home to third-place Lazio on Monday.

341,https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/arsenal-man-city-game-removed-from-broadcast-schedule-by-china-state-tv-report/,"SHANGHAI: China’s state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday removed Arsenal’s Premier League game against Manchester City from its broadcast schedule following Mesut Ozil’s messages that criticised the country’s policy towards its Muslim Uighur minority.
The Global Times Newspaper said on its Twitter account on Sunday that CCTV took the decision after midfielder Ozil’s comments on Saturday had “disappointed fans and football governing authorities”.
Ozil’s posts called Uighurs “warriors who resist persecution” and criticised both China’s crackdown and the silence of Muslims in response.
“(In China) Qurans are burned, mosques were closed down, Islamic theological schools, madrasas were banned, religious scholars were killed one by one. Despite all this, Muslims stay quiet,” Ozil, who is a Muslim, said in his posts.
An Arsenal spokesman told Reuters that they had no official statement on the issue after CCTV’s decision to show a taped game between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers instead of the originally planned fixture.
CCTV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Arsenal on Saturday tried to distance itself from Ozil’s comments after he posted messages on Twitter and Instagram.
“The content he expressed is entirely Ozil’s personal opinion,” the official account of Arsenal said in a post on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform.
“As a football club, Arsenal always adheres to the principle of not being involved in politics.”
The club’s Twitter account did not have a post addressing Ozil’s comments as of Sunday morning.
Replies to Arsenal’s Weibo post were angry, with one showing a shredded Ozil soccer jersey next to a pair of scissors and others demanding he be expelled from the club.
A search on Weibo for the hashtag translatable as “Ozil issues inappropriate statement”, which had been one of the top trending topics on the platform, returned no results on Saturday afternoon.
Weibo frequently censors discussion of sensitive topics, particularly amid a push by Beijing to clean up its internet.
The Chinese Football Association told government-backed news outlet, The Paper, on Saturday it was “outraged and disappointed” by Ozil’s remarks, describing them as “inappropriate”.
“Ozil’s comments are undoubtedly hurtful to the Chinese fans who closely follow him, and at the same time his comments also hurt the feelings of Chinese people. This is something we cannot accept,” the news outlet quoted an unnamed official from the association as saying.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions in Xinjiang as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign.
China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs.

Unfortunately, it may not be for the goals scored by Lionel Messi’s Barcelona or Karim Benzema’s Real Madrid.
Catalan separatists are planning to gather in large numbers around the Camp Nou and possibly carry out actions inside Barcelona’s stadium on Wednesday when Real Madrid comes to play in one of the most watched matches of the season.
More than 25,000 protesters have agreed to gather outside Camp Nou, according to the on-line separatist platform Tsunami Democratic. The group says there will also be protesters among the spectators at the 99,000-seat stadium.
Police have prepared a 3,000-strong special detail involving police and private security staff to try to ensure that the team buses can arrive on time and that nothing interrupts the match.
The match was already postponed from its original date on Oct. 26 because of fears that separatists, then in the midst of a week of violent protests, would disrupt the game.
The clubs are level at the top of the Spanish standings ahead of the game after a weekend in which both were held to draws. Barcelona was held 2-2 at Real Sociedad on Saturday, and Madrid needed a last-gasp goal by Benzema to draw 1-1 at Valencia on Sunday.

CRAZY CLÁSICOS
Besides several thrilling showdowns between the powerhouse clubs, this century has seen some highly-charged clásicos in Barcelona that got out of control.
The most outlandish was former Barcelona star Luis Figo’s return in a Madrid kit in 2000. The Portugal forward was welcomed by a showering of trash, including a pig’s head, at him by his spurned former fans.
A close second place goes to ex-Madrid manager Jose Mourinho poking then Barcelona assistant Tito Vilanova in the eye during a mass brawl between the teams in 2011.

BARCELONA DOMINANCE
Barcelona hasn’t lost a game to Madrid in six consecutive league meetings, while Madrid’s last win at Camp Nou in the league was in April 2014.
Last season, Barcelona routed Madrid 5-1 without the injured Messi. Madrid then drew 1-1 at Barcelona in the Copa del Rey, only to lose 3-0 in the second leg at home.

BARCA’S GRIEZMANN
Barcelona spent 120 million euros ($134 million) this summer to trigger the escape clause in Antoine Griezmann’s contract with Atlético Madrid with the hope of finding a third world-class scoring talent after Philippe Coutinho failed to fit the bill.
Just in time for Madrid, Griezmann has found his scoring form after struggling to adapt to his new role at Barcelona in the opening months of the season.
The French World Cup winner has scored three times in his last five games and has tallied seven goals on the campaign. Equally as important, he is clicking well with Messi and Luis Suárez, with all three combining for 33 goals. Griezmann scored in Saturday’s draw at former club Sociedad.
“It was always nice to watch the clásicos on television, and now I can fulfill the dream of playing in one,” Griezmann said on Sunday.
Messi will be looking to increase his clásico record of 26 goals.

MADRID’S BENZEMA
Benzema will be the No. 1 threat for Madrid.
The French striker leads Madrid with 16 goals in all competitions this season and leads the Spanish league along with Messi with 12 strikes.
Who will accompany Benzema in Madrid’s frontline is more of a mystery.
With Eden Hazard most likely unavailable because of a leg injury, Zidane could align Gareth Bale, Francisco “Isco” Alarcón, Lucas Vázquez or Brazilian youngsters Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior.

TOKYO: Two-time grand slam winner Naomi Osaka has appointed Belgian Wim Fissette as coach, Kyodo news agency on Sunday quoted the Japanese player’s management as saying, as she gears up to defend her Australian Open title.
Osaka has been without a coach since September, when she split with Jermaine Jenkins following a disappointing defence of her US Open title.
Jenkins was himself a replacement for Sascha Bajin, who Osaka ditched in February, weeks after winning her first major at Melbourne Park.
She subsequently suffered early exits at the French Open and Wimbledon.
Former professional Fissette, 39, guided compatriot Kim Clijsters to three grand slam titles between 2009 and 2011 and has also worked with major winners Simona Halep, Petra Kvitova and Angelique Kerber.
Osaka’s 2019 win Down Under, after her breakthrough U.S. Open title, made her Asia’s first world number one and the first player of any nation to claim their first two Grand Slam titles back-to-back since Jennifer Capriati in 2001.
Now ranked third, Osaka had her father filling in as coach following the split with Jenkins.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice to set yet another goalscoring landmark and help Juventus to a 3-1 home win over Udinese on Sunday that sent them back to the top of the Serie A table.
In-form Ronaldo, who has five goals in his last four games, took his tally for the season to 11 in 19 appearances, becoming the only player in Europe’s top five leagues to hit double figures in all competitions in each of the last 15 seasons.

The Portuguese struck twice in the first half before Leonardo Bonucci headed in Juve’s third on the brink of halftime.
Ignacio Pussetto netted a consolation for the visitors late in the game.
“The most important thing was to win,” Ronaldo told Sky Sport Italia.
“This is how we should play, with confidence. Individual performances aren’t what matters, but the collective effort.”
Juventus suffered their first defeat of the season at Lazio last weekend to surrender the lead to Inter Milan, but the champions put pressure back on Antonio Conte’s side by moving one point clear at the top with victory at the Allianz Stadium.
Maurizio Sarri’s side have 39 points, but Inter can regain first place by beating Fiorentina away in the late game on Sunday.
Udinese remain in relegation trouble after falling to 17th place on 15 points, hovering just two points above the drop zone.
Gianluigi Buffon started in goal for Juventus to match Alessandro Del Piero’s club record of 478 Serie A appearances, while Ronaldo was given the rare opportunity to start in an attacking trident alongside Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain.
They needed just nine minutes to find the breakthrough when Dybala’s deflected shot fell into the path of Ronaldo, who fired in a low finish from the edge of the box.
After Dybala looked to have made it 2-0 with a sublime lob only for it to be ruled out for handball in the build-up, Ronaldo scored again after 37 minutes, latching on to Higuain’s through ball to smash a shot into the bottom corner.
The game was over as a contest by half time after Merih Demiral rose to head a corner towards the six-yard box, where Bonucci was on hand to nod in off the crossbar.
Ronaldo came close to a hat-trick in the second half when his powerful shot was palmed onto the post by Udinese goalkeeper Juan Musso.
The excellent Buffon was denied a clean sheet at the death when Pussetto prodded in from close range.
Elsewhere, European hopefuls Atalanta lost 2-1 at Bologna to miss out on the chance to move into the top four.
Gian Piero Gasperini’s side remain sixth after goals from Rodrigo Palacio and Andrea Poli put Bologna in command before Ruslan Malinovskiy pulled one back.
Hellas Verona completed a remarkable fightback against Torino as they recovered a three-goal deficit to draw 3-3, with all three substitutes scoring inside the final 21 minutes for the home side.
Two goals from Cristian Ansaldi either side of Alex Berenguer’s strike gave Torino a handsome lead, but Giampaolo Pazzini pulled one back from the penalty spot on 69 minutes before Valerio Verre and Mariusz Stepinski also found the net.

Tottenham Hotspur winger Lucas Moura’s brilliant solo strike and defender Jan Vertonghen’s late header sealed a 2-1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in an entertaining Premier League game at Molineux Stadium on Sunday.
It was Tottenham’s fourth league victory in five games under Jose Mourinho since the Portuguese took over last month and the result also snapped Wolves’ impressive 11-game unbeaten run in the competition.

Tottenham got off to the perfect start in the eighth minute when the lively Moura drifted past several Wolves defenders and smashed in a fierce right-footed shot that gave goalkeeper Rui Patricio no chance at the near post.
Vertonghen, who endured a torrid afternoon due to wave after wave of Wolves attacks, popped up for the winning goal in the first minute of stoppage time with a fine header from Christian Eriksen’s corner to seal all three points for the visitors.
Wolves had earlier responded in emphatic fashion in the 67th minute when Adama Traore fired in from distance for his fourth league goal of the campaign, after the hosts had relentlessly pushed for an equaliser on a rainy afternoon.
Spurs could have earlier doubled their advantage in the 37th minute, but Eric Dier dragged a shot wide from close range and only managed to hit the outside of the post after Patricio had failed to clear his lines.
Victory on a testing day lifted Tottenham to fifth in the standings on 26 points, three behind fourth-placed Chelsea who they host next Sunday.
“We knew the game was going to be difficult. They didn’t catch us by surprise. We had a good start like we tried to. We almost scored a second but against Wolves that wouldn’t have killed the game,” Mourinho told the BBC.
“They’re strong. They use the sides, the centre, difficult in transition. Traore and Diogo Jota are incredibly fast and difficult to stop.
“We coped with their spirit. At 1-1 they tried, Wolves aren’t a team satisfied with a point. We knew if we arrive in the last part we could score. After that we had to close the door… three incredible points.”
Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo said he was happy with the team’s attacking performance but not their defending.
“We played very good. We weren’t perfect, almost. We should have defended better… I’m pleased with the boys,” Santo said.
“Spurs are a very good team. We broke them many times… the final moments require a lot of focus… we were more obsessed about scoring than defending.”

LONDON: Manchester City resumed normal service in the Premier League as a masterful display by Kevin De Bruyne fired them to a 3-0 victory over a listless Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday.

Belgian De Bruyne produced two sublime finishes and one silky assist for Raheem Sterling as Pep Guardiola’s City killed the match as a contest before halftime.
Arsenal managed to avoid any more punishment in the second half as City switched on cruise control but it was an uncomfortable 90 minutes for their stand-in manager Freddie Ljungberg whose side were totally outclassed.
There was no big celebration by the travelling City fans as the champions, who dropped eight points in their previous five games, remain 14 points behind runaway leaders Liverpool.
They did, however, close the gap on second-placed Leicester City to four points ahead of their clash next week.
Arsenal managed only six shots — their lowest total at home in the Premier League since 2008 — and are ninth with 22 points, seven points adrift of the top four and showing little sign that things will improve anytime soon.
Ljungberg has managed only one win from five games in interim charge since Unai Emery was sacked and midway through the season the north London club appear rudderless — as close to the relegation zone as the top four.
Impressive as City were, Guardiola said last week’s performance in losing 2-1 to Manchester United was better.
“Against United we played much better,” the Spaniard, in charge of his 200th match for City, said. “I know we are judged on the result but I have a duty to judge the performance, not just the result.”
It is now six home games without a win for Arsenal in all competitions, yet they almost took the lead in the opening minute when Gabriel Martinelli burst through.
A minute later, however, they were behind as City counter-attacked and Gabriel Jesus cut the ball back from the byline to an unmarked De Bruyne who belted a stunning side-footed finish into the roof of the net from just outside the penalty area.
City were two up in the 16th minute and again they sliced through Arsenal with alarming ease. De Bruyne swapped passes with Jesus and then picked out Sterling who was all on his own to calmly dispatch the ball past Bernd Leno.
Shortly before halftime, with Arsenal briefly down to 10 men as left back Sead Kolasinac limped off, City made it 3-0 with De Bruyne again given time and space to pick his spot, this time passing a sublime left-foot finish just inside the post.
Many Arsenal fans headed for an early halftime coffee, or perhaps home, and missed a superb save by Leno to deny the outstanding De Bruyne a first-half hat-trick, clawing the Belgian’s bending effort against the post.
City could and should have scored more after the break, despite taking their foot off the accelerator, while for a chastened Arsenal it was simply a case of damage-limitation.
The last time they experienced such a long run without a home win was 1994-95.

MANCHESTER: Youngster Mason Greenwood continued his good run of form as he struck a late equaliser for Manchester United in their 1-1 Premier League home draw with Everton on Sunday after a Victor Lindelof own-goal had put the visitors ahead.
The 18-year-old striker, who netted a brace in United‘s 4-0 Europa League win over Dutch side AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, came on for Jesse Lingard midway through the second half and levelled with a crisp shot in the 77th minute.
Everton, who were on the back foot and had goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to thank for keeping United at bay, took a 36th-minute lead when home keeper David De Gea misjudged a Leighton Baines corner and the ball cannoned in off Lindelof.
The goal was awarded after a quick Video Assistant Referee (VAR) check as Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin had made contact with De Gea in the six-yard box.
United missed a string of chances as Lingard dragged his shot wide from close range 15 seconds into the game before Pickford parried a swivelling Rashford free kick and then a stinging low drive from Luke Shaw.
Both sides could have grabbed a winner in the closing stages as Pickford kept out another vicious Rashford free kick before Alex Iwobi had Dea Gea at full stretch at the other end.

LONDON: Chelsea suffered a dispiriting 1-0 loss at home to Bournemouth as a late Dan Gosling goal secured all three points for the visitors to end their five-match losing streak and condemn the London side to a fourth defeat in five Premier League games.
Gosling, making his first start of the season, was left alone as Chelsea‘s defence rushed out and he looped a shot high over goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga in the 84th minute.
Although the linesman raised his flag for offside, referee Graham Scott awarded the goal after a lengthy VAR check.
Chelsea remain fourth with 29 points from 17 games, while Bournemouth rose to 14th on 19, four points above the relegation zone after their third win in five visits to Stamford Bridge.
The hosts looked off the pace after qualifying for the Champions League knockout stages with a nervy 2-1 home win against Lille on Tuesday.
They had over 60% possession and buzzed around the penalty area to create chances for Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Christian Pulisic but struggled to create clear opportunities against a side missing several key players through injury.
Cherries’ keeper Aaron Ramsdale pulled off fine reaction saves in each half from midfielder Mount and full back Emerson to keep the south-coast side in the game before Gosling’s goal delighted the travelling fans on a chilly afternoon.
Chelsea coach Frank Lampard said the defeat, after recent losses to West Ham United and Everton, was a reality check for his young players who had racked up a string of wins earlier in the season with attack-minded football.
“If we’re not at our best, if we’re not able break teams down that are organised… then we need to find another way,” he said, dismissing suggestions from a reporter that a flat mood among the home fans contributed to the loss.
“Some responsibility is on the players to excite them, to have the personality and the balls to take the ball in an area and beat someone or play forward,” said Lampard who suggested this week he wanted a striker in the January transfer window.
By contrast, Bournemouth coach Eddie Howe was full of praise for his team’s battling spirit.
“That’s the best we’ve fought, the best we’ve competed, the most desire I’ve seen from the group,” he said.

MUNICH: Bayern Munich‘s Philippe Coutinho scored a hat-trick and Robert Lewandowski added two more goals as the champions demolished Werder Bremen 6-1 on Saturday to impressively bounce back from two straight league defeats.
The Bavarians, missing several players through injury, climbed to fourth place on 27 points, six behind RB Leipzig, who beat Fortuna Duesseldorf 3-0 to climb to the top of the Bundesliga on 33 points.
Borussia Moenchengladbach, on 31, can reclaim the lead with a win at VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday.
Borussia Dortmund stayed two points ahead of Bayern in third after a 4-0 win at Mainz 05 but Bayer Leverkusen missed a chance to move into the top four after suffering a shock 2-0 defeat at strugglers Cologne and instead dropped to seventh on 25.
Bayern‘s man-of-the-match Coutinho, who also helped set up two more goals, delivered at just the right time with the Bavarians, struggling to find their rhythm under interim coach Hansi Flick, were at risk of losing touch with the top spots.
The Brazilian forward, brought in on loan from Barcelona this season, scored his first Bundesliga treble with Bayern playing a dominant second half.
“Everyone in the stadium today enjoyed themselves,” a relieved Flick told reporters. “That was really good. We are delighted with the players’ performance today and his (Coutinho’s).
“We showed character when we turned the game before the break.”
However, Bayern fell behind in the 24th minute to a Milot Rashica goal after they missed golden chances, including top scorer Lewandowski, as had been the case in recent weeks.
But their wastefulness was not punished this time as goals from Coutinho in the 45th minute, and Lewandowski in first-half stoppage time, turned the game for the hosts.
Brazilian Coutinho then chipped a superb David Alaba pass over Bremen keeper Jiri Pavlenka for their third goal in the 63rd as Bayern completely bossed the game following the break.
Poland forward Lewandowski added a fifth after 72 minutes to take his league total to 18 goals, and Thomas Mueller also scored before Coutinho rounded off a fine performance with another goal to complete his hat-trick.
Leipzig had a little tougher task at Fortuna despite taking a second minute lead through Patrik Schick and dominating the first half.
Timo Werner netted his 16th goal of the campaign, converting a 58th minute penalty, to settle their nerves after the hosts had hit the post. Nordi Mukiele added a third in the 75th minute to seal their sixth consecutive league win.

PERTH: Australia cleaned up a hapless New Zealand under lights on the fourth day to secure a commanding 296-run victory in the first test on Sunday.
Chasing a record 468 runs, New Zealand crumbled against sustained bowling from Australia’s undermanned attack and were bowled out for 171 in a lopsided contest.
A rejuvenated Australia have won their third straight test of the home season since retaining the Ashes in England and stretched their unbeaten run in day-night matches to seven.
BJ Watling (40) and Colin de Grandhomme (33) stonewalled in a bid to stretch the test into a final day, but their dismissals triggered a swift end. Quick Mitchell Starc and spinner Nathan Lyon claimed four wickets apiece.
The tourists’ chase on a deteriorating Perth Stadium pitch got off to a disastrous start when opener Jeet Raval and Kane Williamson (14) fell before the tea break.
Lyon picked up the prized wicket of Williamson with his first ball as the New Zealand skipper meekly poked to short leg.
Raval made just one for the second time in the match, falling to a sharp Starc delivery.
Ross Taylor, who top-scored with 80 in New Zealand’s first innings, stonewalled alongside Tom Latham before losing patience and edging an attempted pull shot off Starc for 22.
Latham soon departed for 18 when he was trapped lbw by Lyon in a decision overturned on review.
Watling had luck on 27 when he was given not out after a loud appeal for caught behind off Lyon. Replays showed he had edged the ball but Australia declined to review. He then was dropped on 30 by Steve Smith at slip.
Smith, however, made no mistake when De Grandhomme edged a fierce short ball from Cummins.
Watling’s charmed life ended when he gloved a short delivery from Starc in a decision overturned on review to effectively signal the end of New Zealand’s resistance.
Australia dominated throughout with their formidable first innings total setup by a majestic 143 from Marnus Labuschagne in his third straight ton. Starc, who was sidelined for most of the Ashes series, overwhelmed New Zealand with a nine-wicket haul.
Both teams were without a paceman after debutant Lockie Ferguson, himself a replacement for injured New Zealand spearhead Trent Boult, and Josh Hazlewood suffered leg injuries on the opening two days.
Oppressive weather conditions continued for the fourth straight day as the temperature peaked at 41 degrees Celsius.
New Zealand have only won one test in Australia since their sole series triumph across the Tasman Sea in 1985-86.
The series shifts to the traditional Boxing Day test in Melbourne before concluding with the New Year’s test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

LONDON: Liverpool moved 10 points clear at the top of the Premier League after beating Watford 2-0 on Saturday, while second-placed Leicester City were held 1-1 at home by struggling Norwich City, ending the Foxes’ club record eight-match winning run.
Chelsea’s poor domestic form continued with a shock 1-0 home defeat by lowly Bournemouth, while Sheffield United moved up to fifth with a 2-0 win over fellow promoted side Aston Villa.
West Ham United striker Sebastien Haller earned his side a 1-0 win at Southampton in the late game to ease them away from the relegation zone and leave Southampton in the bottom three.
With third-placed Manchester City 17 points behind Liverpool ahead of their trip to Arsenal on Sunday, Juergen Klopp’s side are in a commanding position heading into a busy holiday period.
Liverpool have 49 points with Leicester on 39, Manchester City 32, Chelsea 29 and Sheffield United 25.
The leaders had Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah to thank for their latest victory. He curled the ball home right-footed in the 38th minute after a characteristic Liverpool counter-attack.
Sadio Mane thought that he had doubled the lead five minutes after the break but the VAR review showed he was marginally offside when nodding the ball in from Xherdan Shaqiri’s cross.
Liverpool had to wait until stoppage time to make sure of the victory thanks to Salah’s superb back-heeled flick.
Watford, with new manager Nigel Pearson in charge for the first time, are rooted to the bottom of the league with just one league win in this campaign and were left to rue wasted chances, particularly a glaring second-half miss from Ismaila Sarr.
It was far from classic Liverpool, but Klopp was pleased with the way his team ground out the win.
“That’s how it is. At 1-0, that’s the result you never can rely on that the game is decided. No problem with that. In December and January especially, you need to show resilience – that’s the most important thing,” said the German.
OWN GOAL
Teemu Pukki gave Norwich a 25th-minute lead at Leicester with a clinical finish before visiting keeper Tim Krul scored an own goal in the 37th, failing to deal with a Jamie Vardy header when the league’s top scorer met a James Maddison corner.
Vardy missed a pair of gilt-edged chances to complete Leicester’s comeback before the home side were twice let off the hook in the closing stages by the Canaries.
Livewire Pukki saw a shot blocked by Ricardo Pereira and the home team’s centre back Caglar Soyuncu cleared a Christoph Zimmermann effort off the line from the resulting corner.
“It just looked like one of those games,” said Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers. “It’s a point and we need to look forwards now. The players have been brilliant.
“When you are on that winning run, you believe you are going to win every game, but of course it does not work like that.”
Sheffield United continue to impress on their return to the top flight and took the lead against Villa with a brilliantly worked opener, Chris Basham back-heeling the ball to John Lundstram who fired it across the box for Fleck to lash home.
The build-up play for Fleck’s second goal was equally impressive as the Blades worked the ball in from the left before striker David McGoldrick hooked a pass over his shoulder to Fleck, who again finished confidently.
Villa were thrown a potential lifeline when the video assistant referee (VAR) called play back to award them a penalty for handball. But Jack Grealish thumped his spot kick off the crossbar and the ball was cleared by Lundstram.
It was the third straight loss for Villa, who stayed out of the relegation zone on goal difference as Southampton suffered defeat later against West Ham.
A 58th-minute header from Chris Wood gave Burnley a 1-0 win over Newcastle United at Turf Moor, ending Sean Dyche’s side’s three-match losing streak.
West Ham had lost five of their last six games but Haller’s left-footed shot crept in just before halftime for his first goal since Oct. 5. Danny Ings struck the woodwork and had a goal disallowed as Southampton rallied after the break.

Rain and bad light did not allow full play on any of the previous four days since Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to bat but Pakistan’s supporters still packed the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on the final day amid bright sunshine.
There was ample entertainment on offer for the crowd as Abid became the only male cricketer to hit a century on his debut in both the test and one-day international formats.
Azam also added to his burgeoning reputation as one of world’s top upcoming batsmen, completing his third test hundred after knocks of 104 and 97 in his last two tests in Australia.
Abid, who scored a ton in his ODI debut against Australia at Dubai in March, remained unbeaten on 109 while Azam was 102 not out as Pakistan reached 252 for two when the stumps were drawn.
Shan Masood and captain Azhar Ali missed out for the hosts, who picked up 20 points for the draw – their first in the World Test Championship, having lost 2-0 in Australia. Sri Lanka also picked up 20 points to take their total to 80.
The recently-launched WTC sees the top nine test nations face-off over a two-year period, scoring points based on their success and culminating in a final at Lord’s in June 2021.

Right-hander De Silva, stuck on 87 since the third day, reached his mark with a sublime cover drive off fast bowler Mohammad Abbas and remained unbeaten on 102.
Dilruwan Perera was not out on 16 when Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne called the pair in to allow his bowlers to have a go at Pakistan’s batsmen.

Daughter of senior advocate Lok Bhakta Rana and Kabita, Garima Rana moved to London with her husband Paras Singh and chose to raise children instead of pursuing a lucrative career. And the dedication and sacrifice paid off when her daughter, Gaurika Singh stole the limelight in the 13th South Asian Games.
She has turned to a Swimmer Mom and is having the best time of her life. “I am very proud of her as she was able to fulfil her long-time dreams of winning gold medal in the SA Games,” said Garima Rana of her daughter. “With the achievement, she is feeling a kind of relieved.
And I am very much happy for her.” Rana said Gaurika’s involvement in swimming was not a planned one. “We were here during summer vacation and had not planned anything. We heard about the championship and we just gave a try. She won medals and rest is history,” said Rana.
Asked about her daughter’s record-equalling performance in the SA Games, Rana said she was impressed with Deepak Bista’s words.
“He had once told me that athletes do not play for records and it happens when they give their best.
Gaurika also did not know about the record and we all were ecstatic when she did that,” said Rana, who thinks the second gold medal was the most special one. “Gaurika had lost to Indian swimmer (Manna Rajiv Patel) in Guwahati three years ago by six-seven seconds and this time around she avenged the defeat and claimed gold by a margin of three seconds. It’s more special as we had not expected that gold,” she added.

Rana denied that she had to sacrifice her career to produce a champion swimmer. “I don’t think I gave up my career for the children.
I felt like spending my time with the kids which is obvious for any parents. The only difference is that I had to do a little bit extra for them as Gaurika needs to manage time properly,” she said. “I keep on trying hard to give that extra minute to Gaurika as she gets very little time in between studies and swimming.
I take her to swimming at 5 AM in the morning and she does not even get enough time for breakfast before going to college.
After college, I take her to training again and then back to home,” said Rana. “Candy Crush is my favourite time pass while waiting for her in vehicle.”
Rana thinks winning medals for the country was an opportunity.
“She goes through a lot of hard times and needs to manage so many things without having her favourite stuffs. If we see the bigger picture, winning medals for the nation is an opportunity in itself,” said Rana. “Everyone has started talking about Olympics but we need to understand that it is way above our standard. Gaurika is a part time swimmer and full time student. Olympics is a different level and we are not even close to that standard yet. We do not rule out possibilities but everyone should understand that we cannot win there tomorrow. What we can do is just keep trying and we will do that,” she added. “We do not want to put any extra pressure on her and we also want her to put in her best efforts every time she plays.”

The 17-year-old not only became Nepal’s first-ever gold medal winner in individual event of swimming but also equalled taekwondo ace Deepak Bista’s record of four gold medals in the history of SA Games. The youngest athlete of Rio Olympic Games in Brazil three years ago, Singh stole limelight winning a total of nine medals — four gold, two silver and three bronze. Nepal finished with the record haul of 206 medals — record 51 gold, 60 silver and 95 bronze — on its way to finishing second for the second time.

Mahesh Acharya of The Himalayan Times spoke to Singh about her dominating performance in the pool. Excerpts:
How did you get into swimming? 
It all started as a hobby. My parents wanted me to learn swimming as a life skill as they did not want me to drown into water. At the age of 11, I took part in a competition in Kathmandu while I was on a holiday. I won medals in my first outing and later it became a passion.
How much time and efforts did you put in for SA Games preparation?
It took me a lot of hard works. I did up to nine sessions after changing my school. I had to bunk my classes to manage time for swimming. I had to take tuition when I was at 11th standard and I had to stay away from my favourite foods. I was also not able to celebrate my birthday, which was a week before the SA Games. We celebrated it on December 10, a day after the swimming competition was over. As I need to focus in my training for much of the time, I do not have many friends and I had to stay back at home all the time.
How was the experience of winning first gold medal?
On paper, my timing was enough to win gold medal.
But it depends on how good you perform on a particular day and the performance of other swimmers also matters. I was scared a little bit as I had an allergy a couple of days ago and I had just recovered from shoulder injury. But everything went well and I was overwhelmed when I finished first.
How is your feeling after creating history?
It’s amazing. Actually I am surprised with the kind of attention I am getting. No one used to come around me in the past as they did not recognise me. But the situation is different this time around and I am overwhelmed as everyone wants to get a picture with me.
What did you feel when you equalled Deepak Bista’s record of four gold medals?
It was big deal to get a single gold medal and I am still amazed with that.
As far as record is concerned, I was not aware of any such achievements.
My parents do not tell me about these at all. They think that I will get nervous and come under pressure which will hamper my performance.
I am extremely happy to equal the record but I want someone to break it. I will be more than happy if a woman athlete breaks it as I think it will help Nepal sports grow further.

Which one is the most special one among four gold medals?
The fourth one is special as I almost lost it. It won it with a margin of 0.02 seconds and the crowd reaction was awesome. Everyone was chanting my name and even I was not sure of getting the gold until I saw it on the score board.
What was the reaction of other countries’ swimmers after you claimed gold one after another? 
They congratulated me for the achievements. They told me that the standard of Nepali swimming had gone up. Some of them were even shocked as many of my competitors knew my timing of previous edition held in India three years ago. They were not aware of my recent timing and progress.
Do you get full support from family? 
I think it’s not possible without the support from family. Actually my mother does everything for me. She cooks for me, drives me to school, takes me to swimming and then back to home. Everyone says my mother keeps on pushing me and I am grateful to her. I have a passion in swimming and I enjoy the way she encourages me.
How is the feeling of justifying about your nationality time and again? 
People say I am not a Nepali citizen as I live outside Nepal and train there. But I have only one passport and that is Nepali. My parents also have Nepali passports. People also tried to stop me from going to Rio Olympic Games in 2016 for the same reason. I represented Nepal in the 12th SA Games in India and won medals for the country. This time also, I won medals for my country.
You have become a role model for many.
Did you get inspired from anyone in this SA Games?
I was enthralled when I met Ayasha Shakya (taekwondo player) at the Prime Minister’s felicitation programme. Women usually stay back at home after giving birth to babies. But she won two gold medals despite having two babies. She is awesome and her story was very inspiring.
How do you manage time between studies and swimming?
It’s very difficult to manage time.
The only thing I do not have much with me is the time between my studies and training. I am thankful to my college for supporting me and allowing me for one-to-one tuition to cover the course. For now, I am enjoying swimming and will continue to do so. I want to go to United States of America after two years.
They have the best training facilities along with strong academics, which is a must after a point of time. I will have to quit swimming after the age of 30 and I need strong academic background to lead my life after career.
What is your next target?
All athletes have a common target: giving the best whether you come first or last. I also try to do the same every time I hit the water. I also got silver and bronze but people only talk about gold medals. They do not understand that we give our best all the time.
What do you want to say to the fans?
I am very much grateful to the crowd here as I received overwhelming support from them. I could win the fourth gold medal just because of the cheers and support from the crowd. But I am surprised to know that the fans have created a song entitled “Go For Gold”. Anyways I am grateful for all the love and support I received in the SA Games and beyond.

Woods clinched a record 27th win in the event with a 3&2 victory over Abraham Ancer to fire up his team and then beamed from the sidelines as they landed crushing early blows before sealing the Cup with a match to spare.

“We did it together. We came here as a team. My team mates and my boys all played well, the captains did an amazing job,” a thrilled Woods said after the Americans sewed up their 11th win in the 13th Cup.
“It’s been one of the more amazing challenges but … all the guys, they believed in one another and relied on one another.”
Matt Kuchar rolled in the winning putt from just over five feet on the 17th as he halved his match with Louis Oosthuizen.
Rickie Fowler halved the final match with Marc Leishman in front of a deflated gallery as the United States won eight of the 12 points on offer in a stinging Sunday reverse for the Internationals, who had led 10-8 overnight.
No team had won after trailing into the final day but the class and depth of the Americans prevailed when it mattered most.
“We were right there to the end … Just a couple of matches didn’t quite go our way,” rued Internationals captain Ernie Els.
“We’re getting closer. We’ve just got to keep it up.”
It has now been 21 years since the Internationals claimed their sole win, that victory coming at Royal Melbourne in 1998.
‘AMAZING GOLF’
Woods‘s win over Ancer brought his record at the biennial event to 27 victories, 15 losses and one halved match in his ninth appearance as a player, eclipsing compatriot Phil Mickelson’s 26-16-13 tally.
At 43 the youngest captain in the event’s 25-year history and only the second playing skipper, Woods finished with an unblemished 3-0-0 record for the week.
Dustin Johnson crushed Chinese debutant Li Haotong 4&3 before Patrick Reed, under pressure after losing all three of his previous matches, pushed his team in front with a 4&2 win over Taiwan’s C.T. Pan.
Reed had his swing coach Kevin Kirk carrying his bag after his brother-in-law caddie was ejected from the event for clashing with a spectator on Saturday.
The Texan charged out of the blocks with six birdies in the opening seven holes before Pan trimmed the American’s six-hole lead to two by the 13th.
“The last couple of days were tough and today wasn’t easy,” said Reed, who was heckled throughout the event for a controversial penalty in the Bahamas last week.
“I played some amazing golf but he put the pressure right back on me.”
The Internationals’ cause suffered a crushing blow when Hideki Matsuyama, having charged to a four-hole lead against Tony Finau, collapsed on the back nine and collected only a half-point.
South Korea’s Im Sung-jae beat Gary Woodland 4&3 and Canadian Adam Hadwin delayed the U.S. procession by grabbing a half-point against Bryson DeChambeau.
But Patrick Cantlay snatched back the lead with a 3&2 win over Chile’s Joaquin Niemann.
Adam Scott, condemned to a ninth defeat in nine Cup appearances, lost 2&1 to Xander Shauffele before Webb Simpson beat South Korean An Byeong-hun by the same margin, slamming the door shut on the Internationals’ hopes of victory.
The only suspense left was whether the Internationals could win the last three matches to grab a share of the Cup for the first time since 2003.
Australian Cameron Smith held up his end of the bargain with a 2&1 win over Justin Thomas but Oosthuizen squandered a two-hole lead to allow Kuchar to extend the Americans’ reign.

Machhindra Football Club defeated Brigade Boys Club 2-0 in the opening match of the Qatar Airways Martyrs Memorial A Division League at the ANFA Complex grounds today.
Yogesh Gurung and Deepak Rai scored a goal each for Machhindra in a match which was shifted to ANFA Complex grounds because of the wet pitch at the Dasharath Stadium.
Gurung opened the scoring in rebound in the 30th minute when he headed home from close after Rai struck against the crossbar in a free kick. Machhindra doubled the tally in the 49th minute after Rai slammed home from the penalty box leaving BBC goalkeeper Bishal Sunar stranded.
Earlier, Machhindra came close to scoring in the 14th minute but Ranjit Dhimal’s ended up with wide shot, while he was unlucky five minutes later as his free kick from just outside the box rebounded after hitting the post.
In a rare move from BBC, skipper Anil Gurung saw his shot blocked by Machhindra defense line in the 28th minute.

BBC created two chances in the second half. Former national team skipper Gurung shot wide off the target before Machhindra goalkeeper Bishal Shrestha made a brilliant punch to deny Jay Gurung in the 88th minute.
Bishal Rai of Machhindra was named the man of the match and he earned Rs 10,000.
Machhindra earned three points for the win but they had a point deducted as per their standing in previous league.
Machhindra had finished 13th in the 14-team league which was held without the relegation provision. ANFA had imposed the provisions of point deduction and monetary penalty for the bottom teams.

PERTH: Australia continue to bat New Zealand out of the opening test match as it extended its lead to 325 runs at tea on the third day under the lights at Perth Stadium.

After New Zealand was skittled out for 166 at lunch in response to Australia’s 416, the home side refused to enforce the follow-on, and batted again to post 75-1 at the break for the loss of opener David Warner (19).
Opener Joe Burns, 32 not out, and in-form Marnus Labuschagne, 18 not out, will resume looking to extend the lead and put the game beyond the tourists. Labuschagne, who top scored with 143 in the first innings — his third consecutive ton — was dropped on 5 when Colin de Gradhomme spilt a difficult running catch off left-arm swing bowler Neil Wagner.
Warner lived a charmed life for over an hour facing 63 ball before miscuing a pull of Tim Southee and was caught at mid on. He survived a review for a catch behind on 15 and on 17 narrowly escaped a run out.
During the innings Warner, playing his 82nd test, became the 12th Australian batsman to amass 7,000 runs in test cricket. He brought up the milestone with a cover driven boundary off Southee.
Despite the 250-run first innings lead, Australia was wary of bowling the second time as temperature topped 40 Celsius (107 F) for the third day in a row. This was in addition to being a bowler short with swing bowler Josh Hazlewood ruled out of the match with a hamstring strain.
Earlier, fast bowler Mitchell Starc took 5-52 — his third five-wicket innings in seven day-night tests and his 13th overall in 55 tests — to hurry New Zealand’s batting demise on a wicket that is beginning to produce variable bounce.
After slicing through the New Zealand top order with four wickets under lights on the second evening, Starc claimed his fifth wicket controversially when de Grandhomme was adjudged caught by on-field umpire Aleem Dar and upheld by review.
De Grandhomme pulled a couple of boundaries off Starc, and two balls later, tried to fend a short pitch delivery that hit the face of the helmet before Steve Smith at second slip caught it. De Grandhomme reviewed Dar’s decision only to be upheld despite a series of inconclusive replays.
Ross Taylor top scored for New Zealand with an unblemished 80 runs and stood between New Zealand and the hosts with a 134-ball innings over 2 ½ hours hitting nine boundaries before offspinner Nathan Lyon (2-48) forced an edge and Smith at slip took his third catch.
The only other notable contribution came from skipper Kane Williamson (34) before he was brilliantly caught by Smith at second slip to end a fighting 76-run third wicket stand. In the second evening.

Umpires called off the day’s play at 1200 local time (0700 GMT) under heavy overcast conditions with plenty of water on the covers and soggy outfield at the Pindi Cricket Stadium.
Both teams stayed in their hotel and only match officials came to the ground on Saturday to witness the gloomy weather conditions.
The ground staff briefly tried to clear the water off covers with wipers and also used super sopper, but thick cloud covers forced the umpires to call off the day’s play as there’s a chance of more rain in this northern city — at least on Saturday.
Sri Lanka, which last played a test in Pakistan in 2009, is 282-6 in its first innings with Dhananjaya de Silva unbeaten on 87 and Dilruwan Perera not out on 6.
So far only 91.5 overs of play has been possible in the first test of the two-match series which is part of ICC’s World Test Championship.
Pakistan is yet to get its first WTC Championship points after two heavy defeats in Australia. Sri Lanka has 60 points after it drew the home series against New Zealand 1-1.
The wet weather has badly affected the first ever test match in Pakistan for over a decade. For cricket-starved fans of Rawalpindi it has been a disappointing four days as the city has last hosted a test match in 2004 when India beat Pakistan by an innings margin.
Sri Lanka was the last team to play a test match in Pakistan, when terrorists attacked the touring team’s bus in Lahore in March 2009. The ambush killed eight people and left several Sri Lankan players and officials injured.
In the interim, Pakistan has played its home test matches on neutral territory, mostly in the United Arab Emirates.

It was like love at first sight for Cory Wallace. The professional Canadian Mountain Bike racer came to Nepal in 2014 to participate in Yak Attack and he instantly fell in love with the divine mountains. And today he loves to spend as much time as he can in Nepal.

Annapurna Circuit is the best outing for the 35-year-old from Canada’s Rocky Mountain and he has cycled the famous trekking circuit three times so far. And for a reason: raise funds for the benefit of Nepali mountain bikers. That’s because the three-time 24 Hour Mountain Bike World Championships winner and the four-time Yak Attack champion, Wallace wants to see Nepali riders excel in Asia and beyond.
Wallace won his third straight 24 Hour Mountain Bike World Championships in Fort William, Scotland in July and he was here for the third attempt of conquering the Annapurna Circuit —normally an 18-day trekking route — in November. Starting the race at midnight of November 26 at Besisahar of Lamjung, the Kona-sponsored rider covered around 220km distance in 20 hours and 33 minutes cycling through Manang, Thorang La Pass, Muktinath before ending at Beni.
This undated image shows Cory Wallace, the professional Canadian Mountain Bike racer. Wallace came to Nepal for the first time to participate in Yak Attack in 2014. Photo: THT
“The most challenging part of the journey is the altitude and cold weather,” says Wallace, the endurance expert. “Starting the race at an altitude of 800m and reaching up to 5416 metres before descending down to 3800m and ending at 800m again is a tough job. And surviving in the freezing weather of minus seven degrees and the wind created by the speed of the cycle is not easy,” he adds. According to Wallace, he had finished the solo race in 23 hours and 57 minutes in his first attempt in 2017 before improving to 21:27 in the second attempt the next year.
Wallace is doing all these for the sake of Nepali riders, to train them and provide them with proper facilities for training. He raised $3,000 in the first year, while the amount rose to $7,000 in the next attempt. This year, he was able to raise $4,000. “With this money, we have started a training centre through Nepal Cyclists Ride to Rescue, a charity run by international team,” he says. “We have opened a centre in Jyatha where the cyclists can undergo indoor training and hit the gym. We also have put recovery tools and opened a café there,” he says.
Doing all these is not easy for Wallace too. He somehow managed to finish the Yak Attack race in his first appearance in 2014 after he struggled to cope up with altitude sickness. But the champion cyclist did everything required to get acclimatise with the local condition and became the first foreigner to win the race in 2016. Since then he has dominated the race and is the four-time defending champion.
“If you want to cycle here, you need to know Nepal first. Altitude and weather can floor you down easily. You should get acclimatised with the local condition first and only then you can race to victory,” says Wallace, who played ice hockey until the age of 20 before switching to cycling. “I also grew up in the mountains in Canada but the Himalayas in Nepal just blew my mind away. People here are so friendly that you are welcomed everywhere and everyone wants to talk to you,” says Wallace, the two-time Canadian Marathon champion. “For me, Nepal is the best country in the world for adventure,” he says.
Wallace believes Nepali cyclists are not getting much attention from the cycling association. “Cycling is a tough job and you must have a certain goal. But the cyclists here do not even get to know the schedule of the national tournament and other events,” says Wallace. “The NCA should work with private races and plan properly for the overall development of the sport. Setting a long-term plan and proper coordination with the stakeholders are the keys. At least, you must have a 12-month schedule,” he says.

Buses from Tokyo’s Shinjuku district conveniently drop climbers off at a station located at the 2,300-metre (7,546 feet) point of the majestic mountain, the country’s tallest at 3,776 metres (12,388 feet). It’s not cheating. This is where most people start the long — and crowded — trek.





The Yoshida trail is the easiest and most popular among the routes to the top, with climbers wearing headlamps and carrying heavy packs spaced just feet apart on the rugged, rocky terrain. It takes an average hiker five to six hours to reach the summit. Most spend the night in simple mountain huts and start the final ascent in darkness. Crammed together in the sparse accommodations is part of the communal climbing experience.
Witnessing the sunrise from the summit of the nation’s symbolic mountain is hard to top. Watching it paint the sky deep orange is magnificent.
Climbing season runs from early July to early September, Mount Fuji will open to the public a couple of weeks before the Tokyo Summer Olympics opening ceremony on July 24.

BANGKOK: Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, edged out Paris and London as the world’s most popular city to visit, according to a survey released on Wednesday, welcome news for Thailand after worries over a drop in foreign arrivals.
Bangkok was named the most-visited city for the fourth consecutive year, with about 22.8 million visitors reported in the annual rankings by MasterCard Inc.
Paris and London were ranked second and third, each with about 19.1 million arrivals, trailed by Dubai with 15.9 million.
Other Southeast Asian cities, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were fourth and fifth in the rankings, based on third-party research, proprietary analysis and public data across 200 destination cities.
New York, Istanbul, Tokyo and Antalya, Turkey, rounded out the top 10.
The number of international visitors across the 200 cities grew by 76% in the last 10 years.
Despite Bangkok’s longtime reign atop the list, the Thai tourism industry has faced headwinds, with arrivals dropping 1.03% year-on-year in May before recovering to grow 0.89% in June from a year earlier.
Tourism accounts for about 12% of Thailand’s economy.
However, weaker Chinese economic growth and a boat accident last year led to a drop off in Chinese arrivals in Thailand in the first half of this year.
The downturn in the number of visitors from China was partially offset by Indian arrivals.
Thailand expects to welcome 2 million Indian tourists in 2019, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, told Reuters, adding this was one year earlier than its target.
In August, the government extended a waiver of a 2,000 baht ($65) fee for visa-on-arrivals for tourists from 18 countries including those from China and India.
A growing middle class and increasing wealth in populations and the rise of low-cost airlines will make travel more accessible, Minor Hotels Chief Executive, Dilip Rajakrier, said in an email.
“Given only less than 10% of the China’s total population having passports today. The potential of the Chinese market will never fade,” he said.

371,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/thailand-extends-visa-fee-waivers-to-boost-tourism-as-growth-slows/,"BANGKOK: Thailand will extend until April next year a measure that waives fees for visas on arrival issued to tourists from 18 countries, as it looks to stimulate growth in tourism to spur a slowing economy, the prime minister said on Tuesday.
The waivers are part of a $10-billion stimulus package to boost growth, including a debt moratorium for farmers, loans for smaller businesses, and more money for low-income earners.
“The cabinet approved the extension of fee waivers until April 2020,” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters, adding that the scheme would cover Lunar New Year and the Thai new year, Songkran.
Foreign tourist receipts make up about 12% of Southeast Asia’s second largest economy, but arrivals increased just 0.89% in June, with visitors from China, the biggest source, declining 7.1% from a year earlier.
The fee of 2,000 baht ($65) is to be waived unil next year for travellers from 18 countries, including China and India.
But the cabinet rejected a proposal for visa-free entry for visitors from China and India, because of security concerns, government spokesman Narumon Pinyosinwat said.

372,https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/not-just-bali-indonesia-hopes-to-develop-more-tourism-sites/,"YOGYAKARTA: Hundreds of tourists, many of them young Westerners, sat on grey stone steps atop the world’s largest Buddhist temple, occasionally checking cellphones or whispering to each other as they waited for daylight.
Sunrise wasn’t spectacular on that recent summer day. But even ordinary dawn at Borobudur Temple — nine stone tiers stacked like a wedding cake and adorned with hundreds of Buddha statues and relief panels — provided a memorable experience.

The 9th-century temple is in the centre of Indonesia’s Java island, a densely populated region with stunning vistas. Other highlights include the towering Hindu temple complex of Prambanan, like Borobudur a UNESCO World Heritage site, and Mount Merapi, the country’s most active volcano, whose lava-covered slopes are accessible by jeep.
While the two temples draw many visitors, other foreigners head to the relaxing beaches of Bali, just east of Java and by far the most popular tourist destination in a nation of thousands of islands and almost 270 million people. More than 6 million tourists visited Bali last year, or about 40 per cent of 15.8 million visitors to Indonesia overall, according to official figures.
Recently reelected President Joko Widodo wants to change this dynamic by pushing ahead with “10 new Balis,” an ambitious plan to boost tourism and diversify Southeast Asia’s largest economy.
Key to the plan is to upgrade provincial airports and improve access to outlying destinations, such as Lake Toba on Sumatra island, more than 1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from Jakarta, the capital. Yogyakarta, the provincial city from where visitors head to Borobudur and Prambanan, is getting a second airport, expected to be fully operational later this year.
Widodo has been promoting his plan in meetings with foreign leaders and in recent interviews, including with The Associated Press, in hopes of encouraging foreign investment. The president of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation told the AP in late July that as part of his push, he would like to see more business ties with the Middle East.
“For investment and tourism, we would like to invite investors from the Middle East as much as possible because … we have many tourism locations in Indonesia, not only one or two or four, but many,” said Widodo. He did not give specifics.
Muslim tourists, including from the Middle East, might also be an easier fit for some of the more conservative areas earmarked for tourism development. Tourism officials have played down the possibility of cultural friction that might accompany the influx of more non-Muslim visitors, arguing that Indonesia’s brand of tolerant Islam can accommodate everyone.
“Maybe there are some particular locations that are very strict (religiously),” said Hiramsyah Thaib, who heads the “10 New Balis” initiative. “We believe we won’t have any problems. Sometimes we have problems in the media, but not in reality.”
Yet Islamic hard-liners have become more assertive in recent years, potentially spooking investors by undermining Indonesia’s image as a moderate nation. Thaib said he believes investor confidence rose “significantly” after Widodo defeated former special forces general Prabowo Subianto in April’s presidential election. Subianto had been backed by Muslim groups favouring Shariah law.
The tourism plan remains key to Widodo’s final five-year term, though at least one target — 20 million visitors this year — appears to have been too ambitious. The 2019 visitor tally is expected to be 18 million, based on current growth figures, said Thaib.
Still, the Indonesian tourism sector grew by 7.8 per cent in 2018, or twice the global average, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
One of the 10 sites earmarked for development is the Borobudur Temple area and nearby Yogyakarta, a city of several hundred thousand people that are embedded in a large metro area. The city is a centre of Javanese culture and a seat of royal dynasties going back centuries.
In 2017, former President Barack Obama and his family visited the city, where his late mother, Ann Dunham, spent years doing anthropological research. Obama, who lived in Indonesia as a child, toured Borobudur and Prambanan during the nostalgic trip.
But while the Obamas got around with relative ease, including private jet travel, ordinary visitors struggle with congested streets packed with motorbikes weaving in and out of slow-moving traffic.
Travellers hoping to be in place at Borobudur just before sunrise need at least 90 minutes to get there from Yogyakarta, a journey of 40 kilometres (24 miles). A 230-kilometre (140-mile) round trip to the Dieng highlands, with terraced fields, small temples and a colourful volcanic lake, requires a full day of travel, some of it on bumpy back roads.
Anton McLaughlin, a 55-year-old visitor from York, England, said he was astounded by the number of motorbikes in the streets. Speaking during a jeep tour of the slopes of Mount Merapi, he said he’s become more aware of the natural disasters Indonesians endure regularly. Indonesia straddles the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Merapi’s last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people, and the ruins of one destroyed hamlet were part of the tour.
“People just seem to crack on with life,” McLaughlin said.
Just a day after his tour, the volcano shot out hot clouds and lava that flowed 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) down its slopes. No casualties or damage were reported.
Jan Tenbrinke, 37, from Zwolle in the Netherlands, said Bali is the next stop for his family of four, but that he hoped to get a better sense of Indonesian culture in Yogyakarta.
In the city, tourists can visit workshops for Batik textiles, silver jewellery and Kopi Luwak — coffee made from partially digested coffee cherries that were eaten and defecated by wild tree cats, or civets. Billed as the “world’s most expensive coffee,” Kopi Luwak became known to a wider audience in the 2007 Jack Nicholson-Morgan Freeman movie “The Bucket List.”
Local museums, including two royal palaces and a former Dutch fort, pose a challenge for foreign visitors eager to learn more about local history and culture because they mostly lack easily accessible explanations in English.
Thaib, the tourism official, acknowledged that there is room for improvement. He said Indonesia is determined to catch up to other Asian nations, including Thailand, which he said began developing their tourism industries much sooner.
“There is still a lot of work,” he said of his nation’s efforts. “We believe we are on the right track.”

HIKKADUWA: Sipping fresh coconut water while sunbathing on deserted Hikkaduwa beach, Alexi Konchayenko, a sports trainer from Ukraine, struck a stoical note.
Bomb blasts can happen “anywhere, anytime,” he said, adding that he was not afraid. “Sri Lanka is an amazing country. This is my first visit and I will tell my friends also to come.”
His is a lone voice — and a lone presence. Sri Lanka was the Lonely Planet guide’s top travel destination for 2019, but since the Easter Sunday attacks on churches and luxury hotels, foreign tourists have fled.
Many of those booked to come in the next few months have cancelled. Hotel occupancy across the island has plummeted by 85% to 90%. The tropical beaches, restaurants and shops are empty.
The coordinated suicide bombings on April 21 not only destroyed lives but also wiped out the livelihoods of Sri Lankans who depend on tourism.
More than 250 people, including 45 foreigners mainly from China, India, the US and the UK, died in the Islamic State group-claimed blasts.
Tourists normally come to Hikkaduwa, in the southwest, for the strong waves that are perfect for surfing and sparkling clear waters made for snorkelling. Today, of the 27 hotels, very few are open. Most, along with the eateries that line the 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of palm-fringed beach, are closed.
Among the few hotels still open is Hikkaduwa Beach Hotel. On April 21, all 50 rooms were occupied; today, only a handful. “It’s a real disaster. We don’t know what to do right now,” said Sanjeewani Yogarajah, an executive with the hotel. She said the attack has cost the hotel 5.5 million Sri Lankan rupees ($31,000), forcing the hotel’s management to send half the staff home.
Some tourism officials say the damage to the industry after the bombings is worse than during the 26-year civil war between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the government which ended a decade ago. At least then, the violence was mostly contained to the north of Sri Lanka, they said. This time, no part of the island has remained untouched by the blasts.
Lankesha Ponnamperuma, general manager of hotel chain Hikka Tranz, is one of the luckier ones. While most hotels report wholesale cancellations, he is surviving thanks to business from local residents. Last Friday, two-thirds of the 150 rooms were booked, mostly by domestic tourists.
“I haven’t sacked anyone yet. Instead, we are training our people to adjust their expenditure and helping them restructure their bank loans,” Ponnamperuma said.
The president of Sri Lanka’s Hotels Association, Sanath Ukwatta, said hotels have offered 30-50% discounts to entice local residents.
Such a strategy won’t solve the problem, he said, but will “help at least to keep the hotels going.”
The manager of a clothing shop said the owner had shut the group’s other two shops and the factory too. “Business collapsed after April 21,” said Kumari, who declined to give her surname.
According to government figures, there has been an 80% drop in arrivals since the attack. Tourism accounts for 4.9% of Sri Lanka’s GDP. Last year, 2.3 million tourists visited the island, generating $4.4 billion in revenues, a nearly 12% jump from 2017. Around half a million Sri Lankans directly depend on tourism while 2 million depend on it indirectly.
One of them is Mohomed Musflick, the owner of a souvenir shop in Galle which is full of wood carvings, local paintings and postcards. “I have not sold one item. There are no tourists and we are in a huge crisis,” he said.
While life is gradually returning to normal on the island with offices and schools re-opening, the tourism industry is in a sombre mood over the slump in foreign tourists. Tour operators from Russia, Norway and Britain have cancelled bookings going right up to April 2020.
A travel ban issued by nearly a dozen countries is the greatest cause for concern. “The ban is our main worry. Until it is removed or softened, we can’t start our marketing to attract tourists. If it is lifted soon, we are hopeful we can bounce back this year or otherwise definitely next year for sure,” said Yogarajah.
In the meantime, Sri Lanka’s government should target “people and countries resilient to this kind of attacks and situations, such as Russia, Israel and India,” said Anusha Frydman, managing director of the Lavanga Resort and Spa.
The industry is clear about what else it wants from the authorities: Ensure that stringent security measures are in place to reassure potential visitors; persuade politicians to put their differences aside and adopt a bipartisan approach on national security; and work fast to get the travel ban lifted.
To help the industry cope, the government has put together a relief package comprising easy loans at special rates and reduced taxes. The government also plans to formulate a $100 million insurance fund for compensation to any tourist injured or killed while visiting the island.
“In the past we have had many serious crises and we have recovered. I am quite positive we can do it again,” said Jan van Twest, general manager of the Fortress Resort and Spa near Galle, where 750 room nights have been cancelled from May to October.
“But we need to recover, recover very fast,” he said.

Whenever I told someone I was planning to climb to Mount Everest Base Camp this spring, I received the same shocked and wide-eyed response: “Be careful!” While that’s good advice for any adventure, it was difficult to convince friends and family that this trip would not at all be the same thing as actually climbing Mount Everest.
Instead, the Everest Base Camp Trek provides an opportunity for regular hikers like me to tackle a feasible portion of one of the most iconic climbs in the world.
Base Camp is located at 17,600 feet, well below the peak of Everest, which is 29,000 feet. Base Camp is where those planning to summit spend weeks acclimatising and preparing for their journey. It is also the furthest you can go using only your legs before other equipment like ropes and ice picks get involved.
Our eight-day journey to Base Camp began at 9,300 feet, in the small Nepalese mountain town of Lukla. There are no roads to Lukla. It is accessible only by a 30-minute plane ride from Kathmandu. When we landed, I was shocked to find the area crowded and bustling, filled with locals selling trinkets and outdoor gear, and what felt like hundreds of trekkers preparing for their climbs.
From Lukla, we wound our way up muddy paths and across dangling suspension bridges, stepping aside for herds of yak and dzo (yak/cattle hybrids) as we walked further and further into the most remote area in which I have ever hiked.
Yet, it didn’t feel that way. Small towns continued to greet us all the way up. There were lodges to stay in. There were restaurants and bars. I have photos at the world’s highest Irish pub and the world’s highest bakery. In one of the larger towns, Namche Bazaar, at about 11,200 feet, there was even a North Face store. In these towns, dozens of miles from the nearest road, all food and supplies are brought in by helicopter, porter or animal.
In addition to breathtaking, 360-degree views of the Himalayas, elaborate Buddhist monuments lie along the entire route. Every day along the trail we saw massive, intricately painted boulders and colourful stupas (structures meant to bring good karma) wrapped in multicoloured prayer flags. At one point, we even toured a large, fully functioning monastery.
The terrain itself is not as difficult as you’d expect. Anyone in good physical shape could do it, and I have done many other hikes that I found more challenging. We still climbed several thousand feet per day, but the inclines were relatively gradual. This trek, instead, should be known for its panoramic views and the unique experience of hiking through these remote mountain towns.
Of course, the trip is not without risks, but they lie in unexpected places. The flights to and from Lukla are the most dangerous part of the journey. The Lukla airport has long been considered one of the most dangerous airports in the world — and in fact, a fatal crash occurred while we were there. I tried to push the knowledge of the airport’s dangers to the furthest recesses of my mind as I boarded a tiny propeller plane bound for that very place.
The plane ride is beautiful, with mountains on all sides, but the landing is enough to put even the fiercest adventurer on edge. A standard runway is between 6,000-8,000 feet long; Lukla’s is only 1,700 feet long. It’s sloped upward to help slow the plane before it hits the solid rock wall waiting at the end of it. At the other end is a 2,000-foot drop. After landing safely, we were mesmerised watching the planes taking off for Kathmandu literally fly off the edge of a cliff.
Altitude sickness is also a concern, though if you work with an experienced guiding company as we did, they will ensure you climb up slowly to acclimatise. We had two layover days and hiked a far shorter distance each day than our bodies were capable of going. This itinerary helped us grow accustomed to the air as it grew thinner.
Hiking up slowly didn’t feel like a burden, though, as it allowed extra time to take in those jaw-dropping views. The higher I climbed, the more I felt like I could reach out and touch the shimmering, snow-capped peaks. The further we progressed, the more the mountains seemed to bend toward us like we were inside of a snow globe.
At several points, we caught sight of Everest’s majestic peak peering out from behind its neighbours. Most of Everest lies in Tibet, but the peak is in Nepal. As such, the trek to Base Camp does not actually take place on Mount Everest, but inside Sagarmatha National Park — Sagarmatha being the Nepalese name for Everest.
Each day, as we made it a little higher, the air became a little thinner and our breath a little shorter. By day eight, the time between each step I took had grown significantly. I was breathing hard. My feet were dragging and my head pounding. I trudged slowly upward, but upward nonetheless, knowing the goal was within reach.
By mid-afternoon, we hiked across the final ridge and Base Camp came into view. We had made it to the gateway to the top of the world.
Base Camp rests on a massive glacier. I high-fived my group and took in the sight of dozens of yellow tents pitched across the ice, tents belonging to those preparing for their ascent. According to my trekking guide, the glacial terrain changes so rapidly that the expeditioners have to move their tents every two weeks.
We took pictures beside the sign declaring we were there and feasted on dark chocolate almond bark to celebrate. As the afternoon clouds rolled in, we lay back and watched the mountains disappear above our heads. The cheers and squeals of more trekkers arriving filled the air as it began to snow.
It may not have been the top, but it was nonetheless a spot where most people on the planet will never set foot. I feel so lucky to have stood in that very special place, and, as I always do at the end of a hike, I feel so strong knowing it was my own two feet that got me there.

Photo: AP
AMSTERDAM: The city of Amsterdam’s latest attempt to rein in the nuisance of over-tourism by banning guided tours of the red light district has run into opposition from some of the people it is intended to protect: sex workers.
The Dutch capital plans to ban such tours, saying they are disrespectful and contribute to congestion in the narrow, canal-side streets where scantily-clad sex workers sit behind windows to attract customers.
The first step in the new policy was taken Monday night in the red light district, with tours banned from 7 p.m.
On a recent Friday night, the problem was clear to see: Tourists bathed in a red glow emanating from the windows and peep shows’ neon lights were packed shoulder to shoulder as they shuffled through the alleys.
But sex workers’ union Proud questions whether banning tours will reduce tourist numbers and argues that guides educate visitors and encourage them to behave more respectfully toward the women.
“It could also be that now there are no guides that people just wander into the area themselves and gawk at the women behind the window and take photos because there is no one anymore to inform them how to behave or what the rules of the game are in this area,” said a sex worker who goes by the name of Velvet and is the advocacy coordinator for Proud. Velvet declined to give her real name, saying that because of the stigma attached to sex work, most sex workers use a working name or pseudonym to protect their privacy and safety.
Amsterdam’s Prostitution Information Center, which is housed in the same building as Proud, offers its own red light district tours.
The total ban on guided tours, which is planned to come into full force on Jan. 1, is another step in the city’s campaign to reduce the problems associated with over-tourism and part of a broader package of measures reining in tours in the city.
Bobien van Aalst of the Dutch tour guide association Guidor slammed the ban on tours, not just to the red light district but to other historic parts of the city. She said it means guides won’t be able to explain to tourists where Rembrandt van Rijn painted one of his first famous works or where the painter’s wife is buried.
“I mean it’s like in Paris if you’re forbidding (tours) to go to the Arc de Triomphe or the Eiffel Tower,” she said.
City Hall says that more than 1,000 tour groups per week now operate around the Old Church Square in the heart of the red light district.
“Yeah, there’s really over-tourism there — too crowded. I mean there were evenings where … residents basically couldn’t leave their homes anymore because the alleys were blocked,” the city’s deputy mayor, Udo Kock, told The Associated Press.
People who work in Amsterdam’s sex industry question whether there are more tourists, or whether similar numbers are squeezing into a red light district that has shrunk in recent years as hundreds of the sex workers’ windows have been shuttered in an attempt to diversify the narrow streets.
Kock acknowledges that not everybody is happy, but says many others are pleased that the city is tackling the tours.
The red light district is a tourist magnet, especially after dark, with crowds of people waiting to get into sex shows and visiting the Red Light Secrets Museum of Prostitution, where you can experience the windows from a sex worker’s perspective by sitting on a stool in front of a “window” onto which images are projected of men walking past and peering in.
The museum’s manager, Natascha Flipsen, agrees that guided tours help educate the visitors not just about the history of the centuries-old red light district, but also about how to treat the women who work there with respect.
And she says that tourism is good for the business.
For tourists, “this is like the once in a lifetime experience, so they visit the sex work as well of course,” Flipsen said.

A lighting strike is pictured from an aircraft at an area in Singapore. Photo: Skanda Gautam/THT
So, my brother, who lives in the US, was getting married. Arrange a visa, head to the States to attend the wedding — that’s a lot of work. I thought I’d just wish him from here. A few days later, a Viber group was created including me and other children from my maternal family, and all of my mother’s sisters — eight in total. Now the wedding would take place in Bali, Indonesia. Wow a ‘Destination Wedding’!
More excited than ever, I agreed that I was going. So I started saving, and yes the time finally came.
I took leave from office for 10 days, booked the tickets for my mother and me, and started packing. When I left my house and reached the airport, it didn’t feel like I was actually going to Bali, but when I sat on the plane, I realised that my journey had begun. The flight, which was pretty chilled with a couple of beers, was of around four hours to Singapore, our transit point.
Then through tough Singapore security, helped by Starbucks coffee and a coconut drink, we were finally on our way to Bali.
So Bali. What can I say? The first thing that crossed my mind is ‘hot and sweaty’. As we got the hang of the weather, we found our guide, and an hour’s drive to the villa.





The sight along the way was awesome — statues of Hindu deities were around every street and corner. And you could see beautiful hand-carved statues of Ganesha and other deities in the shops, a breathtaking scene, their faith in religion, how they worship the gods.
I later found out that they are so religious that all of Bali was closed for two days for New Year’s prayers a day before we arrived. They meditate and pray at temples and their homes.
The villa was like a dream house with a swimming pool. The first thing I did was leave my baggage and go to a local pub for some chilled beers. The most popular and loved beer was Bintang, which cost 25,000 rupiah a bottle — shocking at first, but I later realised it’s around Rs 200.
People from all over the world, especially Australians come here to surf.
The weather is humid, so you sweat like crazy. It is constant summer with no winter, and even the metrology can’t predict rainfall. So it’s mandatory to spend your day in the pool with yes, chilled beer.
The local food was amazing, and hospitality commendable. The beautiful sunset by the ocean added to our first few days making everything surreal.
We also went for Luwak coffee tasting where they give you different drinks of flavoured tea and coffee, which was all free until you wished to drink the world’s most expensive coffee — Luwak animal poop coffee. The process to extract the poop was amazing using traditional hand method of collection to packing. A small cup cost us around 350,000 million Indonesian rupiah, and to buy a small pack I spent nearly 750,000 million rupiah, a gift for my dad that equals around $80. Crazy right? And it was really strong too.
The monkey temple was cool, more like a jungle with amazing sculptures of deities and filled with monkeys, better looking than the ones from Nepal. More mature looking I must say.
Then we visited the Saroswati Temple famous for its lotus blooms. Most people come for wedding photo shoots.
I also pampered myself to a fish spa for my feet. So ticklish!
Then the big day arrived — everything had to be Nepali style, the groom in a car to the wedding temple to the attire to the wedding dance janti. People were amazed, a few even made attempts to film the wedding.
About 50 guests attended the wedding.
The temple where the wedding was held was a massive one dedicated to Lord Shiva. The rituals were in Sanskrit language and I couldn’t understand any of it! The ritual was short as compared to Nepal, the ceremony concluded in just around two hours.
My brother had hired an amazing wedding planner. The ceremony was for two days — mehendi night at our new villa by the beach with black sand, a Jacuzzi and a swimming pool and breathtaking view of the surfers. The whole night was a blast with no sleep where my phone dived into the pool and died. Sad story but …
The next day was the wedding — early morning ceremony by the ocean and janti in 1940s classic vehicle headed towards the temple where the ceremony took place. The reception took place in the evening where a Balinese fire dancer showcased all kinds of acts and fire tricks. The decoration was beautiful with all the lights reflected by the pool of our villa.
We had heard of the popular Bali swing, so the last day we spent seeing that and other sites and shopping places.
Though we had a few mishaps  — a few had their luggage arriving a day late, one bashed his head swimming at 3:00 am, one broke his leg, my aunt lost $1,200, and I dropped my phone in the pool, it was one heck of a week.
As I write this story, I still feel the wind, the ocean, my family’s laughter and the closeness we felt coming together from different parts of the world for a week, leaving our hectic lives behind to enjoy and be together in a beautiful new place and for such an auspicious occasion. It was an experience of a life time.

CYRENE, LIBYA: Graffiti covers the walls of a Greek amphitheatre in Cyrene, an ancient ruined city in eastern Libya now struggling with neglect, vandals and illegal confiscation of land by locals.
The deserted souvenir shops and cafes on the mountainous road leading to the 2,600-year-old site are the only reminders that this used to be a major tourist destination.
Looting has hit Libya’s archaeological sites since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 when the country descended into turmoil with rival administrations competing for control.
Cyrene is one of five of UNESCO’s World Heritage sites in the North African country listed for their outstanding value. Others include the ruins of the Roman city of Leptis Magna, and Sabratha, both in western Libya.
Apart from Cyrene, some 200 km (124 miles) east of Benghazi, the east of the country has the Apollonia site just 20 km away.
With tourists gone and the antiquities department complaining about budget shortages, vandals have smeared graffiti on columns and looted artefacts.
Some treasures such as heads or entire torsos of statues listed in guidebooks issued in 2011 are no longer there.
“Many artefacts have been smuggled abroad,” said Ahmad Hussein, the head of the antiquities department of a parallel administration in charge of eastern Libya.
Unable to prevent theft, his department has been registering artefacts, a process which has helped to recover some in Europe, he said.
There was better site protection before 2011, but excavation at the site, in fact, dates back to Italian rule — the colonialists’ equipment can still be seen. The last Italians left the east in 1943 following their military defeat when the region came under British administration.
“There has been a lot of destruction in recent years,” said Ismail Miftah, a farmer living next to Cyrene. “Ordinary people don’t appreciate the ancient heritage.”

KATHMANDU: Four Sherpa climbers who got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Mt Makaulu Base Camp in two-metre deep snow in Sankhuwasabha for over a week shared that the high route of the Great Himalaya Trail witnessed an unusual snowfall in this winter season.
Four climbers – Pemba Jangbu Sherps, Darinji Sherpa, Pemba Rinji Sherpa and Pasang Gelu Sherpa were rescued by a Kailash Air helicopter on Monday as they ran out of food in the mountain area while embarking on a trek namely “German Nepal Friendship: The Great Himalaya Trail in Winter”.
It was really an unusual snowfall in the region, one of the team leaders Pemba Jangbu shared.
“We had to to turn around due to heavy snow in the Barun-Valley in Sankhuwasabha this season,” he said, recounting that as this is was a friendship project between Nepal and Germany the crew continued to Barun Dobhan trying to reach the high passes – Sherpani Col 6,110m, West Col 6,100m and Amphu Labtsa 5,700m – to cross into Khumbu.
“This is not only the story of the first ever attempt of the GHT High Route in winter but a story about German-Nepali friendship,” German Geographer Hannes Kuenkel, who is also a leader of the team, added.
This year the crew regrouped and was joined by seven experienced Sherpa – Darinji, Pemba Rinji, Pasang Gelu, Dafuri, Pasang Dawa, Phurba Sonam, Pasang Tendi – from Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Municipality-1, Solokhumbu, German photographer Martin Poetter and Austrian videographer Julia Brunner.
As they started their trek from Olongchun Gola where they had to break up last time and then crossed the snowy Lumbha Samba Pass (5,175m), the team reached Arun Valley on January 11.
“As all routes up to Makulu Base Camp were very difficult we tried the High Route above Hongon up to Malun Pokhari at 4,000m and we had experienced heavy snowfall and up to two feet high snow which made it impossible to hike with heavy loads,”  Kuenkel said.
As the weather was very unpredictable and the route not marked or built the team decided to take their only chance for the High Route by splitting the group in Gadhi on January 19 and sending the four strongest Sherpas led by Pemba Jangbu with only minimum equipment and light packs via Keke La pass (4,100m) towards the high passes while the others returned to Tumlingtar and flew via Kathmandu to Namche to meet up with the crew again, according to him.
The plan was that the Germans met the Sherpa again in Khumbu and together finished the Eastern part of the GHT via the icy Trashi Labtsa Pass (5,777m).
“Unfortunately the weather became worse and the Sherpa team got stuck between Yangri Kharka and Makaulu Base Camp in up to two-metre deep snow and the crew experienced 120 hours of continuous snowfall between January 22 (1pm) and January 28 (1am).”
On January 24, the snowfall stopped for 13 hours but the helicopter could not start from Kathmandu due to bad weather there. Pemba Jangbu who led over 26 expeditions told that he never experienced this kind of snowfall before. “On 28th January, a helicopter rescue was successful. It was just in time as the crew run out of gas and food.”
This winter the extraordinarily heavy snowfall did not allow the team to continue. So the team returned to Kathmandu were they stay together as friends and already prepare plans for a next attempt, according to Kuenkel, who visited Nepal for 15 times.
The two expedition leaders Pemba Jangbu and Kuenkel mentioned that they continued this project for three reasons: to promote trekking in Nepal, make people sensitive for the consequences of global warming and demonstrating how strong and powerful the international friendship can be.
According to team members, Pemba Jangbu, also owner of IAM Trekking & Expeditions and the German Geographer Hannes met during an Everest North Side Expedition which was shattered by the big earthquake in 2015.
In January 2017 they started the first attempt of the GHT High Route in winter. As the eastern part of Nepal has the highest mountains and passes they decided to take that challenge first and go from East to West starting in Taplejung.
They went up to Pangpema BC of Kantschendzonga, crossing the Nango La (4700m) to Olangchung Gola. That year the German became heavily sick in Olangchung Gola and had to give up early.

BANGKOK: Thailand approved marijuana for medical use and research on Tuesday, the first legalisation of the drug in a region with some of the world’s strictest drug laws.
The junta-appointed parliament in Thailand, a country which until the 1930s had a tradition of using marijuana to relieve pain and fatigue, voted to amend the Narcotic Act of 1979 in an extra parliamentary session handling a rush of bills before the New Year’s holidays.
“This is a New Year’s gift from the National Legislative Assembly to the government and the Thai people,” said Somchai Sawangkarn, chairman of the drafting committee, in a televised parliamentary session.
While countries from Colombia to Canada have legalised marijuana for medical or even recreational use, the drug remains illegal and taboo across much of Southeast Asia, which has some of the world’s harshest punishments for drug law violations.
Marijuana traffickers can be subject to the death penalty in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.
But in Thailand, the main controversy with legalisation involved patent requests by foreign firms that could allow them to dominate the market, making it harder for Thai patients to access medicines and for Thai researchers to access marijuana extracts.
“We’re going to demand that the government revoke all these requests before the law takes effect,” said Panthep Puapongpan, Dean of the Rangsit Institute of Integrative Medicine and Anti-Aging.
Some Thai advocates hope that Tuesday’s approval will pave the way for legalisation for recreational use.
“This is the first baby step forward,” said Chokwan Chopaka, an activist with Highland Network, a cannabis legalisation advocacy group in Thailand.

BERLIN: More than 6 million visitors, 7.5 million liters of beer, 124 rotisserie oxen and Bill Clinton in lederhosen; another Oktoberfest in Munich has come and gone.
Festival organizers say good fall weather helped attract 100,000 more people to the annual event than last year; in all, 6.3 million from about 70 countries. That’s despite this year’s Oktoberfest running only 16 days — two fewer than in 2017.
Former US President Clinton and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showed up Friday night — he dressed in traditional Bavarian garb and she in a trademark pantsuit.
Security guards confiscated 101,000 liter-size beer mugs from sticky-fingered guests seeking souvenirs. Munich authorities cleaned up 95 tons of garbage during the festival that ended Sunday.

MEDORA: For travelers looking to visit all 50 states, North Dakota is often one of the last to be checked off. It’s not exactly on the way to anywhere else, and flying there is expensive.
It ended up being 49th on my 50-state quest (sorry, Idaho!). Part of the challenge was deciding what to do there and how to get there. I had to choose between visiting Fargo in eastern North Dakota (and the name of one of my favorite movies) or Theodore Roosevelt National Park in the west.
It’s 330 miles (530 kilometers) between them, and I didn’t have time for both on a week-long road trip that also included Montana’s Glacier National Park and Idaho’s Craters of the Moon.
In the end, Roosevelt Park won out. Photos of its badlands and prairies enchanted me, and the story of Teddy Roosevelt’s sojourn there following the deaths of his wife and mother on the same day intrigued me.
What was it about this place that allowed this future president to grieve and recover — while at the same time inspiring him to become one of America’s most influential conservationists? I needed to see it for myself.
GETTING THERE
My husband and I flew to Denver — by air from New York, the cheapest jumping-off point — and rented a car (unlimited mileage, of course). We then drove 600 miles (965 kilometers) north through Wyoming and South Dakota to the tiny North Dakota town of Medora (population 132), at the entrance to the park’s South Unit.
Fortunately, those 600 miles were easily done in a day, thanks to speed limits of 75 and 80 mph (120-128 kph) in many spots, and little traffic outside Colorado. Still, it felt like we were heading to a pretty remote place, and I wondered if the park would hold its own against national parks I’d visited in Alaska, Hawaii and the Southwest, not to mention Yellowstone and Yosemite.
About 700,000 people visit Roosevelt Park yearly, compared to the more than 3 million annual visitors at places like Montana’s Glacier Park.
THE LOOP AND WILDLIFE
Teddy Roosevelt Park is open 24 hours daily. We arrived at 7:30 a.m. one day at the tail end of last summer. Map in hand, we drove the 36-mile (58-kilometer) scenic loop around the park’s South Unit, stopping at many of the nearly 20 points of interest along the way.
Within minutes, we came upon a prairie dog town. Dozens of the tiny creatures scampered back and forth, popping in and out of little holes amid scrubby grasses. We’d see three more prairie dog towns before we completed the loop, along with wild horses grazing on a hill by the roadside and in another spot, a herd of bison.
The wildlife encounters were thrilling and unexpected surprises.
THE LANDSCAPE
The landscape was thrilling too. The scent of sage perfumed the air, and bursts of red foliage punctuated the gray-green grasslands. Stripes of peach, cream and mud-brown earth and stone lined the curving banks of the Little Missouri River.
Framing it all were the famous badlands stretching to the horizon: flat-topped stone formations with striated slopes in tawny yellows and russet reds, dotted with bright green trees and patches of grass. They looked like the crusty paws of some massive alien creature on the verge of rising up.
We did most of the hikes along the loop drive, some just a few minutes’ walk to an overlook, others 20 to 40 minutes along hilly trails covering a mile or more. At every stop, we were awed by the scenery, from the astonishing palette of earthy hues to the stone shapes etching land and sky.
ROOSEVELT’S STORY
An exhibit at the visitor center tells Roosevelt’s story. On his first visit in 1883, he hunted bison and invested in a ranch near Medora. He’d been a state assemblyman in his native New York, but after his mother and wife both died on Feb. 14, 1884, he left politics and returned to the badlands to mourn his losses.
He lived in a small ponderosa pine cabin now located just steps from the visitor center. It’s furnished with period pieces and some of his belongings, including his traveling trunk, a replica of his writing desk and a rocking chair.
Roosevelt lived the cowboy life, spending days riding and herding in what was considered America’s last frontier. His experiences there were formative: He lost more than $24,000 when blizzards decimated the cattle he’d invested in. He witnessed the environmental damage done by overgrazing. And he realized that the bison, who once roamed the plains in the millions, had dwindled to the hundreds.
Roosevelt wrote three books inspired by his Western sojourn. He eventually returned to politics, serving as New York governor and from 1901-1909, as US president. His accomplishments included the conservation of 230 million acres of land, a legacy that led to the creation of the National Park Service in 1916.
For me, Roosevelt Park ranks among the most interesting and beautiful I’ve seen. I wish I hadn’t waited so long to visit, and I hope someday to go back and absorb more of the place that Roosevelt called “a land of vast silent spaces — a place of grim beauty.”

DENPASAR, INDONESIA: The Indonesian tourist island of Bali closed its international airport Friday, stranding thousands of travelers, as the Mount Agung volcano gushed a 2,500-meter (8,200-feet) column of ash and smoke.
The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said nearly 450 flights were canceled, affecting some 75,000 people.
The regional Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Darwin, Australia, said winds would carry the ash southwest toward Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island. Volcanic ash is a potentially deadly threat to aircraft that can cause engines to “flame out.”
The volcano began belching ash and smoke on Thursday and several airlines canceled inbound and outbound flights scheduled for the evening.
“We hadn’t a place to stay for the night so we had to find something else, just took a taxi and stayed at a random hostel,” said a stranded German backpacker who identified herself as Louisa. “We hoped that we could leave this morning, but the airport is closed,” she said.
Two small airports, at Banyuwangi and Jember in eastern Java, also closed because of the ash threat.
Agung’s alert level has not been raised and an exclusion zone around the crater remains at 4 kilometers (2.5 miles).
The disaster agency said the closure of Bali’s airport is in effect until 7 p.m. It said the situation will be reviewed at midday.
Australia’s national airline Qantas said in a statement that it’s “currently not safe” to operate Bali flights.
It said it was monitoring advice from the ash advisory center and its own pilots and meteorologists would decide when flights can resume.
The volcano, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) northeast of Bali’s tourist hotspot of Kuta, last had a major eruption in 1963, killing about 1,100 people.
It had a dramatic increase in activity last year, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, but had quietened by early this year. Authorities lowered its alert status from the highest level in February.
Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Government seismologists monitor more than 120 active volcanoes.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: Once a pristine Thai paradise, the secluded bay made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie “The Beach” has been exhausted by mass tourism. Now it’s getting a break.
After Friday, the daily influx of dozens of boats and thousands of visitors unsuccessfully scrambling for an unspoiled view of Maya Bay’s emerald waters and glistening white sand will end. The attraction is being closed for four months to give its coral reefs and sea life a chance to recover.
Thailand has promoted unfettered tourism for decades and the onslaught on Maya Bay, which is on Phi Phi Leh Island in the Andaman Sea, has only picked up pace in recent years. Authorities now say they are striving to balance profit and conservation and the closure will happen every year.
It is part of a rethink happening globally about unrestricted tourism that brings in big dollars but damages historic sites, harms the environment and often alienates locals.
Last month, the Philippines began a six-month closure of popular Boracay Island, whose waters President Rodrigo Duterte described as a “cesspool.” Venice, the famed Italian lagoon city that lives off tourism, installed gates at two access bridges during a four-day holiday in April so it could turn back visitors if numbers became overwhelming.
Many of Thailand’s marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October during the monsoon season but because of Maya Bay’s popularity, it hasn’t had a break since a Hollywood crew set foot on its sands in 1999 to film the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland. Its corals have been decimated by the suffocating clouds of sand and sediment churned up by speedboats.
“I tried to push this campaign for many, many years, but you know in Thailand we are a tourism industry country and we need a lot of money, so before not so many people listened,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine biologist and member of a government committee on development and the environment.
“It should have been done 10 years ago but at least it has been done,” he said.
Thailand had about 35 million international visitors last year, a five-fold increase in little more than two decades.
Shi Pengfei, among the last tourists to visit Maya Bay before its closure, said he had no idea that there would be so many people on the beach.
“I feel that there are so many people here,” said Shi, from Henan, China. “The government’s plan to close off the beach for a few months is only natural because the ocean needs a break, a chance to recover, so that the next generation can have a better and even more beautiful destination.”
But locals aren’t entirely happy. The head of the Phi Phi Tourist Business Association, Watrapol Jantharo, said he was surprised when the closure was announced in March by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
He said locals were under the impression that Maya Bay would only be closed to boats, while visitors would still walk to the bay from the other side of the island.
“We are not against protecting our environment,” he said. “We know full well that Maya Bay is our important resource, like a rice field to a farmer, but we wish there are more communications about the government’s plan before the decision was made.”
Thon, however, said the plan was discussed with locals for three years before a decision was made.
“In the past, we made some mistake because we think that the money is very important. But now we are trying to change our idea,” he said. Overseas visitors are “very important to our country, but the most important thing is our national resource. We have to preserve and hand it to the next generation.”
The government has set a limit of 2,000 tourists a day when the bay reopens — about half the current number. Boats will no longer be allowed to anchor but must dock on the opposite side of the island.
“Now that the government has this plan, we can’t change it. But we could use this opportunity to tell the world that we do not just have Maya Bay. There are 10 other beautiful beaches and islands around here that tourists can enjoy,” said Watrapol.
Thailand’s efforts to protect certain islands after decades of unregulated tourism began about three years ago under the current military junta, which has banned the types of protests such moves may have sparked had they been announced by civilian governments.
Yoong Island, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Tachai Island in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off-limits to tourists since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said he was amazed by the results. Waters that were devoid of fish are now teeming, he said, and there is about 10,000 square meters (107,600 square feet) of newly recovered coral off one of the islands.
At Maya Bay, park rangers have been preparing a coral propagation program, attaching it to rocks that will be placed in the bay once the tourists are gone.
“We’re almost certain that something good will happen in Maya Bay,” Thon said.

BANGKOK: The daily hordes of tourists have exhausted the Thai beach made famous by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie.
Maya Bay, on Phi Phi Leh island in the Andaman Sea, will be closed to all visitors for four months annually starting this June to allow for the recovery of the battered coral reefs and sea life. The decision to keep visitors away was made Wednesday by Thailand’s National Parks and Wildlife Department.
“It’s like someone who has been working for decades and has never stopped,” said Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a prominent marine scientist and member of Thailand’s national strategy committee on environment development. “Overworked and tired, all the beauty of the beach is gone. We need a timeout for the beach.”
Many Thai marine national parks are closed from mid-May to mid-October, but because of tourist demand, Maya Bay has remained open year-round since a Hollywood crew set foot there in 1999 to film “The Beach,” the dark backpacker tale based on a novel by Alex Garland.
The beach receives an average of 200 boats and 4,000 visitors each day. Recent surveys by a team led by marine biologists found a large part of the coral reefs around the area is gone and sea life has virtually disappeared.
Other Southeast Asian beach resorts are under threat too.
In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has vowed to close Boracay, a small central island popular for its powdery white sand beaches and vibrant nightlife, saying it has become a “cesspool.”
“Their waste would go directly to the ocean. The germ content is already very high there,” Duterte said last week. “It only looks good because of the white coastline.”
His top environmental officials say Boracay may be closed in the last week of April after a 30-day notice is issued and the tropical island placed under a state of calamity to allow the government to extend emergency funds to affected villagers and establishments.
During the closure, which could last six months or less, a massive cleanup is planned and noncompliant beach resorts and other establishments would have to install waste treatment and disposal systems to halt further contamination. Boracay drew more than 1 million tourists last year mostly from Asia, the United States and Europe.
Boracay officials may face administrative cases for allowing environmental laws to be breached for years and for failing to regulate the influx of tourists beyond the island’s capacity.
Thon said the Thai beach’s temporary closing will kick-start the rehabilitation process.
“If you ask me if it is too late to save our islands, the answer is no. But if we don’t do something today, it will be too late,” said Thanya Netithammakum, head of the National Parks and Wildlife Department.
When Maya Bay reopens, the department will set a daily limit of 2,000 tourists, while boats will no longer be allowed to anchor there and will have to dock on the opposite side of the island at floating piers.
The number of visitors the beach has been seeing is unsustainable, and a temporary closure is better than nothing, Thon said.
“The locals know that and we all know that,” he said. “This would be a good way to start managing our tourist destinations. And we can improve on what we learn after the first year. We know that it’s important we manage our resources well. It’s not about more numbers of tourists but about sustainable tourism that benefit locals as well.”
More than 35 million tourists visited Thailand last year, compared to around 10 million when “The Beach” premiered in 2000.
Thai authorities have in the past closed off islands ruined by mass tourism. Koh Yoong, part of the Phi Phi island chain, and Koh Tachai, in the Similan Islands National Park, have been off limits to tourists permanently since mid-2016.
Thon, who surveyed both islands recently, said the results have been amazing. Areas with a bleak sea life environment and coral bleaching are now teeming with robust and colorful sea life and coral, he said. He’s certain that the annual closure will also help restore Maya Bay.
“I have always dreamt that one day we could work to bring her back to life. I have been following and working on Maya Bay for more than 30 years. I had seen it when it was a heaven and I see it when it has nothing left. Anything that we can do to bring this paradise back to Thailand is the dream of a marine biologist,” he said.

IFEROUANE: Tuaregs in northern Niger are hoping to draw tourists back to the region by putting their traditional dances, music poetry and camel races on display.
Despite concerns about Islamic extremism throughout the Sahel region in West Africa, organizers recently hosted more than 1,000 visitors to a cultural festical in Iferouane, a village in Niger’s far north.
“Without tourism, our youth risks falling into idleness and misery, and will join the wave of migration to Europe,” said Mohamed Houma, the mayor of the town located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the central city of Agadez.
The Air festival, considered one of the most important gatherings to celebrate the culture of the Tuareg people, has been held since 2001.
It was marked last month by the sound of tende, the Tuareg style of music and drumming, as the women and men, on foot and on their camels, participated in song and dance competitions.
Since 2001, the gatherings have been held to celebrate the culture of the semi-nomadic Tuareg people. More than 2 million Tuaregs live in the Sahara Desert area, stretching across Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria and Tunisia.
Niger’s Air region, with oases, mountains and sand dunes, has been a destination for adventurous Western tourists since the 1980s and the visitors have been a financial boon for the region. But the tourism has dwindled since the Tuareg rebellion, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, and from the proliferation of armed and extremist groups in the Sahel region.
Security guards watched over the dozen French and Belgian tourists who participated this year’s in Air Festival.
“We are very happy because this festival shows the rest of the world that despite the international geopolitical and security context, we live here in peace, sheltered from the upheavals of some of our neighboring countries,” Houma said.
French tourists to the festival this year included Jacques Maire, a French legislator who heads a France-Niger Friendship group in the French National Assembly.
While the situation in Niger is tense, he said it is not the worst in the region.
“There has always been a strong French appetite for the Sahara,” said Maire. “We must seize every opportunity to recreate tourist flows.”

PHOENIX: Arizona officials on Friday guaranteed that Grand Canyon National Park will remain in full operation if Congress fails to pass a budget and a government shutdown ensues.
Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said the state’s top tourist attraction “will not close on our watch, period.”
Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak says the state’s parks and tourism agencies plan to provide up to $100,000 to ensure lodging, campgrounds and restaurants remain open, and more funding if needed.
The state agencies have been working with the National Park Service to plan for a possible shutdown as early as Saturday if Congress fails to pass a government funding bill. The House passed a temporary government funding bill Thursday night, but the Senate was deadlocked.
President Donald Trump and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer met Friday afternoon in an eleventh-hour effort to avert a shutdown. The impasse is over federal spending and legislation to protect some 700,000 younger immigrants from deportation.
“If Washington, D.C. won’t function, Arizona will,” Ducey said in a statement. “Don’t change your travel plans, because Arizona is open for business — regardless of what happens back in Congress.”
The U.S. Interior Department said national parks and other public lands will remain as accessible as possible if a shutdown happens. That’s a change from previous shutdowns, when most parks were closed and became high-profile symbols of dysfunction.
But spokeswoman Heather Swift said services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds, full-service restrooms and concessions won’t be operating in most locations.
Arizona’s decision to guarantee funding to cover the cost of those services means they should operate at the Grand Canyon as normal if a shutdown occurs.
Arizona paid about $100,000 a day to cover the full cost of keeping the Grand Canyon open during the last shutdown in 2013 but was eventually reimbursed by the federal government. Former Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, worked to pay the National Park Service $651,000 to keep the popular tourist destination open for a week. That came after a shutdown that lasted more than a week.
Federal lawmakers reached an agreement on the budget before those seven days were up.
During a 1995 shutdown, Arizona’s governor famously led a convoy of unarmed troops to the park’s gate to demand it be opened.
They were met there by the park superintendent, who negotiated with then-Gov. Fife Symington, a Republican, for a partial reopening if the budget impasse continued.
The shutdown was briefly solved, but when the parks were again closed a month later, the state paid more than $17,000 a day to keep the road to the Grand Canyon Village and the Mather Point scenic viewpoint on the canyon’s South Rim open.

LAMJUNG: A number of domestic tourists visiting a historical site of Rainaskot in Lamjung district has increased significantly.
Home stay, started after renovation of an earthquake affected houses are now packed with the domestic tourists. It is being run in a total of 14 houses which are built with the modern techniques where 84 tourists can be accommodated at once.
The concept of home stay in Rainaskot begun with American national Natasha Wajniyak providing a fund of Rs 20.75 million to renovate the quake affected houses according to Sarbodaya Old Age Home’s Chairperson Krishna Raj Oliya.
One of the home stay entrepreneurs in Rainaskot, Dilmaya Gurung informed that the domestic tourists are also provided the opportunities of observing the local cultural programs during their stay.
“Besides, tasting the local organic foods, domestic tourists also can experience the local cultures,” said Gurung. Since the Rainaskot has a big Gurung population, a museum related to that caste also has been established.
Meanwhile Rainaskot Tourism Committee’s Chairperson Khadak Bahadur Gurung expressed his hope of attracting even bigger number of the domestic tourists in the future. Visitors can reach the site after two hours of bus ride and three hours of hike from Paudi, a gateway of Lamjung district.
Mesmerizing views of 18 mountain ranges including Annapurna and Machchapuchhre can be seen from the Rainaskot.

MADRID, SPAIN:  A passenger on a delayed Ryanair flight from London who apparently got fed up waiting to get off a plane after it landed in the southern Spanish city of Malaga surprised fellow passengers by using the emergency exit to jump onto a wing.
The incident on New Year’s Day took place 30 minutes after the flight from Stansted Airport landed.
The man, who has not been named but is said to be a non-Spanish citizen, was coaxed back onto the plane while police were called.
Fellow passenger Fernando del Valle Villalobos, who videoed the incident, said he heard the man say he got fed up waiting.
“I was astonished,” del Valle, 25, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
He said the passengers were standing in the aisle waiting to get off the plane when the man “very calmly asked permission to get past, opened the emergency exit, looked out, saw the wing, went back for his back-pack.”
Later, he said the captain came out and asked the man why he had done it and del Valle heard him say clearly that he was sick of waiting inside. The passengers, except the man in question, were kept a further 15 minutes on the plane before being let off.
Police said Wednesday that they have opened a complaint against the man for breaching security.
Ryanair said the incident was now in the hands of Spanish authorities.

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA: While much of the nation shivers in bone-aching cold, people in Alaska’s largest city are basking in warmer weather, jogging in short sleeves, ice-skating in T-shirts or walking dogs while just lightly bundled up.
Anchorage saw an official high of 44 degrees Tuesday, tying the record set in 1981 and 2011. That was warm enough for Patricia Bierer, who was visiting Alaska this winter from Montana.
“I am from the Bitterroot Valley in Montana, and it’s colder there today than it is here in Alaska,” said Bierer, dressed in a pink parka as she strolled with family members around Anchorage’s Westchester Lagoon. “And my children that are there are jealous because I’ve got 40-degree temperatures here.”
National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Kurtz said areas of high and low pressure are working together to push tropical air to the north. But temperatures are expected to begin dropping Tuesday night, and below freezing by Wednesday. That freeze-thaw vacillation should bring slick conditions to the area.
“I jokingly refer to it as freezy, skid stuff,” Kurtz said.
It comes as the weather service issued wind chill advisories and freeze warnings covering a vast area, from South Texas to Canada and from Montana to Maine.

A large swath of the US is freezing under Alaska-like weather, but parts of the nation’s northernmost state itself are basking in balmy conditions. Tuesday’s official temperature hit a record 45 degrees in Anchorage. (Jan. 2)

The unseasonable temperatures brought Anchorage resident Cassandra Sullivan out to walk her pit bull Athena along downtown streets. She said it helped jolt her out of the winter blues.
“For some reason, with the weather out today as it is and just the breeze and the warm air, it kind of brings me out of it,” she said.
Ashley Durst, walking her dog at the downtown lagoon during her lunch break, admitted that the warmer weather was a little unusual because it can be minus-30 this time of the year.
But she doesn’t mind that others are feeling that bite instead. “I just think maybe it’s time they get their little taste of it for a while,” she said with a smile.

LAS VEGAS: Las Vegas welcomed 2018 with fireworks, big-ticket musical acts and unprecedented security in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in US modern history just three months ago.
Law enforcement officers kept a close eye Monday on the estimated 330,000 people who traveled from all over the US and beyond to pack in the Las Vegas Strip and downtown’s Fremont Street. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had every officer working throughout the weekend and was aided by the Nevada National Guard and federal agents.
Rosy-cheeked visitors took selfies and livestreamed the celebration amid temperatures in the mid-40s (4 Celsius), much warmer than most of the US. They wore glittery hats, tiaras and other 2018-themed paraphernalia as they hugged and cheered on the new year.
“One bad incident is not going to deter us from having a good time,” Honolulu resident Pettra Stark, who planned her trip after the Oct. 1 shooting, said while standing underneath the massive video canopy on Fremont Street.
For Stark, the heavy presence of armed officers was reassuring. But not everyone felt the same way, including Adrian Dominguez, who traveled for the festivities with 10 other relatives.
“It’s not pleasant to see so many officers,” Dominguez, a resident of the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Juarez. “They are everywhere.”
The heightened security comes after a high-stakes gambler killed 58 and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below before killing himself.
On Saturday, two security guards were fatally shot while investigating a disturbance at Arizona Charlie’s Decatur, a hotel-casino just west of the Strip. Police said the suspect was hospitalized with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities described it as an isolated incident and assured that it was not terrorism-related.
A roughly eight-minute fireworks display at the top of seven of the city’s world-famous casino-hotels started at the Stratosphere 10 seconds before midnight Monday and continued to Venetian, Treasure Island, Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Aria and MGM Grand. More than 80,000 pyrotechnic firings that illuminated the sky in gold, red and green.
Megastars performed at venues up and down the Strip. The Foo Fighters played at The Chelsea at The Cosmopolitan, Maroon 5 was at the Mandalay Bay Events Center and Britney Spears performed at The Axis at Planet Hollywood.
At a lower-key celebration in downtown Las Vegas’ casino-flanked Fremont Street Experience, bands played under a massive video canopy while visitors danced and sipped giant beers.
Las Vegas police officer Larry Hadfield on Monday said there were no incidents related to the festivities to speak of. The Nevada Highway Patrol on Twitter reported the arrest of two suspected impaired drivers near the Strip.
Police cruisers, dump trucks and other large vehicles blocked key intersections during the night to try to prevent anyone from plowing into crowds.
Strollers, backpacks, large bags, coolers and glass bottles were banned from the Strip for the night. Ticket holders for the celebration on Freemont Street Experienced went through checkpoints where security guards used hand-held metal detectors.
New Year’s Eve is worth an estimated $254.3 million to Las Vegas, according to the city’s Convention and Visitors Authority. More than 97 percent of the destination’s nearly 149,000 hotel and motel rooms were expected to be booked.

Canada is more than just its great mountains, wild moose-spotting road trips and craggy-coast good looks. Its endless variety of landscapes might keep you busy the first few days but what would a traveller look for beyond the great outdoors? Its captivating culture will engulf you; from west to east, a foodie’s paradise your palates would be thoroughly refreshed and thriving cities with their own artistic flair will surprise you. But if you’re looking to weave stories out of adventures for years to come here are a few places that you must check out.

Venture into the woods

If snuggled in a sphere suspended atop the forest canopy of Vancouver Island in the middle of nowhere is what excites you then a visit to the Free Spirit Spheres is a must. It’s part Middle Earth fantasy and part childhood dream, you’ll find large wooden orbs suspended from the trees. Take the spiral staircase and short suspension bridge leading up to them and enter into the sphere to experience nature from a different perspective.
Designed to look vaguely like enormous nuts or seeds, the cedar and spruce spheres borrow from and collaborate with the surrounding environment. The spheres are made of fibreglass and wood, and borrow heavily from sailboat construction methods. Inside the curving walls complete with portholes for windows, space is maximised with fold-out tables and mirrors, curved loft beds and benches, and tiny appliances. Touted as ‘the ultimate tree-house experience,’ these Free Spirit Spheres can be rented overnight.

Brace yourself

Mazes and labyrinths reached its zenith as a form in Renaissance England, more as a device for
entertainment than serious purpose. Today VanDusen Garden in Vancouver is one of only six in North America.
It carries on the tradition of Elizabethan hedge mazes in North America. The maze is made of 3,000 pyramidal cedars — Thuja occidentalis ‘Fastigiata’ to be specific was planted in the autumn of 1981 and slowly grown into the form of the maze one finds today.
Named after local lumber magnate and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen, this garden is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. In addition to the maze, the gardens cover 55 acres and displays plants from around the world. There is an observation terrace from which the less adventuresome visitor can view the maze and the struggles of its confused occupants.

For your eyes only

A book collector’s dream, The Monkey’s Paw in Toronto has the world’s first ‘Biblio-Mat’, a
random book vending machine.  All of the books lining the shelves of Stephen Fowler’s bookstore are ones you couldn’t possibly find anywhere else. He opened The Monkey’s Paw in March 2006 and since then it has been a haven for antiquarians, complete with
medical drawings on the wall and a stuffed crow on a typewriter.
The unusual store, named after a horror short story by author WW Jacobs, has a diverse range of old books. Fowler selects each book to fit these categories: the beautiful, the arcane, the macabre and the absurd. For some its charm may be the custom-made Biblio-Mat, a vending machine that will dispense a randomly selected vintage volume for $2, a surprise you might want to see for yourself.

Fairytale escape

An old world fairytale-land with over 350 fairy folk figurines hidden amongst 800-year old cedars is something that will surely lure you in. Artist Doris Needham and her husband Ernest needed a place to put her hand-sculpted cement creations, so they bought a forest in British Columbia and filled it with enchanted figures from fairytales and nursery rhymes.
When Rogers Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needhams’ unusual haven; one just cannot drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house.
The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage, or a favourite
nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. Take the Nature Walk, a 2-km walk through the lush Canadian forest, where you’ll discover many trees, including an 800-year-old cedar grove. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest tree house in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old
cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.

Jewel in the crown

As their contribution to Montreal’s 1967 World’s Fair Exposition the United States government
commissioned architect, scientist, and well-known genius Buckminster Fuller to design a pavilion for the Canadian exhibition.
Fuller, who popularised, perfected, and named the Geodesic Dome, designed a 20-storey-tall dome in the fashion of his hallmark design to represent the USA. Done in a full two-thirds sphere, rather than the typical half dome, the massive steel structure was seen and admired by over 5.6 million visitors who went into the dome to see exhibits from actual spaceships from the Apollo missions to American works of art.  The dome’s steel skeleton was fitted with a clear acrylic covering, making the structure look like a massive, glittering jewel.
When the fair ended, the pavilion remained, securing the dome’s place in Montreal’s landscape. This relic of the 67 Expo survived fire and ice; it was reopened and was re-purposed as a museum devoted to environmental action. Today the Biosphere of Montreal remains, a sturdy and beautiful example of ‘Bucky’s’ geodesic architecture.

Work of art

Comprised of 15,000 tonnes of snow and 500,000 tonnes of ice, the Hôtel de Glace is a massive undertaking, a stunning yet ephemeral work of art and architecture entirely built of snow and ice. Every winter, this unique hotel is completely redesigned and rebuilt, offering an unforgettable experience in the only hotel of its kind in North America.
Whether for a guided tour, a Nordic overnight stay, a wedding or a private function, the Hôtel de Glace is sure to dazzle visitors with its unique style and spellbinding décor. Guests can choose to enjoy a cocktail served in a glass made of ice or spend the night in one of the 44 theme rooms and suites and relax in the outdoor hot tubs and sauna.
Every inch of the hotel is created out of ice, including the furniture. To make the rooms more liveable, beds are covered with furs, blankets and sleeping bags tested to arctic temperatures. Although you might not get four-star service, the attraction has seduced over a million people around the world since its opening in 2001. Only 4-km from the north end of Québec City
a visit might just add to your Canada experience.  – Compiled

The Nepal Tourism Board  released the song ‘Chahara – ma’ last week to promote tourism in Nepal.
Penned by Nepal’s renowned poet, Viplob Pratik, and sung by  Nhyoo Bajracharya, who also composed it, the song was filmed in different parts of the country. The song reflects the country’s diverse topography with one of the world’s most varying altitudes.
The song has been directed by Soorya Baral, who also performs in the video. Director Baral believes that the song and music video such as this one, and the first of its kind, will no doubt give boost to the domestic tourism in Nepal once it is disseminated properly.

Groups of up to 100 anti-government protesters marked Independence Day with simultaneous demonstrations in the capital, Nur-Sultan, and in the commercial hub Almaty.
They chanted slogans such as “Wake up Kazakhstan!” and held banners that read “Kazakhstan without the Nazarbayev’s” or “Parliamentary republic”. In both cities, protesters were able to rally at initial gathering points, but police then detained dozens of people who tried to march through the streets.
Nazarbayev, 79, handed over the presidency to a handpicked successor in March after nearly three decades in power dating to Soviet times. He still wields broad control, holding a number of official titles including chairman of the security council and leader of the ruling party.
Nazarbayev’s successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has said he would liberalise laws governing protests – which currently make any rally not explicitly sanctioned by the authorities illegal – but such changes have not yet been implemented.

TAKUA PA, THAILAND: Fifteen years after the Indian Ocean tsunami killed more than 230,000 people on Boxing Day, 2004, a cargo container at a police station in southern Thailand bears witness to the hundreds of victims whose remains were never identified.
Inside are personal items – wallets, documents, electronics, all bagged and labelled as evidence – that police hope might one day help to give a name and a proper resting place to those buried nearby in graves marked only by numbers.
“There are still more relatives of the victims, both near and far, that have hopes of finding their lost loved ones,” said Colonel Khemmarin Hassini, deputy police commander in Takua Pa district, one of the areas hardest hit by the tsunami.
Triggered by a massive 9.1-magnitude earthquake, the tsunami killed more than 230,000 people as waves as high as 17.4 meters (57 feet) crashed onto the shores of more than a dozen countries, wiping some communities off the map in seconds.
In Thailand, where more than 5,000 people died, the Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) unit involving police and forensic experts from 30 countries was able to identify more than 3,600 bodies in under two years, the largest and most successful project of its kind.
Colonel Khemmarin was part of that international team, but he said 15 years later a lot of the “communication channels have shut down” and leads had been lost.
“If we are determined enough and reactivate our operations once again, I think some of the 340 unidentified bodies could be identified,” he told Reuters in Takua Pa town.
Hin Temna, 76, who lives in nearby Ban Nam Khem village, lost seven family members killed and his oldest daughter remains missing. They were among more than 1,500 people from the village who died in the disaster.
“There’s no use to keep hoping (I will find my daughter). I don’t think we will,” he said.

398,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/chinese-premier-says-hong-kong-not-yet-out-of-protest-dilemma/,"HONG KONG: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang met with Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam in Beijing on Monday, saying the Asian financial hub was not yet out of the “dilemma” facing the city’s economy after months of sometimes violent protests.
Li met with Lam during a regular duty visit where she is also due to hold a potentially pivotal meeting with President Xi Jinping.
The meetings come after Hong Kong police fired tear gas in late night street clashes with anti-government protesters on Sunday as the former British colony’s worst political crisis in decades drags on into a seventh month.
“Hong Kong right now has not stepped out of its dilemma,” Li said in his meeting with Lam, the opening remarks of which were broadcast by Cable TV. “The SAR (special administrative region) government must continue its efforts, end violence and stop the chaos in accordance with the law and restore order.”

Hong Kong media have speculated that Lam’s talks with Xi could yield fresh directives on the city’s political crisis, including a possible cabinet reshuffle.
The two had previously met in Shanghai in early November when Xi expressed “high trust” in Lam despite the turmoil.
Lam, however, appeared to play down the prospects of a cabinet reshuffle before she left, saying the first task was to curb violence and restore order, while seeking to engage in more dialogue with the public.
Late on Sunday, groups of masked youths – angered by what they see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 – blocked roads around Mong Kok district, prompting police to fire multiple rounds of tear gas and baton charge crowds.
Despite the protesters’ demands and anti-China rhetoric, China maintains it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula granting Hong Kong a large degree of autonomy and liberties, such as freedom of the press, denied in other cities in the mainland.
Press freedom in Hong Kong has come under an accelerating squeeze despite China’s pledges to maintain an open society, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report on Monday.
Large media properties have come under mainland Chinese ownership or influence, while targeted violence has underscored potential dangers for journalists who challenge China’s wishes, the report said.
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN 
The city, home to around 7 million people, entered its first recession in a decade in the third quarter with tourism and retail particularly affected by the sometimes violent protests.
Hong Kong International Airport reported its biggest fall in passenger numbers in more than a decade in November, official data released on Sunday showed.
Lam’s administration has pledged HK$25 billion ($3.2 billion) in stimulus but analysts say it is unlikely to have a major impact as long as the unrest continues.
Some 7,000 licensed retail establishments out of 64,000 say they will be forced to close down in the next six months, the Hong Kong Retail Management Association said earlier this month.
While the number of protests has lessened in recent weeks from demonstrations nearly every day, the movement still enjoys broad backing, with families with children and retirees still coming out in support.
Protesters have called on the government to address their demands which include an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of universal suffrage.

399,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/student-protests-against-indias-citizenship-law-spread-after-clashes-on-campuses/,"NEW DELHI: Protests over a new citizenship law based on religion spread to student campuses across India on Monday as critics said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government was pushing a partisan agenda in conflict with India’s founding as a secular republic.
Anger with Modi’s Hindu nationalist government was further fuelled by allegations of police brutality at Jamia Millia Islamia university on Sunday, when officers entered the campus in the capital New Delhi and fired tear gas to break up a protest. At least 100 people were injured in the clashes there.
There were similar scenes at the Aligarh Muslim University in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where police also clashed with protesters on the campus.

Hundreds of activists gathered outside the New Delhi police headquarters on Sunday night to protest against alleged police brutality and the detention of students.
The most violent protests during the past few day took place in the northeastern state of Assam, where mobs torched buildings and train stations, angry the law would help thousands of immigrants from Bangladesh become lawful citizens. At least two people were killed in the violent clashes with police.
Under the law passed by parliament last week, religious minorities such as Hindus and Christians in neighbouring Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who have settled in India prior to 2015 will have a path to Indian citizenship on grounds they faced persecution in those countries.
Critics say the law, which does not make the same provision for Muslims, weakens India’s secular foundations.
Protests were held in Mumbai’s Indian Institute of Technology and Tata Institute of Social Sciences overnight and on Monday and more were planned at Bombay University and in the southern city of Bengaluru later in the day.
Students said they also stood in solidarity with fellow student in Delhi who clashed with police in Delhi on Sunday.
“The country is burning, the government has made a mockery of the constitution,” said D. Raja, a general secretary of the Communist Party of India.

— Konkona Sensharma (@konkonas) December 15, 2019

Some Bollywood celebrities like actress Konkona Sen Sharma, and directors Mahesh Bhatt and Anubhav Sinha, also criticised the police action on Twitter, and called on others to speak up.
“We are with the students! Shame on you @DelhiPolice,” Sen Sharma tweeted.
Anger with Modi’s Hindu nationalist government over the citizenship act has erupted for two reasons. In Assam, and other northeastern states bordering Bangladesh, people upset over the impact that a large influx of migrants is having on society, and the pressure it places on their land.
In the capital New Delhi and other urban centres, opposition political activists and student leaders are angry over a law that they say erodes India’s secular foundations.
Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party denies any religious bias but says it is opposed to the appeasement of one community. It says the new law is meant to help minority groups facing persecution in the three nearby Muslim countries.
Modi has said the law has been passed by parliament and there is no going back on it He told a rally on Sunday the decision was “1000 percent correct.”

Firefighters recovered 10 bodies as the fire ripped through the three-storey factory at Gazipur, on the outskirts of Dhaka, local police official, Jabedul Islam, said.
It was not immediately clear how many workers were inside the factory when the fire broke out and what caused the blaze, he added.
“Firefighters are still searching inside the factory” Islam said, adding it took scores of firefighters two hours to bring the fire under control.
The blaze comes four days after a devastating fire at a plastics factory, operating without proper government permissions, just outside Dhaka killed at least 19 people.
Such accidents in factories, many of which operate illegally and without proper fire safety measures, are common in Bangladesh.
The Rana Plaza factory collapse in 2013 killed more than 1,100 workers and a fire in a garment factory in 2012 killed 112 people.

The protesters clashed with police who used tear gas and baton charges to disperse demonstrators at a major university in Delhi.
Likewise, tensions remained high at the epicenre of the unrest in Assam state’s biggest city, Guwahati, with troops patrolling the streets on Sunday.
In Assam, four people died after being shot by police, while another was killed when a shop he was sleeping in was set on fire and a sixth after he was beaten up during a protest, officials said.
Some 5,000 people took part in a fresh demonstration on Sunday in Guwahati, with hundreds of police watching as they sang, chanted and carried banners with the words “long live Assam”.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government says the new law will save religious minorities such as Hindus and Christians from persecution in neighbouring Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan by offering them a path to Indian citizenship. But critics say the law, which does not make the same provision for Muslims, weakens India‘s secular foundations.
Sunday was the fifth straight day of protests across the country against the law enacted earlier this month, and the third day running in the capital.

Police tried to contain thousands of protesters, including locals and students, who had gathered near the Jamia Millia Islamia University in southeast Delhi. Clashes erupted and authorities said protesters torched buses, cars and motorbikes.
Officials at two local hospitals said more than 100 people with injuries had been brought in following the clashes.
“Many of them have fracture injuries. We are running out of plaster of paris for casts,” said Inamul Hassan, an official at the Alshifa Hospital located near the university, adding more than 80 people with injuries had been brought to the hospital.
A spokesman for Holy Family Hospital told Reuters’ partner agency ANI that it had treated 26 students suffering from minor injuries.

Police resorted to baton charges and firing tear gas on the protesters to disperse them, according to a Reuters witness. Officers stormed the campus grounds to confront protesters they said fled into the university and threw stones at police.
“About 4000 people were protesting and police did what they did to disperse them when the crowd burnt buses,” said Chinmoy Biswal, a senior police officer in the area. “If it had been a peaceful mob it would have been dispersed peacefully.”
He added that police entered the campus to maintain order and that six officers had been wounded in the clashes.
However some students and officials at Jamia Millia, a storied institution almost 100 years old, decried the police action.
“Police have entered the campus by force, no permission was given. Our staff and students are being beaten up and forced to leave the campus,” Waseem Ahmed Khan, a senior faculty member of the university, told ANI.
Student Tehreem Mirza said students took shelter in the library after police on the campus fired tear gas.

BJP-CONGRESS BLAME GAME
The protests have raged particularly in some eastern states such as Assam, Tripura and West Bengal, where resentment towards Bangladeshi immigrants has persisted for decades.
Authorities have shut down internet access in several parts of the affected states in an attempt to maintain law and order.
Modi, speaking at a rally in the eastern state of Jharkhand on Sunday, blamed the opposition Congress party and its allies for inciting violence against the citizenship law.
The Congress party in turn slammed Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party on Twitter saying, the government “has failed at its duty to maintain peace in the nation.”
Local authorities ordered all schools in southeast Delhi to remain closed on Monday. Jamia Millia university had already said, on Saturday, that it was closing early for the winter break. The Aligarh Muslim University in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh also announced that it was shutting early for the break after student protesters clashed with police on Sunday.
Hundreds of activists gathered outside the New Delhi police headquarters on Sunday night to protest against alleged police brutality and the detention of students.
A lawyer, who is trying to negotiate the release of detained students, said at least 28 were being held at one police station in South Delhi. A police spokesman did not respond to a call, or message asking about the number of people detained.
Meanwhile, protests against the law continued in parts of eastern India. A highway connecting West Bengal and Assam was blocked in several places on Sunday when protesters burnt tyres, demanding the law be scrapped. Violence was also reported in Patna, the capital of the eastern state of Bihar.

402,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/in-reversal-hallmark-will-reinstate-same-sex-marriage-ads/,"NEW YORK: The Hallmark Channel, reversing what it called a “wrong decision,” said Sunday it will reinstate same-sex marriage commercials that it had pulled following a complaint from a conservative group.
The earlier decision by Crown Media, Hallmark’s parent company, to pull several ads for the wedding planning site Zola featuring two brides kissing at the altar had caused a storm of protest on social media. Celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres and William Shatner criticized the move and the hashtag #BoycottHallmark was trending on Twitter at one point.
“The Crown Media team has been agonizing over this decision as we’ve seen the hurt it has unintentionally caused,” said a statement issued Sunday evening by Hallmark Cards CEO Mike Perry. “Said simply, they believe this was the wrong decision. … We are truly sorry for the hurt and disappointment this has caused.”
Zola, the wedding planning site that made the ads, said it was relieved that the decision to pull them had been reversed. In an email to The Associated Press, the company said it would be in touch with Hallmark “regarding a potential return to advertising.”
“We are humbled by everyone who showed support not only for Zola, but for all LGBTQ couples families who express their love on their wedding day, and every day,” said a statement Sunday evening from the company’s chief marketing officer, Mike Chi.
The LGBT advocacy group GLAAD also expressed relief at the reversal. Its president, Sarah Kate Ellis, said Hallmark’s “decision to correct its mistake sends an important message to LGBTQ people and represents a major loss for fringe organizations like One Million Moms, whose sole purpose is to hurt families like mine.”

It was a complaint by One Million Moms, part of the American Family Association, that had led to the initial decision to pull the the Zola ads.  A post on the group’s website Saturday said that Crown Media CEO Bill Abbott “reported the advertisement aired in error.” The group also wrote: “The call to our office gave us the opportunity to confirm the Hallmark Channel will continue to be a safe and family-friendly network.”
Zola had submitted six ads, with four including a lesbian couple. After Hallmark pulled those ads, but not two featuring only opposite-sex couples, Zola pulled its remaining ads.
Molly Biwer, senior vice president for public affairs at Hallmark, said in an interview Sunday night that from the time the initial decision had been made, “Crown Media had been in agony over the hurt that this had caused. Hallmark has an unwavering commitment to diversity and inclusion.”
She added that the reversal, and not the original decision, “truly reflects who we are as a company. We celebrate all families.”
Hallmark’s statement said the network will be “working with GLAAD to better represent the LGBTQ community” and would be reaching out to Zola to reestablish its partnership.
“Across our brand, we will continue to look for ways to be more inclusive and celebrate our differences,” Perry said.
In one of the pulled ads, two brides stand at the altar and wonder aloud whether their wedding would be going more smoothly if they had used a planning site like Zola. The lighthearted ad ends with the just-married couple sharing a quick kiss.
DeGeneres had quickly assailed the original decision, asking on Twitter: “Isn’t it almost 2020?” Actress Sandra Bernhard, who played one of the first openly bisexual characters on network TV in “Roseanne,” had also criticized the move.
“All the groovy gay ladies i know won’t be watching your Christmas schlock,” she wrote on Twitter, addressing Hallmark.
The Hallmark decision was also mocked on “Saturday Night Live,” and Netflix US tweeted stills from a TV show and movie that it labeled “Titles Featuring Lesbians Joyfully Existing And Also It’s Christmas Can We Just Let People Love Who They Love.”

403,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/hong-kong-mall-protests-flare-with-leader-lam-in-beijing/,"HONG KONG: Small groups of anti-government protesters gathered in shopping malls across Hong Kong on Sunday amid sporadic scuffles with riot police, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam away on a visit to Beijing.
In the peak shopping season ahead of Christmas, groups of masked protesters, clad in black, marched through malls chanting slogans including “Fight for freedom” and “Return justice to us”.
In the Telford Plaza mall in Kowloon Bay, skirmishes broke out with riot police, who used pepper spray on crowds and wrestled several people to the ground before taking them away.
In Shatin, police fired one tear gas canister outside the New Town Plaza mall, and took away several people, according to media reports, after some entrances and walkways were blocked, glass panels smashed, and graffiti sprayed.
The police said in a statement that some shops had been damaged and that a smoke bomb had been set off. Many shops closed early.
Hong Kong has been embroiled in its worst political crisis in decades since June with anti-government protests posing a populist challenge to China’s leader Xi Jinping, complicating ties between China and the United States at a time of heightened tensions including over trade.
Demonstrators have railed against what they see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
They also say they are responding to excessive use of force by police. Last Sunday, a protest march drew around 800,000 people, according to organisers, suggesting the movement still has significant public support.
On Hong Kong island, several hundred people, many social workers, gathered peacefully to reiterate demands that include full democracy and an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality. Some called for more strikes, while others sat at tables to write Christmas cards to those who have been jailed.
“One of our goals is defending social justice,” said Chan, a 20-year-old studying to become a social worker. “We have tried every measure to express our voices … but the government still doesn’t listen. We haven’t put enough pressure.”
Separately, a pro-government rally drew over a thousand people nearby.
“We don’t support any violence in Hong Kong,” said Lee Man-kan, a 54-year-old solicitor.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam is in Beijing where she is due to meet Xi on Monday.
Some observers say the visit could yield fresh directives including a possible cabinet reshuffle of key local officials. Lam, however, seemed to play that down before she left, saying the first task was to curb violence and restore order.
The government is also planning more public dialogue through social media channels, as well as a second planned town hall session with top officials to try to bridge differences.
Despite the febrile public mood, China maintains it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula granting Hong Kong autonomy and says it fully supports Lam.

404,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/italian-city-evacuates-54000-people-to-defuse-ww2-bomb/,"MILAN: Around 54,000 people were evacuated from the southern Italian city of Brindisi on Sunday as experts worked to defuse a World War Two bomb, authorities said.
Corriere della Sera daily said the operation was the biggest peacetime evacuation in Italy, with more than 60% of the city‘s residents forced to vacate a “red zone” in a radius of 1,617 metres from where the bomb was found.
The British bomb, believed to have been dropped on the city in 1941, is 1 metre long and contains 40 kgs of dynamite, authorities said. It was found by chance last month during refurbishment works at a cinema theatre.
The city‘s airport, train station, two hospitals and prison were shut down and evacuated as part of the operation, which authorities expect to be completed around lunchtime.

405,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/deadly-eruption-hits-new-zealand-volcano-tourist-town-hard/,"WHAKATANE:  Helicopter pilot Mark Law did not hesitate to fly out to New Zealand‘s White Island volcano immediately after it erupted to carry survivors to hospital, but after a harrowing week he knows his town‘s adventure tourism industry faces an uncertain future.
New Zealand Police Search and Rescue and Disaster Victim Identification staff return to Whakatane Airport after conducting a search for bodies in the aftermath of the eruption of White Island volcano, which is also known by its Maori name Whakaari, December 15, 2019. Photo: Reuters
As the search continues for the final two missing bodies from Monday’s deadly eruption, Law knows it will be challenging for his business, Kahu Helicopters. Some of his seven staff, including three pilots, could lose their jobs.
“We’re going to be greatly affected, we’re anticipating probably damn near shutting the doors. It’s going to be devastating, we’ve been operating that part of our business for years,” he said.
Law is not alone worrying about his future in Whakatane, a picturesque town of 35,000 of the shore of the Bay of Plenty that is the main access point to the volcanic island.
Anne Tolley, the local member of parliament, said the town was shattered by the disaster and its thoughts were with the victims, but hoped that tours would one day restart.
“It is iconic and it is certainly is the centrepiece of the town’s tourism. We also have fantastic beaches and walks and the kiwi, but Whakaari, you will have seen all the signs, we are the gateway to Whakaari,” Tolley told Reuters, using the Māori name for the volcano. Daily tours had taken more than 10,000 visitors every year to privately owned island 50km (30 miles) off the coast.
Tours to the island were part of Whakatane’s history, and operators had been gearing up for the peak Christmas holiday season before Monday’s disaster, Tolley said.
“It’s very difficult coming at probably the busiest time of year for them. It will be devastating.”
RESCUE
On Monday, the 48-year-old Law had quickly organised three other pilots to fly out to the island, where they picked up 10 badly burned people and flew them back to Whakatane’s hospital.
Law and his team tried to fly back to the island to recover the bodies of those they knew had died, but were “tremendously disappointed” to be stopped by police.
After initially being sidelined from police operations, by mid-week Law was sharing his knowledge of the volcano‘s terrain and environment with the military squad that on Friday retrieved six of the eight bodies left behind. On the weekend, the search continued for the remaining bodies.
“At the end of the day people on the ground generally know and it is important… to weave into the plan the effort of the local people,” Law told Reuters.
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
Shock had ripped through Whakatane at the eruption, with the local hospital overwhelmed as dozens of seriously injured people were delivered from the island.
Whakatane’s tourism sector had been growing strongly with the unique marine volcano at its heart, but with the prospect that people may be reluctant to visit the island even if it is reopened, immediate prospects will be challenging.
As the recovery mission on Friday played out, Boz Te Moana, 24, and Michael Mika, 28, waited to support their community gathered in the indigenous Māori marae, or meeting ground.
The two, who had travelled from their homes further up the Whakatane River, hoped in time tours to the waters around the island would be allowed again but tourists should not step foot on it again, out of respect for the dead, they said.
“I don’t know if the mamae or the hurt will ever change, but the environment, it’s up to the town itself to move forward from here in the most positive way,” said Te Moana, using the Māori word for pain.

406,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/strong-quake-causes-damage-injuries-in-southern-philippines/,"MANILA: A powerful earthquake struck near the Philippine city of Davao on Sunday, damaging buildings and causing several injuries, officials said, the latest in a series of tremors to strike the southern part of the country in recent months.
The magnitude 6.8 quake was centred 61 km (38 miles) southwest of Davao on the island of Mindanao, at a depth of 28.2 km, the U.S. Geological Survey said, revising down the magnitude from an earlier 6.9.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat from the quake, based on available data.
Anthony Allada, public information officer of Magsaysay Town in Davao del Sur province, near the epicentre, said 14 people were injured but none seriously. Roads and buildings, including the local government office, were damaged and power was out in the town, he said.
The region was shaken by four powerful quakes in October and November, which together killed at least 20 people.
“We don’t know what to do anymore. Do we respond first or attend to our families first?”, Allada told DZMM radio.
President Rodrigo Duterte, who is from Davao, was in the city when the quake struck.
“He is ok. He and his daughter Kitty were in their house when the quake struck,” presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said. “First Lady Honeylet was on her way home when the ground trembled. She said her car was swaying. She is unhurt.”
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said damage and aftershocks could be expected.
Several strong aftershocks were recorded after the main tremor, the strongest a magnitude 5.7 centred north of General Santos City.
Radio DZMM reported power was out in General Santos City, where patients at a local hospital were being evacuated.
Video footage of the latest quake posted by users on Twitter showed overhead electrical wires swaying and erupting in a shower of sparks. Another video showed water sloshing out of a hotel swimming pool.
One picture said to be from Padada, in Davao del Sur, showed a building collapsed onto a car. Reuters could not immediately verify the pictures but the local disaster agency reported one three-story building had collapsed. There was no information if any people were inside or under the building.

409,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/north-korea-says-new-tests-will-help-it-counter-us-threats/,"SEOUL: North Korea said it successfully performed another “crucial test” at its long-range rocket launch site that will further strengthen its nuclear deterrent.
The test — the second at the facility in a week, according to North Korea’s Academy of Defense Science — possibly involved technologies to improve intercontinental ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the continental United States.
Pak Jong Chon, chief of the Korean People’s Army’s general staff, asserted on Saturday that North Korea has built up “tremendous power” and that the findings from the recent tests would be used to develop new weapons to allow the country to “definitely and reliably” counter US nuclear threats.
The North in recent weeks has been dialling up pressure to coax major concessions from the Trump administration as it approaches an end-of-year deadline set by leader Kim Jong Un to salvage faltering nuclear negotiations.
The Academy of Defense Science did not specify what was tested on Friday. Just days earlier, the North said it conducted a “very important test” at the site on the country’s northwestern coast, prompting speculation that it involved a new engine for either an ICBM or a space launch vehicle.
The testing activity and defiant statements suggest that the North is preparing to do something to provoke the United States if Washington doesn’t back down and make concessions to ease sanctions and pressure on Pyongyang in deadlocked nuclear negotiations.
Stephen Biegun, the US special representative for North Korea, was to arrive in Seoul on Sunday for discussions with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and other officials. It was unclear whether Biegun would attempt contact with North Korean officials at the inter-Korean border, which has often been used as a diplomatic venue, or whether such an effort would be successful.
“Genuine peace can be safeguarded and our development and future be guaranteed only when the balance of power is completely ensured. We have stored up a tremendous power,” Pak said in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.
“We should be ready to cope with political and military provocations of the hostile forces and be familiar with both dialogue and confrontation,” Pak said. “Our army is fully ready to thoroughly carry out any decision of the supreme leader with action. … US and other hostile forces will spend the year-end in peace only when they hold off any words and deeds rattling us.”
Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean military officer and currently an analyst from Seoul’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the North mentioning its nuclear deterrent makes it clear it tested a new engine for an ICBM, not a satellite-launch vehicle. Kim said it was notable that North Korea announced the specific length of the test, which he said possibly signals a more advanced design for a liquid-fuel multistage ICBM that can carry larger payloads with more stability.
North Korea’s current ICBMs, including the Hwasong-15, are built with first stages that are powered by a pair of engines that experts say are modelled after Russian designs. When the North first tested the engine in 2016, it said the test lasted for 200 seconds and demonstrated a thrust of 80 tons-force.

During a provocative run of weapons tests in 2017, Kim Jong Un conducted three flight tests of ICBMs that demonstrated potential range to reach deep into the US mainland, raising tensions and triggering verbal warfare with President Donald Trump as they exchanged crude insults and threats of nuclear annihilation.
Experts say that the North would need further tests to establish the missile’s performance and reliability, such as improving its accuracy and ensuring that the warheads survive the harsh conditions of atmospheric reentry.
Relations between Kim and Trump became cozier in 2018 after Kim initiated diplomacy that led to their first summit in June that year in Singapore, where they issued a vague statement on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, without describing when or how it would occur.
But negotiations faltered after the United States rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North’s nuclear capabilities at Kim’s second summit with Trump in Vietnam in February.
Trump and Kim met for a third time in June at the border between North and South Korea and agreed to resume talks. But an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what the North Koreans described as the Americans’ “old stance and attitude.”
Kim, who unilaterally suspended nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests last year during talks with Washington and Seoul, has said North Korea could seek a “new path” if the United States persists with sanctions and pressure against the North.
North Korea has also conducted 13 rounds of ballistic missile and rocket artillery tests since May, and has hinted at lifting its moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests if the Trump administration fails to make substantial concessions before the new year.
Some experts doubt that Kim would revive the tensions of 2017 by restarting nuclear and ICBM tests, which would cross a metaphorical “red line” and risk shattering his hard-won diplomacy with Washington. They say Kim is likely to pressure Trump with military activities that pose less of a direct threat to the US and by bolstering a united front with Beijing and Moscow. Both are the North’s allies and have called for the UN Security Council to consider easing sanctions on Pyongyang to help nuclear negotiations move forward.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government says the new law will save religious minorities such as Hindus and Christians from persecution in neighbouring Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan by offering them a path to Indian citizenship. But critics say the law, which does not make the same provision for Muslims, weakens the secular foundations of India.
The law‘s enactment has stirred up protests across India, but the eastern part of the country, where movements against Bangladeshi immigrants have raged for decades, has been among the worst hit.
On Saturday, protesters torched at least 15 buses on an expressway in West Bengal state, some 20 km (12 miles) from state capital Kolkata, holding up traffic for several hours, two police officials said.
At least half a dozen railway stations in the state were vandalised and set on fire, leading to the cancellation of many long-distance trains, Sanjoy Ghosh, chief public relations Officer at South Eastern Railway told Reuters, adding it was difficult to say when normal services would resume.
In India‘s most populous Uttar Pradesh state, in the north of the country, students at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), a prominent institution set up in 1920, protested against the citizenship law and were mobilising Muslims via doorstep invitations for a bigger protest on Sunday.
“With the passing of this bill the Muslim community is scared and this bill, which is now a law, is discriminatory in nature,” said Sharjeel Usmani, an undergraduate student at AMU. “We will protest against it till it is taken back.”
Protests were also staged in several other towns and cities of Uttar Pradesh, including in the Hindu holy city of Prayagraj, whose former name Allahabad was changed by the state’s Hindu nationalist government in 2018.
In the heart of India‘s capital New Delhi, hundreds of students gathered within and outside the gates of the Jamia Milia University, making speeches and holding peaceful protests against the citizenship law amid a heavy police presence.
Police on Friday fired tear gas and used baton charges to disperse scores of students demonstrating at Jamia.
The university on Saturday also declared a 20-day winter break beginning December 16, according to an official notice reviewed by Reuters.
The annual break at Jamia usually begins around December 24 and the decision to go on an early break was taken due to the student protests, a Jamia staff member said, declining to be named.

The Nobel laureate waved as her black car drove slowly past crowds who waved flags, held up pictures of her face and shouted jubilant greetings.
“Mother Suu went to the court on behalf of the country,” local farmer Khin Maung Shwe told Reuters. “Actually the accusation was against the army. But she took the first step of responsibility as a leader of the nation.”
Gambia has accused Myanmar of violating the 1948 Genocide Convention over a military campaign that drove more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar. It has asked the International Court of Justice to order “provisional measures” to prevent more harm.
Suu Kyi led a team to the Netherlands for three days of hearings, during which she denied genocide and argued the UN court should not have jurisdiction.
“Myanmar requests the court to remove the case from its list,” Suu Kyi said on the final day of hearings on Thursday. “In the alternative (the court should) reject the request for provisional measures submitted by the Gambia.”
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate’s surprise decision to attend the hearings in person has dealt a further blow to her tarnished international reputation.
Suu Kyi was long feted in the West as a champion of human rights and democracy, and was a high-profile political prisoner during 15 years of house arrest for her opposition to Myanmar‘s then ruling military junta.
But her stance on the Rohingya issue has seen her stripped of many awards, calls for the Nobel committee to revoke her peace prize and strong criticism from former celebrity supporters and other organizations.
At home however, Suu Kyi, the daughter of Myanmar‘s founding father Aung San, is still revered by many.
The proceedings in the Hague have galvanized supporters, who have staged rallies across the country chanting “Stand with Suu Kyi” and waving flags.

412,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/boris-johnson-heads-north-to-celebrate-crushing-election-win/,"LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was heading to northern England on Saturday to meet newly elected Conservative Party lawmakers in the working class heartland that turned its back on the opposition Labour Party in this week’s election and helped give him an 80-seat majority.
In a victory speech outside 10 Downing Street on Friday, Johnson called for an end to the acrimony that has festered throughout the country since the divisive 2016 Brexit referendum, and urged Britain to “let the healing begin.”
Johnson’s campaign mantra to “get Brexit done” and widespread unease with the leadership style and socialist policies of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn combined to give the ruling Conservatives 365 seats in the House of Commons, its best performance since party icon Margaret Thatcher’s last victory in 1987. Labour slumped to 203 seats, its worst showing since 1935.
While Johnson was on a victory lap Saturday, Corbyn — who has pledged to stand down next year — was under fire from within his own party.
Former lawmaker Helen Goodman, one of many Labour legislators to lose their seat in northern England, told BBC radio that “the biggest factor was obviously the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn as the leader.”
Armed with his hefty new majority, Johnson is set to start the process next week of pushing Brexit legislation through Parliament to ensure Britain leaves the EU by the January 31 deadline. Once he’s passed that hurdle — breaking three years of parliamentary deadlock — he has to seal a trade deal with the bloc by the end of 2020.
Johnson owes his success, in part, to traditionally Labour-voting working class constituencies in northern England that backed the Conservatives because of the party’s promise to deliver Brexit. During the 2016 referendum, many of those communities voted to leave the EU because of concerns that immigrants were taking their jobs and neglect by the central government in London.

413,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/ex-sudan-strongman-al-bashir-gets-2-years-for-corruption/,"KHARTOUM: A court in Sudan convicted former President Omar al-Bashir of money laundering and corruption on Saturday, sentencing him to two years in a rehabilitation facility.
That’s the first verdict in a series of legal proceedings against al-Bashir, who is also wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide linked to the Darfur conflict in the 2000s.
The verdict came a year after Sudanese protesters first began their revolt against al-Bashir’s authoritarian rule. During his three decades in power, Sudan landed on the U.S. list for sponsoring terrorism, and the country’s economy has been battered by years of mismanagement and American sanctions.
Al-Bashir has been in custody since April, when Sudan’s military stepped in and removed him from power after months of nationwide protests. The uprising eventually forced the military into a power-sharing agreement with civilians.
Under Sudanese law, al-Bashir, 75, is to be sent to a state-run rehabilitation facility for elderly people who are convicted of crimes not punishable with death.
Before the verdict was read, supporters of al-Bashir briefly disrupted the proceedings and were pushed out of the courtroom by security forces.
The former strongman was charged earlier this year with money laundering, after millions of U.S. dollars, euros and Sudanese pounds were seized in his home shortly after his ouster.
Sudan’s military has said it would not extradite him to the ICC. The country’s military-civilian transitional government has so far not indicated whether they will hand him over to the The Hague.
The corruption trial is separate from charges against al-Bashir regarding the killing of protesters during the uprising.
Anti-government demonstrations initially erupted last December over steep price rises and shortages, but soon shifted to calls for al-Bashir to step down. Security forces responded with a fierce crackdown that killed dozens of protesters in the months prior his ouster.
Saturday’s verdict, which capped monthslong trial, could be appealed before a higher court.
In August, al-Bashir told the court that he received through his office manager $25 million from Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.
He said the crown prince did not want to reveal that he was the source of the funds, so he did not deposit the money in the country’s central bank.
He said the money was being used for donations not for his own benefit. At least $2 million dollars went to a military hospital and $3 million to a Sudanese university, he said.
Al-Bashir said $5 million was given to the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary unit that grew out of the feared Janjaweed militias unleashed during the Darfur conflict in the 2000s.
The RSF is led by Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who is also a member of the newly appointed Sovereign Council that is to rule Sudan during a three-year transition.
Protesters accuse the RSF of leading the crackdown against them that started with the brutal break-up of their sit-in camp in Khartoum earlier in June.
Al-Bashir did not provide documents or records for the spending.

414,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/new-zealand-divers-attempt-to-recover-last-2-volcano-victims/,"WHAKATANE, NEW ZEALAND: Police divers working in near zero visibility in contaminated waters around New Zealand’s volcanic White Island tried Saturday to find the remaining two victims of an eruption that left at least 16 dead and dozens severely burned.
Ash and other fallout from Monday’s eruption has made the sea near the island toxic and divers have to be washed clean after every completed dive. Police Deputy Commissioner John Tims called search conditions “unique and challenging.”

“Divers have reported seeing a number of dead fish and eels washed ashore and floating in the water. Conditions in the water today are not optimal with between zero and 2 metres visibility depending on location,” he said.
Navy divers are expected to join the police search effort later Saturday.
Military specialists on Friday recovered six bodies from the island in a carefully planned but risky operation. Two more bodies of victims known to have been on the island could not be located during the four-hour operation, carried out by bomb disposal experts — six men and two women — wearing yellow hazmat suits and breathing apparatuses.
Police believe one of the missing bodies was sighted in the water close to the island by rescue teams on Tuesday, the day after the eruption. The location of the other body is not known.
Divers began the search for the bodies on Friday but were forced to stop near evening when weather conditions deteriorated. An aerial search of the island was suspended at nightfall.
The six bodies were transported to Auckland for identification.
In a statement, police said their own experts, forensic pathologists, scientists, odontologists and coroner’s officials were involved in the work of identification. Under New Zealand law, the coroner must confirm the victims’ identities.
Police said the process may take some time, though they are working as quickly as possible to return the bodies to their families.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called on New Zealanders to observe a minute’s silence in memory of victims of the disaster at 2:11 pm on Monday, exactly a week from the eruption. Ardern and her Cabinet will pause in silence during their regular meeting at Parliament in Wellington.
“Wherever you are in New Zealand or around the world, this is a moment we can stand alongside those who have lost loved ones in this extraordinary tragedy,” Ardern said. “Together we can express our sorrow for those who have died and been hurt and our support for their grieving families and friends.”
The bodies recovered Friday are thought to be of Australians, who were most of the visitors to the island when the volcano erupted. The two last victims are believed to be New Zealanders — a tour guide and a boat captain who had taken tourists to the island.
Scientists have warned that White Island, which is the exposed tip of a mostly undersea volcano, is highly volatile, and has been venting steam and mud regularly.
The eruption Monday occurred as 47 tourists and their guides were exploring the island.
Of the 15 injured, 11 are in “very critical” condition. All 13 Australians who suffered burns have been returned to Australia, he said.
Husband and wife Pratap and Mayuri Singh were confirmed Saturday to be among survivors. The Atlanta couple are recovering from burns in Auckland’s Middlemore Hospital where their conditions were listed as stable.
Specialist medical teams were heading to New Zealand from Australia, Britain and the United States. Skin banks were also sending tissue to New Zealand hospitals to use for grafts.
Authorities say 24 Australians, nine Americans, five New Zealanders, four Germans, two Britons, two Chinese and a Malaysian were on the island at the time. Many were from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship that had left Sydney two days earlier.

415,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/clashes-erupt-in-delhi-over-citizenship-law-japan-prime-minister-shinzo-abe-cancels-visit/,"NEW DELHI: Violent clashes erupted in Delhi between police and hundreds of university students on Friday over the enactment of a new citizenship law that critics say undermines India’s secular foundations.
The unrest has already led Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to cancel a planned visit to India from Sunday.
The new law offers a way to Indian citizenship for six minority religious groups from neighbouring Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan including Hindus and Christians, but not Muslims.
A police officer fires a teargas shell towards protestors during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Bill, a bill that seeks to give citizenship to religious minorities persecuted in neighbouring Muslim countries, outside the Jamia Millia Islamia University in New Delhi, India, on December 13, 2019.

Police fired tear gas and used baton charges to disperse scores of students demonstrating at Jamia Millia Islamia university in the heart of Delhi over the law.
Protesters attacked cars in the capital, and several people were injured and taken to hospital.
Zakir Riyaz, a PhD student in social work, said the new law made a mockery of India’s religious openness.
“It goes against the whole idea of a secular India,” he said, speaking by phone from the Holy Family Hospital in New Delhi where 15 of his fellow students were admitted after being injured in a police baton charge.
Police barricades were knocked down and streets were strewn with shoes and broken bricks. An official at the university dispensary said that more than 100 students had been brought in with injuries but all had been discharged.
Parvez Hashmi, a local politician who went to the protest site to speak to police, said about 50 students had been detained.
Students said it was meant to be a peaceful protest, with them trying to go from Jamia University to Parliament Street to show their opposition to the legislation. But police pushed them back, leading to clashes.
Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government say it is promoting a Hindu-first agenda for India and that the citizenship law excluding Muslims showed a deep-seated bias against India’s 170 million Muslims.
Imran Chowdhury, a researcher, said “either give citizenship to refugees of all religions or none at all. The constitution is being tampered with in the name of religion.”
Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party denies any religious bias but says it is opposed to the appeasement of one community. It says the new law is meant to help minority groups facing persecution in the three nearby Muslim countries.

ABE CANCELS
The United Nations human rights office voiced concern that the new law is “fundamentally discriminatory in nature”, and called for it to be reviewed.
Two people were killed in India’s Assam state on Thursday when police opened fire on mobs torching buildings and attacking railway stations in protest at the new citizenship rules signed into law on Thursday.
Japan‘s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cancelled a trip to Assam for a summit with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi that had been due to begin on Sunday.
Japan has stepped up infrastructure development work in Assam in recent years, which the two sides were expected to highlight during the summit. Abe had also planned to visit a memorial in the nearby state of Manipur where Japanese soldiers were killed in World War Two.
“With reference to the proposed visit of Japanese PM @AbeShinzo to India, both sides have decided to defer the visit to a mutually convenient date in the near future,” Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in a tweet.
Japan‘s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said both countries would decide on the appropriate timing for the visit although nothing has been decided yet.
A movement against immigrants from Bangladesh has raged in Assam for decades. Protesters there say granting Indian nationality to more people will further strain the state’s resources and lead to the marginalisation of indigenous communities.

Marin became the Nordic country’s prime minister on Tuesday, and two days later found herself rubbing shoulders at a European Union summit with leaders of 27 countries, including the powerful figures of Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen beamed and embraced Marin warmly as they met at the Brussels summit.
The appointment of a youthful woman to lead her country has been seized on by media around the globe, many of them seeing in her a “role model” for others living in societies where politics have long been dominated by older men.
“I don’t feel like a role model,” she said in an interview. “I might be for some people, but we are all just human beings: The issues matter, not the people behind the issues we are all working on. I think everyone matters.”
Marin, who started out on her political career when she was in her mid-20s, said she was spurred by climate change and a feeling “that the older generation weren’t paying enough attention” to it.
She said there is no trick to her success – just hard work.
Marin, whose Cabinet of 19 ministers will include 13 women, said she would work closely with European allies.
“We are stronger together,” she said. “Neither one of us can find the solutions alone so I think that we have a platform, we have to use it.”

417,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/icy-silence-frayed-connections-impeachment-takes-a-toll/,"WASHINGTON: The most raucous committee in Congress sat stone-faced, barely speaking.
One by one, the members around the Judiciary Committee dais voted on the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. Then they bolted for the doors and the airports, in more than one case without a word.
The all-business iciness during those eight gavel-to-gavel minutes reflected the gravity of advancing articles of impeachment to the House floor for only the third time in American history. But it also told much of the story about impeachment’s toll on Congress, Washington and beyond.
Ever since Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukraine’s president sparked official proceedings against the president, impeachment has been a force that’s bent congressional business around it, with severe strain.
No one feels sorry for Congress, and its members generally don’t feel sorry for themselves. But the wear-and-tear of impeachment is becoming clear in the emotional exchanges and frayed relationships left in its wake.
“I have a problem with this whole damn place. If you can figure out an exit strategy for me I’d appreciate that,” said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., a member of the Judiciary panel, on Friday. “This is crazy. The whole thing is crazy,” he added of impeachment. “It will take some time to get over.”
Tempers are short. Members show signs of being sick of each other, like any colleagues who spend too much time together. But they are operating under the glare of a global spotlight and the weight of history.
Trust, or what remained of it after years of obstruction and smashmouth Trump-era politics, appeared to be a casualty in the short-term.
Thursday’s grueling 14-hour Judiciary Committee markup of the abuse and obstruction charges against Trump ignited the smoldering tension. There was no expectation that the articles would be substantially changed, but Trump’s allies pushed for amendments, each of which took hours to consider. Democrats, meanwhile, did not want to take final votes too late for Americans to see.
Just before midnight, Chairman Jerrold Nadler announced that the committee would not be voting on the impeachment articles until Friday morning — and after he banged his gavel, the microphones were switched off. Livid, Republicans leapt to their feet, yelling “unbelievable” and “sneaky” and talking of a “kangaroo court.” Nadler walked out.
“Chairman Nadler’s integrity is zero. His staff is zero,” fumed ranking Republican Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia. “This chairman has made himself irrelevant.”
The personal stab at the powerful New York House veteran was unusual, as even the most mismatched pairs atop committees typically refrain from attacking each other in personal terms.
“I could feel it myself and I know the rest of us did,” said Rep. Madeleine Dean, a new member from Pennsylvania, in an interview Friday with The Associated Press. “That really was sort of the apex of weeks and months of emotional and mental and intellectual toll.”
It turns out that impeachment is not the Democratic morale-booster that some might have thought in the heady first days of the party’s House takeover this year, when Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib vowed to “impeach the motherf—-er” on her first day in office.
One Democrat involved in the impeachment investigation was so dispirited by it all that he decided this term will be his last.
“The countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary,” said Rep. Denny Heck, D-Wash., in his retirement announcement Dec. 4. “At times, it is as though there are no rules or boundaries. … Civility is out. Compromise is out. All or nothing is in.”
There’s a long way to go before knowing which party benefits and which pays for impeachment in the 2020 elections, let alone which fares better in the eyes of history. But trust — by Americans toward Congress — seems to be suffering. And it’s not clear the proceedings are changing minds. Recent polling shows that about half the country supports impeaching and removing Trump from office, fitting the pattern of a deeply polarized nation.
But the proceedings could be costly for both parties.
A plurality of Americans — 44 percent — said they had no trust at all in the House impeachment proceedings, according to a Monmouth University poll conducted in December.
The poll also found that about 6 in 10 Americans said Democrats in Congress are more interested in bringing down Trump than pursuing the facts. Likewise, about 6 in 10 said Republicans in Congress are more interested in defending Trump than pursuing the facts.
With the stakes so high, emotions are, too.
Dean, whose family has grown by two grandchildren since impeachment began in September, grew emotional Friday when she talked about the responsibility of weighing the president’s fate.
“I’ve been thinking about the broader horizon,” she said. The same week of Trump’s July phone call, she happened to talk on the floor of the House with Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the Oversight Committee Chairman who died in October.
Cummings, she said, reminded her that people will know she was here for what’s expected to be the third presidential impeachment in American history. “It will matter,” she said.
But it will not have come for free.
By the time Nadler gaveled the committee back into session Friday morning, the silences and swift proceedings suggested there was nothing left to say, let alone fight about.
Nadler sat down, pulled out his cellphone and turned it off. He gaveled in the meeting and launched votes on both articles. During the roll call, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., voted aye while holding up a pocket-sized copy of the Constitution. Collins delivered a scripted notice that he reserves the right to file dissenting views.
Nadler dropped the gavel. There was no celebrating or showboating from the Democrats.
“The House will act expeditiously,” he said. “Thank you.”
He took no questions.

418,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/iraqs-top-shiite-cleric-condemns-protester-killings-and-calls-for-gun-controls/,"BAGHDAD: Iraq’s top Shi’ite Muslim cleric on Friday condemned recent killings of anti-government protesters and urged full state control over the use of weapons in the country following one particularly deadly attack by masked gunmen in Baghdad.
Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani rarely weighs in on politics except in times of crisis but holds massive influence over public opinion in Shi’ite majority Iraq. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi pledged to quit last month hours after Sistani withdrew his support for the government.
Iraqi security forces have shot dead scores of demonstrators protesting against the government’s failure to satisfy their demands for an overhaul of the country’s political system, halting corruption and an end of deep-rooted Iranian influence over state institutions.
Sistani has addressed the unrest in every Friday sermon since the protests began on October 1, calling on security forces to deal peacefully with demonstrators and also urging protesters to shun violence.
This week’s comments followed an attack by heavily armed, masked gunmen who killed more than 20 people at Baghdad’s main protest site. They roamed the streets for hours afterwards, threatening further violence.
“We strongly condemn the killings, kidnappings and assaults that took place in all forms,” he said in a Friday sermon in the holy city of Kerbala, read out by his representative.
“We call on all concerned parties to take responsibility,” added Sistani, calling for an urgent investigation into the “horrific crimes”.
Sistani said that all weapons should be brought “under the control of the state”.
Paramilitary groups, including many backed by regional Shi’ite power Iran, make up a formal branch of Iraq’s security forces, but some operate semi-independently. Many Iran-backed Iraqi militias have ties to powerful figures in Iraq’s parliament and government.
Sistani on Friday, the cleric warned against outside interference in Iraq, urging state security forces to be loyal to the nation.
“We must reiterate the necessity to build the army, and Iraq’s other armed forces, on solid professional foundations, so that they are loyal to the homeland and can defend against external aggression,” he said.
Sistani has long opposed foreign interference, as well as the Iranian model of senior clergy being closely involved in running state institutions.
Tens of thousands of protesters have been demanding an end to Iraq’s post-2003 political system, underpinned by endemic political corruption. More than 440 people, mostly unarmed protesters but also some members of the security forces, have been killed since October 1, according to a Reuters tally.
Protesters blame Iran-backed militia groups for a spate of other killings including assassinations. Many activists have been arrested or have disappeared, local rights groups say.
Paramilitary groups have denied any role in attacking protests. Government security forces also deny using live ammunition against peaceful protesters.
As demonstrations enter their third month, violence is spiralling with an increase in threats, kidnappings and killings of activists and protesters, according to activists and security sources.
On Thursday, a young man was lynched in central Baghdad as dozens of onlookers recorded the incident on their phones, local media and rights activists reported. Reuters has been unable to verify the circumstances surrounding the incident, which was widely circulated on social media.
Iraq’s independent human rights commission blamed unidentified gangs and a lack of intervention by security forces.

QUETTA: A minibus packed passengers collided with a pickup truck carrying gasoline in southwestern Pakistan on Friday, killing at least 13 people.
According to police, the pickup truck was carrying fuel smuggled from neighboring Iran in plastic containers. The minibus caught fire in the collision, which took place in Kan Mehtarzai, a town about 75 kilometers (50 miles) north of Quetta, the capital of impoverished Baluchistan province.
It was unclear what caused the accident; police were investigating.
Road accidents are common in Pakistan where traffic laws are poorly enforced.
The country’s southwestern Baluchistan province lies on a key smuggling route. It borders Iran, from where smuggling contraband fuel is common due to significant difference in fuel prices in the two countries. In January, 27 people were killed in Baluchistan in a collision between a bus and an oil tanker.

421,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/another-opioid-crisis-is-raging-through-the-developing-world/,"KAPURTHALA: Reports rolled in with escalating urgency — pills seized by the truckload, pills swallowed by schoolchildren, pills in the pockets of dead terrorists.
These pills, the world has been told, are safer than the OxyContins, the Vicodins, the fentanyl that have wreaked so much devastation. But now they are the root of what the United Nations named “the other opioid crisis” — an epidemic featured in fewer headlines than the American one, as it rages through the planet’s most vulnerable countries.
Mass abuse of the opioid tramadol spans continents, from India to Africa to the Middle East, creating international havoc some experts blame on a loophole in narcotics regulation and a miscalculation of the drug’s danger. The man-made opioid was touted as a way to relieve pain with little risk of abuse. Unlike other opioids, tramadol flowed freely around the world, unburdened by international controls that track most dangerous drugs.
But abuse is now so rampant that some countries are asking international authorities to intervene.
Grunenthal, the German company that originally made the drug, is campaigning for the status quo, arguing that it’s largely illicit counterfeit pills causing problems. International regulations make narcotics difficult to get in countries with disorganised health systems, the company says, and adding tramadol to the list would deprive suffering patients access to any opioid at all.
“This is a huge public health dilemma,” said Dr Gilles Forte, the secretary of the World Health Organisation’s committee that recommends how drugs should be regulated. Tramadol is available in war zones and impoverished nations because it is unregulated. But it is widely abused for the same exact reason. “It’s a really very complicated balance to strike.”
Tramadol has not been as deadly as other opioids, and the crisis isn’t killing with the ferocity of America’s struggle with the drugs. Still, individual governments from the US to Egypt to Ukraine have realised the drug’s dangers are greater than was believed and have worked to rein in the tramadol trade. The north Indian state of Punjab, the center of India’s opioid epidemic, was the latest to crack down. The pills were everywhere, as legitimate medication sold in pharmacies, but also illicit counterfeits hawked by street vendors.
This year, authorities seized hundreds of thousands of tablets, banned most pharmacy sales and shut down pill factories, pushing the price from 35 cents for a 10-pack to $14. The government opened a network of treatment centers, fearing those who had become opioid addicted would resort to heroin out of desperation. Hordes of people rushed in, seeking help in managing excruciating withdrawal.
For some, tramadol had become as essential as food.
“Like if you don’t eat, you start to feel hungry. Similar is the case with not taking it,” said auto shop welder Deepak Arora, a gaunt 30-year-old who took 15 tablets day, so much he had to steal from his family to pay for pills. “You are like a dead person.”
Jeffery Bawa, an officer with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, realised what was happening in 2016, when he travelled to Mali in western Africa, one of the world’s poorest countries, gripped by civil war and terrorism. They asked people for their most pressing concerns. Most did not say hunger or violence. They said tramadol.
One woman said children stumble down the streets, high on the opioid; parents add it to tea to dull the ache of hunger. Nigerian officials said at a United Nations meeting on tramadol trafficking that the number of people there living with addiction is now far higher than the number with AIDS or HIV.
Tramadol is so pervasive in Cameroon scientists a few years ago believed they’d discovered a natural version in tree roots. But it was not natural at all: Farmers bought pills and fed them to their cattle to ward off the effects of debilitating heat. Their waste contaminated the soil, and the chemical seeped into the trees.
Police began finding pills on terrorists, who traffic it to fund their networks and take it to bolster their capacity for violence, Bawa said.
Most of it was coming from India. The country’s sprawling pharmaceutical industry is fueled by cheap generics. Pill factories produce knock-offs and ship them in bulk around the world, in doses far exceeding medical limits.
In 2017, law enforcement reported that $75 million worth of tramadol from India was confiscated en route to the Islamic State terror group. Authorities intercepted 600,000 tablets headed for Boko Haram. Another 3 million were found in a pickup truck in Niger, in boxes disguised with UN logos. The agency warned that tramadol was playing “a direct role in the destabilisation of the region.”
“We cannot let the situation get any further out of control,” that alert read.
Grunenthal maintains that tramadol has a low risk of abuse; most of the pills causing trouble are knock-offs, not legitimate pharmaceuticals, and American surveys have shown lower levels of abuse than other prescription painkillers. The company submitted a report to the WHO in 2014, saying that the abuse evident in “a limited number of countries,” should be viewed “in the context of the political and social instabilities in the region.”
But some wealthy countries worried about increasing abuse also have acted to contain the drug.
The United Kingdom and United States both regulated it in 2014. Tramadol was uncontrolled in Denmark until 2017, when journalists asked doctors to review studies submitted to regulators to support the claim that it has a low risk for addiction, said Dr Karsten Juhl Jorgensen, acting director of the Nordic Cochrane Centre and one of the physicians who analysed the materials. They all agreed that the documents did not prove it’s safer.
“We know that opioids are some of the most addictive drugs on the face of the planet, so the claim that you’ve developed one that’s not addictive, that’s an extraordinary claim, and extraordinary claims require evidence. And it just wasn’t there,” said Jorgensen. “We’ve all been cheated, and people are angry about that.”
Jorgensen compares claims that tramadol is low risk to those made by American companies now facing thousands of lawsuits alleging misleading campaigns touting the safety of opioids unleashed the US addiction epidemic.
Stefano Berterame, a chief at the International Narcotics Control Board, said there is a critical difference: The crisis is not as deadly as the American one, which began with prescription opioids and transitioned to heroin and fentanyl. Tramadol does not as routinely cause the respiratory depression that leads to overdose death.
But it is mostly afflicting poor nations, where overdose statistics are erratic, he said, so the true toll of tramadol is unknown.
The United Nations established the International Narcotics Control Board in 1961 to spare the world the “serious evil” of addiction. It has since tracked most opioids.
Tramadol’s exemption means authorisation isn’t required as the drug moves across borders. Its easy availability also leads to confusion about what tramadol even is, experts say. In many countries, it is thought to be a mood enhancer or treatment for depression and post-traumatic stress. Some take it to improve sexual stamina or endure gruelling labour.
Grunenthal synthesised tramadol in the 1960s, as the company was embroiled in a scandal over its marketing of the sedative thalidomide, which caused extreme birth defects in thousands of babies whose mothers took it. Tramadol was initially believed to have a low risk of abuse because initial trials studied injected tramadol, the most potent route for most opioids. But researchers later found that tramadol releases a far more powerful dose taken orally because of how it is metabolised by the liver.
Tramadol’s worldwide market quickly expanded in the 1990s. In 2000, the WHO, which assesses medications and recommends scheduling, noted reports of dependence. A committee has reviewed the drug numerous times since, recommended it remain under surveillance but declined to add international regulation.
There is no alternative to tramadol, said Forte, the committee’s secretary. It is the only opioid available in some of the world’s most desperate places; relief organisations rely on it in war zones and natural disasters. It is used extensively not because it is a particularly good medication, he said. The most effective opioid is morphine, but morphine is strictly controlled and countries in crisis fear abuse. Tramadol became the default precisely because it’s uncontrolled.
The WHO is analysing whether any other drug could take its place but have so far found none. Meanwhile, Forte said, the agency is working with battered nations to ferret out counterfeits.
Legitimate tramadol remains a lucrative business: market research estimates the global market amounts to around $1.4 billion, according to Grunenthal. The medication long ago lost its patent protection. It is now manufactured by many companies and sold under some 500 brand names. Grunenthal markets it as Tramal as well as Zaldiar, tramadol combined with paracetamol. In 2018, those products brought in 174 million euros ($191 million), according to the company’s annual report.
“Our purpose at Grunenthal is to develop and deliver medicines and solutions which address the unmet needs of patients with the goal of improving their quality of life,” the company wrote in a statement that said it acknowledges opioids pose a risk of abuse and addiction. “We do so with the highest ethical standards.”
Grunenthal also sells other opioids and is expanding around the world. The Associated Press this year revealed executives were swept up in an Italian corruption case alleging they illegally paid a doctor to promote the use of opioids.
The company has campaigned to keep tramadol unregulated. It funded surveys that found regulation would impede pain treatment and paid consultants to travel to the WHO to make their case that it’s safer that other opioids.
Spokesman Stepan Kracala said regulation would not necessarily curtail illicit trade and could backfire: Some desperate pain patients turn to the black market if no legal options exist. Egypt’s long struggle with tramadol abuse is an example, he said. The country enacted strict regulation in 2012 and a later survey found some suffering from cancer using counterfeit tramadol for relief.
Kracala also pointed to regulatory decisions as proof of tramadol’s comparable safety: The US in 2014 added tramadol to its list of controlled substances but included it in a lesser category than opioids like oxycodone or morphine, signaling it is less risky.
There are growing calls to change that.
The Mayo Clinic hospital in Minnesota worked to reduce opioids prescribed post-surgery as the American epidemic escalated, said surgeon Cornelius Thiels. Doctors there started shifting patients to tramadol because it was billed as safer. But Thiels and his colleagues analysed prescription data and were surprised to find patients prescribed tramadol were just as likely to move on to long-term use.
They published their findings this year to alert authorities, he said: “There is no safe opioid. Tramadol is not a safe alternative. It’s a mistake that we didn’t figure it out sooner. It’s unfortunate that it took us this long. There’s a lot more that we need to learn about it, but I think we know enough that we also can’t wait around to act on this.”
Indian regulators knew the massive quantities manufactured in the country were spilling over domestically and countless Indians were addicted. But SK Jha, responsible for the northern region of India’s Narcotics Control Bureau, said he was shocked to learn in 2018 that tramadol from India was ravaging African nations. They realised then they needed to act, he said.
India regulated tramadol in April 2018. Regulators say exports overseas and abuse at home came down. But they acknowledge that the vastness of the pharmaceutical industry and the ingenuity of traffickers makes curtailing abuse and illegal exports all but impossible. Tramadol is still easy to find.
Jyoti Rani stood on her front steps and pointed to house after house where she said tramadol is still sold in her neighborhood of narrow roads and open drains, where school-aged boys sit hunched over the street in the middle of a weekday.
Rani’s addiction began with heroin. When her 14-year-old son died, she fell into depression.
“I wanted to kill myself, but I ended up becoming an addict,” she cried. A doctor prescribed tramadol to help kick the habit — instead, she formed a new one. She locked herself in her room, not eating or taking care of her two children. Rani used tramadol until she ran out of money and entered treatment. Now her family tells her she’s her old self again.
The crackdown on tramadol coincided with the opening of dozens of addiction clinics that administer medicine and counseling to more than 30,000 each day.
“We are trying our level best,” Jha said, “but it’s a challenge for all of us.”
Countries’ efforts to control tramadol on their own often fail, particularly in places where addiction has taken hold, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
India has twice the global average of illicit opiate consumption. Researchers estimate 4 million Indians use heroin or other opioids, and a quarter of them live in the Punjab, India’s agricultural heartland bordering Pakistan, where some of the most vulnerable are driven to drugs out of desperation.
Amandeep Kaur was pregnant when her husband died of a heart attack. She turned to the sex trade to make ends meet. She wanted not to feel, and a fellow sex worker suggested tramadol. She had no idea she’d get addicted, but eventually needed three pills to get through the day.
“If I didn’t have it I felt lifeless, my body ached as if I was going to die,” she said, and joined the line stretching from the addiction clinic’s doors.

422,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/eu-leaders-break-stalemate-over-climate-target-claim-deal/,"BRUSSELS: EU leaders broke a deadlock early Friday and claimed a deal over a key climate target by committing to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, sidestepping the objections of Poland, one of the blocs biggest economies.
Two days after the EU’s new commission chief unveiled her “European Green Deal” to fight climate change, heads of state and government cried victory during a summit in Brussels, calling it a major step forward in the continent’s ambition to remain a global climate leader.
“We reached an agreement on climate change. It is crucial,” EU Council President Charles Michel said.
Poland failed to commit to the deal but couldn’t stop the summit meeting from endorsing “the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050,” as the conclusions read. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Poland’s hesitation, considering its dependency on coal, was “completely acceptable.” She said it was “an intensive vivid debate” that preceded the decision after some 10 hours of talks.
Poland had wanted to wait until 2070 to go climate neutral instead of 2050, according to a European diplomat involved in the talks, but the other EU leaders refused. Von der Leyen said Poland could have more time to “go through details, but this will not change the time frame.”
Prime Minister Mateusz Morowiecki insisted that “Poland has been exempted from the principle of reaching climate neutrality (by 2050). We will reach it at our own pace.”

Michel said it would take a special meeting with Poland to overcome the objections, set for next June. “It’s important to take into consideration different national circumstances and different starting points; to take into consideration the social consequences” of the transition to clean energy, Michel said.
The EU leader was criticised for claiming a deal while Poland still stood aside, but Michel said that “we need to be creative to advance the European project.”
Making the bloc’s economy carbon neutral by 2050 has been a hot topic on the European agenda for months, but the proposal failed to get approval at a summit last June and was relegated to a non-binding footnote in the final statement of that summit.
Von der Leyen has since been appointed as the new chief of the EU Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, and has made the fight against climate change her top priority. Another failure this week to get support from all members would be seen as an ill-fated start for her five-year tenure.
A major problem for coal-dependent nations Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is the heavy costs associated with transforming their economy and energy sources. To get the support of all EU members, von der Leyen on Wednesday unveiled a new “European Green Deal,” with an offer of some 100 billion euros ($130 billion) in public and private funds to help the fossil-fuel reliant EU nations make the transition to lower emissions.
In addition to the cash issue, leaders also must find a compromise on the type of energies that will be used during the transition.
The Czechs want guarantees that they won’t be prevented from developing nuclear power units and will have the support of France, whose electricity production is largely provided by nuclear sources.
“Nuclear is part of the transition,” French President Emmanuel Macron said. “The all-coal countries won’t be able to switch to all-renewable overnight.”
Before reaching carbon neutrality, Von der Leyen wants the bloc to reduce carbon emission by at least 50% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, more than the current goal of 40%. If possible, she would like to increase the EU’s target for 2030 to as high as 55% without hurting the bloc’s economy.
Climate policy experts have urged the EU to quickly implement tougher emissions targets for 2030. Frans Timmermans, the commissioner in charge of the Green Deal, said he hoped the proposal for the EU’s 2030 emissions reduction targets would be ready in June.
Greenpeace activists, who have described Von der Leyen’s plans as “too little too late,” staged a protest before the meeting started. They scaled the European Union’s new headquarters and unfurled a banner warning of a “climate emergency.”
The banner stood for several hours but was removed before leaders arrived. Activists were also dispersed.
“The world is on fire and our governments are letting it burn,” Greenpeace Europe Director Jorgo Riss told the AP.

BERLIN: At least 25 people were injured in an explosion in an apartment block in the eastern German city of Blankenburg on Friday, police said, adding that the cause of the blast was not yet known.
Residents were being evacuated from the block where the explosion had occurred, spokesman Uwe Becker said.
A photo tweeted by police showed a five-storey communist-era residential block with smoke rising from blackened windows on the second floor.

424,https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/twitter-brings-back-election-labels-for-2020-us-candidates/,"SAN FRANCISCO: Twitter is bringing back special labels to help users identify accounts and tweets from US political candidates.
The company, which  first used such labels for the midterm elections last year, said it is trying to provide users with original sources of information and prevent spoofed and fake accounts from fooling voters.
Many political candidates already have blue check marks to indicate that Twitter has confirmed that they are who they say they are.
The election labels go further and provide details such as what office a person is running for and where. They will also carry a small ballot box icon. The labels will appear on candidates’ accounts and tweets, even if they are retweeted by someone else.
Twitter hopes its efforts will help people know when candidates are behind the words attributed to them. This could prevent someone from creating an account pretending to be a politician, for instance, or attributing a tweet to a candidate who didn’t actually make the tweet.

Twitter, along with Facebook and other social media companies, has been under heavy scrutiny for allowing their services to be misused by malicious individuals and groups trying to influence elections around the world.
Facebook also verifies accounts for public figures and celebrities, while YouTube verifies official channels. But they don’t go as far as adding election labels.
Labels will be used only for general election candidates and will start appearing once candidates have won their parties’ primaries or have otherwise qualified for the general election ballot.
Twitter said it will apply the labels in House, Senate and gubernatorial races. Presidential candidates are not included in Twitter’s new policies. The 2020 presidential candidates are already all verified and Twitter says if more join the race, they will get verified too. The company says it won’t apply election labels to presidential candidates but may do so down the road.
Major presidential candidates already have blue check marks to indicate that Twitter has confirmed the accounts are legitimate. Many candidates for House, Senate and gubernatorial races have them as well.
Twitter said Thursday it will verify additional accounts, even if candidates do not seek them, by working with the nonprofit, nonpartisan Ballotpedia. Twitter said the verifications will happen on a rolling basis as candidates qualify for next year’s primaries.

LONDON: The pioneers behind the world’s first fully electric, commercial flight say they have made history, but climate-change activists see electric air travel as a dream yet to come true.
The Harbour Air seaplane – which seats six – took off close to Vancouver in Canada on Tuesday and flew for less than 15 minutes. Its pilot, Greg McDougall, declared the mission a success, saying in a statement: “We made history.”

It was the first time an all-electric commercial plane had taken to the skies, unleashing hopes that fuel-guzzling jets – a key cause of global warming – could be replaced by a green alternative.
Climate-change activists welcomed the maiden flight but played down hopes that electric planes carrying mass tourists, commuters or business travellers would take off any time soon.
“We’re still a long way from having a commercial service,” said Lucy Gilliam, aviation and shipping campaigner at Transport & Environment, a European umbrella group of NGOs campaigning for cleaner transportation.
“This is a milestone, but we need to be realistic that electrification will play a role in short-haul flights, but not in the long-haul,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Brussels.
The record test flight – albeit short – came as eco-friendly travellers try to reduce their carbon footprint and use “flight shaming” to persuade others to follow suit.
Teenaged climate activist Greta Thunberg – named on Wednesday as Time magazine’s person of the year – took the lead in August when she used a racing yacht to get to the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.
REVOLUTION
Aviation experts say electrification has the potential for revolution, promising safer, quieter flights and cheap tickets.
But long-distance electric flying – which cuts maintenance costs and has zero emissions – is still decades way, they said.
“This is paving the way for private jets to be electrified,” said Leo Murray of Britain’s Possible charity, which campaigns for climate action.
But he said long-distance journeys in large airplanes “make up the bulk of the climate damage from air travel”.
Others agreed there was lots more work to be done.
“If we are considering electrification of aircraft as a potential solution to aviation’s impact on climate change, then this is only the start,” Nikhil Sachdeva, from consulting firm Roland Berger, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
The lithium battery used in the Canadian flight could only power a seaplane for about 160 km, almost the distance by plane from Brussels to Luxembourg.
Harbour Air plans to start electrifying its fleet of more than 40 seaplanes by 2022, once certification and regulation processes are completed.
“We don’t have perfect science and perfect data on exactly how (the electric aircrafts) will perform. So the regulators need time to gather that data and to learn from the technologies before they can say this is safe”, said Sachdeva.
