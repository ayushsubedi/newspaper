On new year’s day, President Bidya Devi Bhandari inaugurated Visit Nepal Year 2020, aimed at attracting 2 million tourists this year, at a lavish show in Kathmandu’s main stadium with fireworks and a flypast of military helicopters. There was only one thing wrong with the event: it was in Kathmandu and not in the countries from which it is trying to attract visitors. The money would have been better spent on targeted promotion in selected countries.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Read also: Long road back to Shangrila, Mukesh Pokhrel It might have been an even better idea to spend the money sprucing up Kathmandu airport, fixing the roads, and cleaning up a once-beautiful Valley that has become an ulcer — before bothering to convince visitors to come. All seven provinces inaugurated the campaign with much fanfare. The parades were performed by Nepalis and the spectators were Nepalis. How does that help bring more tourists to Nepal?  Well-intentioned it may be, but the entire Visit Nepal campaign has been mediocre and sloppy every step of the way — planned and executed by people without imagination or knowledge about the tourism industry. Read also: Chinese tourist influx to Nepal in 2020, Josie Wang Make sure visit Nepal in 2020, Anil Chitrakar The travel industry is generally unenthusiastic, and it is understandable why: There has been insufficient preparation in the countries we should have prioritised for promotionPublicity and marketing should have started at least two years ago, not on January 1.The Ministry of Tourism has shown utter fecklessness by asking ambassadors to send senior ministers for the 1 January event in Kathmandu. (Why would anyone spoil a new year’s holiday and travel all the way at such short notice?)Minister of Tourism Yogesh Bhattarai travelled to Australia to launch the campaign in the middle of a national fire emergency. Bhattarai then announced that Nepali workers travelling abroad would mandatorily have to wear Visit Nepal caps and t-shirts. Everyone ignored this edict.Nepal Tourism Board lost its chief at the start of VNY 2020.There should be a revenue target, not a target of 2 million visitors. The only aerial gateway to Nepal is a disgrace. It seems purpose-built for maximum inconvenience, with an incomprehensible visa-on-arrival process and an excruciating queue at the ‘metal free’ x-ray.Nepal sells itself for cheap, but it is an expensive destination to get to mainly because of the high cost of aviation fuel which airlines are compelled to pass on to passengers.The miracle is that despite everything we do to dissuade them, visitors still come to Nepal. The country has such high brand equity that even though we have done everything to wreck it with all the squalour and decrepitude in Kathmandu and our Byzantine bureaucracy, tourists still come.  We have even destroyed the countryside with haphazard road-construction along popular trekking routes —  treacherous passages that even the bravest fear to tread. Read also: Pokhara: Nepal’s new aviation gateway, Kunda Dixit      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Instead of promoting Nepal within Nepal, the government should mark Visit Nepal 2020 by cleaning up Nepal in 2020. The trekking trails need to be preserved and cleared of plastic garbage, it has to be convenient and safe to get to the hinterland, and visitors should be encouraged to spend their money where it is needed the most — in the villages through which they hike. There is the idea that only Kathmandu, Pokhara, Lumbini and Chitwan are Nepal’s tourist attractions. There is  fundamental ignorance among policymakers about what a tourist is looking for in Nepal — they do not come here to be extorted every step of the way with two-tier pricing for tickets for museums to domestic airlines.  In the past, the Maoist insurgency, a decade of political instability with frequent shutdowns (hotel vans still carry ‘Tourist Only’ on windshields as a relic from that era), the earthquake and the Blockade could have been blamed for low visitor numbers. We have no more excuses. Nepal now is a vibrant democracy with a strong government.  Publicity within the country for Visit Nepal 2020 must be channeled to making people aware about cleanliness, maintaining infrastructure, reducing bureaucratic red tape, and streamlining procedures to make visitors’ stay as convenient as possible by treating them really as gods, not as wallets. Only then will tourism once again be a strong pillar of the economy. The industry that once contributed 22% to the national GDP now contributes only 4%. Tourism income can help Nepal redress it growing trade gap. Nepal’s location is ideal for tourism. We need to expand the country’s national airline, spread its network and rebuild the Nepal brand.

The Nepali Times edition of #484 from 8-14 January 2010 ten years ago was full of revelation of a fallout between Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Baburam Bhattarai. Even the Ass made fun of it. But this paragraph from Prashant Jha’s column, Plain Speaking said it all: Nepal may still have been stuck in a bloody conflict but for Dr Baburam Bhattarai and his emphasis on democratic republicanism. The ongoing attempts to marginalise him within the Maoists reveal much about the balance of power and how counterproductive it could be for the peace and constitution-writing process. By snubbing Bhattarai and his ‘line’ again – as Prachanda did by depriving him of the deputy prime ministership in August 2008 and incorporating Kiran’s views at Kharipati two months later – the Maoists run the risk of undermining their achievements, repeating the mistakes of their 20th century communist counterparts, and failing.

Nepal’s ruling unified Marxist-Leninist-Maoists have in the past year incrementally constricted freedom of expression, thinking no one will notice if they do it bit by bit. It has not gone unnoticed. There is an uproar in social media and journalists have been speaking out, but the government is using its numerical might in Parliament to pass bills that blatantly flout constitutional guarantees of basic individual freedoms.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Read also: No freedom after expression, Kiran nepal 2019 saw censorship in installments, and it started with a revision of the Penal Code that criminalised ridicule, satire, photoshopped images of politicians, and even banned reporters publishing personal information of public figures. The Media Council Bill, a brainchild of Information Minister Gokul Banskota, sought to criminalise free speech on vague grounds. The latest attack is the Information Technology Bill which was passed by a Parliament committee this week, and is sure to be voted through when the winter session begins. It has hefty fines and jail terms for any content deemed ‘offensive or demeaning’ — infringement of Clause 83 is a fine of Rs1 million and/or jail term of up to five years, and any content that violates Clause 94 (ridicule and hate speech) carries a fine of Rs1.5 million and/or 5 years in jail. Strangely, the punishment for social media infractions are in fact much heavier than physical assault, libel or defamation in the legacy media. Read also: Spooking Nepalis by snooping on them, Mukesh Pokhrel Censuring censorship, Editorial ‘It is wrong for this bill that is supposed to regulate Information Technology to be misused to address issues for which there are existing laws,’ wrote Kantipur in a strong editorial on Wednesday. ‘Since the definition of defamation is so broad, this law will have a dampening effect on free expression, and foster self-censorship.’ Indeed, what constitutes objectionable content is intentionally so broadly defined that anyone can be hauled in for any online post at any time. There is even a new directive against satire painted in the backs of trucks. The government has not even waited for this Act to be passed to arbitrarily put people behind bars for Facebook posts, YouTube satire, or beat up someone for posting a video that painted an unflattering image of the Tourism Minister. For formality’s sake, the bill was put to debate in the parliamentary committee, and the opposition Nepali Congress did push several amendments, none of which were accepted by NCP lawmakers. Now, the arithmetic of the full House means that the IT Act is sure to become law. Fundamental rights of citizens, guaranteed by the 2015 Constitution, are going to be severely curtailed. Read also: Creeping control over the press in Nepal, Ajay Pradhan Gagging the press in installments, Sewa Bhattarai “It is the government that will decide what you can say and what you cannot,” says NC MP Gagan Thapa in an online video. “Just because a government has a majority, it does not mean it can violate the basic principle of the Constitution.”      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But Thapa is a voice in the wilderness, none of the other opposition politicians have bothered to speak up in defence of freedom of expression even when the attack is so systematic. Under the new law, internet service providers will be liable for content of users, and global platforms like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok would be required to register in Nepal. Other provisions of the IT bill would allow the state to snoop on anyone’s data, tap phones and intercept emails. Politicians want their privacy protected from media, but do not respect the individual’s right to privacy.   The ruling NCP seems to have decided that it can pressure the press by withholding advertising, making media moguls beholden to it for business, and tightening regulation. For example, the NCP-affiliated Press Organisation surprised many by being inaugurated this week at the prime minister’s residence, where journalists took oaths to follow the party line on socialism. At least they did not swear by communism.  Read also:  Zip up, Rameshwar Bohora A creeping coup, Editorial The state sees the free-wheeling nature of the Internet and its impact on public opinion as more of a threat. Hence the attempt to restrict critical content on social media as its reach grows. More than 90% of Nepalis now have mobile phones, half of them are smart phones, and this proportion is growing. The Internet has become synonymous with Facebook as almost everyone with a smartphone has an account on that platform.    Why is Nepal’s kakistocracy in such a tearing hurry to pass this bill when much more urgent legislation on federalism and other laws languish in Parliament? Journalists and citizens may not be arrested right away, but clearly the intention is detention. This is not rule of law, but a draconian rule by law. 















































10 years ago this week 





















Ten years ago Nepali Times marked the end of a year and a decade of war, and tried to be hopeful about the future. As feared, the 2010-2019 was a lost decade. Excerpt from a publisher’s note on the front page of issue #483 of 1-6 January 2010: Back in 2000, we had no idea just how dramatic the decade ahead was going to be. The first (nearly) 500 issues of this newspaper coincided with a period of great transformation. Guerrillas went from the bullet to the ballot and emerged as the single largest party, and the most inclusive assembly in our country’s history was elected. Nepal became a model for non-violent political change: a case study that proved revolutions don’t necessarily have to be bloody. Imagine how much more progress we would have made if there had been a stable political climate and a more accountable government committed to basic needs. Let’s hope that in the next decade we will live in less interesting times.

Legend has it that the real reason Nepal stayed an independent nation state while all around us were colonised was that our powerful neighbours took one look at the terrain and people here and concluded that the country was ungovernable. In the three decades after 1990, Nepal’s elected leaders have shown even fewer smarts than past feudal dynasties. The biggest let-down has been in the last two years, after the unified Nepal Communist Party swept the country’s first three-tier federal elections. The strongest government in Nepal’s democratic history is showing itself to be more feckless than those fragile do-nothing coalitions.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Perhaps the latest example of shooting ourselves in the feet has been the wrangling within the NCP over the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). If there was one vivid example of how not to look a gift horse in the mouth, this is it.  The awkwardly-named MCC was launched by President George W Bush in 2004 after the 9/11 attacks to reorient American aid towards the kind of infrastructure projects that USAID or the World Bank would not touch. At first, with an ongoing war Nepal was deemed ineligible for the MCC.  But by 2012, with progress in health and education and economic, political and press freedom, as well as prospects for the rule of law, Nepal qualified for membership. A threshold program in Kathmandu went about shortlisting investments in infrastructure that could jumpstart development.  Nepali planners, working with their American counterparts, singled out transmission lines and highways as main economic bottlenecks. But they worried that Nepal did not have a governance track record, transparency or policy continuity to guarantee that the MCC’s $500 million could be effectively spent in five years.  Finally in 2017, the Nepal government committed $130 million as counterpart funds, and the Hetauda-Damauli-Butwal 400kVA transmission line, as well as rehabilitation of 305km of highways from Itahari-Kakarvitta and Pokhara-Butwal, were selected for the MCC. These were not chosen arbitrarily — serious homework was done to find catalytic projects that could transform economic growth through quick returns on investment. This was a departure from the way planning is normally done in Nepal: ad hoc, whimsical, wasteful. The MCC also made provisions to ensure transparency and minimise the kind of delays in large infrastructure projects that Nepal has become notorious for.  Any other government worth its salt, and one that knows what is good for its people, would have jumped at a deal like this. But not Nepal under the NCP. Members of the party’s central committee have objected that the MCC is part of the US Indo-Pacific Strategy, objecting to a clause that would require Indian go-ahead on the transmission line, and at provisions for independent outside auditing. It is true that there is rarely a free lunch in official development assistance — even a grant is somehow tied to the strategic interest of the donor. But the MCC predates both China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Indo-Pacific Strategy. Yes, there is a new cold war between Beijing and Washington, the two compete globally for political, economic and military domination, and both superpowers have strategic concerns in Nepal.  But it would be in Nepal’s own strategic interest to take maximum advantage and get both the BRI and the MCC to contribute to Nepal’s infrastructure development. Instead, some sections of the NCP are doing their best to wreck both initiatives so Nepal is left with neither.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The reason the MCC needs to be cleared with Delhi is because Nepal’s planners decided to upgrade the transmission line to 400kVA so it can also export electricity to India through Gorakhpur. And having Parliament ratify the compact would ensure political continuity and commitment. Last week in this newspaper we projected an optimistic scenario of what Nepal may look like by 2030. Infrastructure-led development is necessary because jobs will be created during construction, and improved connectivity will have downstream benefits into the future. However, there are good, bad and ugly infrastructure projects. The ‘excavator roads’ that maul our mountains are not just ugly, they are an environmental disaster.  Pokhara’s new international airport is too costly for its capacity, but at least it is being built and may help diversify tourism while decongesting Kathmandu. The proposed airport in Nijgad is an example of ill-advised megalomania. In fact, it is not an airport project but a timber concession. Yes, it is a game changer but only in the sense that it will wreck both our economy and environment.  Decisions on large, expensive projects must be taken by technocrats and planners who know what they are doing, not by ignorant, populist politicians with edifice complexes who want to commit colossal blunders like Nijgad and sabotage a worthy initiative like the MCC. 















































10 years ago this week 





















Go back 10 years to read Nepali Times #482, 25-31 December 2009, and its front page news roundup titled ‘End on a high’. It shows us that the more things change in Nepal, the more they remain the same. An excerpt: ‘A rollercoaster week of recriminations and reconciliations began with a three-day Maoist bandh marked by violence and intimidation across the country. It peaked with a massive Maoist assembly in New Baneswor. Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal then delivered a fiery anti-Indian tirade during which he labelled the rest of the political leadership ‘remote-controlled robots,’ who he would bypass to hold direct talks with Delhi. Amidst widespread condemnation, the Maoist supremo weakly argued the following day that his comments were meant to be a ‘satire’ on the shape of things in Nepali politics.’

The most spectacular failure, and one that affects every sector of the state, has been in governance. Despite two elections, a new constitution and three tiers of elections under federalism, after which the ruling party commands a two-thirds majority, Nepal is still drifting aimlessly, without a coherent strategy for the future.

Read also:  Nepal in 2030, Sanghamitra Subba A future written in the stars, Sanghamitra Subba      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The past two years since elections have been the most disappointing. After surviving the triple whammy of an earthquake, Blockade and the tyranny of a corrupt anti-corruption czar in 2015-2016, the unified left swept the election. There was finally hope that a strong popular mandate would usher in an era of stability. Elections to local governments after nearly 20 years were supposed to ensure accountability from the grassroots up. Sadly, the same old faces are still in the saddle, making the same old mistakes, and politics is as centralised as ever. Corrupt contractors with political protection go scot free despite failing to complete roads, bridges, airports or irrigation projects. A government that cannot complete a 5km section of road in the capital in five years has no right to go about pushing a new $6-billion airport. Bureaucrats delayed the Melamchi project, the upgrade of the Kathmandu airport and many other projects by scaring away investors with open extortion. All of Nepal’s woes stem from lack of transparency and failure of governance at every level. The only way to clean it up will be the next federal and local elections in 2022. By that time we need electoral reform, introduce absentee bablloting, end impunity and force failed fogeys into retirement.

Nepal is the only low-income country with low growth that has halved its poverty rate in the past 10 years. Despite natural and manmade disasters, the country took rapid strides in human development. However, poor governance and economic policy have stalled progress, increased inequality, widened the trade deficit and forced more Nepalis to migrate overseas. Remittances helped reduce poverty, but they have not raised investment and farm productivity, or improved service delivery. In the coming 2020-2030 decade, Nepal must get out of the low-growth and high-migration trap.

There used to be a time when the main public health threat in Nepal was from infectious diseases like malaria, encephalitis, TB and typhoid. Whether vector-borne or transmitted through contaminated air or water, the most cost-effective way to address them was through prevention. Communication was the first line of defence against communicable diseases. Things have changed. Awareness has grown because literacy rates are up. Most Nepalis now suffer from non-communicable ailments like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal failure and malignancies. These need treatment in medical facilities at a time when the over-commercialisation of hospitals has made healthcare unaffordable for a majority of the population. In fact, poor health is making Nepalis poorer. Read also: Is free health care possible in Nepal?, S P Kalaunee      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Federalism leaves Nepal’s medical sector ailing, Sewa Bhattarai Also, communicable diseases have not been completely overcome. Diarrhoeal dehydration and other water-carried infections are still major killers. One of the reasons Nepal’s progress in reducing child mortality has stalled is because of the state’s failure to ensure adequate and safe drinking water in remote regions. In this paper we have also reported on stunting and wasting among children due to malnutrition. In addition, worsening air pollution has caused an epidemic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which has led to lung infections in all age brackets and causing terminal pneumonia and other complications in the elderly. At current levels of PM2.5 concentration in the air, studies show, the average lifespan of city dwellers in Nepal could be reduced by up to four years. Read also: “Nepal is a microcosm of all of the change in world health” Poor health, Editorial Nepal’s burden of non-communicable diseases and injuries has doubled in the last 25 years, with nearly 15% caused by road traffic accidents or natural disasters. Traffic accidents are now the second biggest killer of young Nepalis. Just in the past three weeks, 90 people have been killed on highways due to poor road condition or carelessness. A vivid indication of the threat of non-communicable diseases is today’s prevalence of diabetes. South Asians are genetically more susceptible to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, but there are now new risk factors caused by increasing rural to urban migration. While the world prevalence average for both types of diabetes is 8%, research has shown that 14% of people in Dharan suffer from the disease. Taplejung, from where many have migrated to Dharan, has a rate of only 1%. The reason is clear: increased intake of carbohydrates and a more sedentary lifestyle when people move to cities.  To meet these challenges, Nepal desperately needs affordable and accessible medical care. At the moment, hospital treatment is neither. The poor in remote, underserved areas of the country are disproportionately vulnerable. As our report from Bajura shows, the problem is further complicated because confusion over federalism, budget and jurisdiction has left most rural government hospitals underfunded and underserved. It is imperative that the government act quickly to resolve the retention crisis caused by medical staff getting themselves transferred out of their jobs in remote areas. Read also:  A national health insurance is not as easy as it looks, Sonia Awale      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); This is how to upgrade Nepal’s rural health, Sewa Bhattarai A survey last year showed that half of all medical expenditure of Nepalis families is out-of-pocket, and 60% of that is for treatment of non-communicable diseases and injuries. The federal government allocates only about 10% of its budget to health care, and the focus is still on communicable diseases. Donor priority is also not on non-communicable diseases and injuries. A study of government hospitals by the Nick Simons Institute shows a huge unmet need in remote areas for basic surgery like caesarean sections and orthopaedics. One bright spot ahead is the success of pilot insurance schemes being tried out in various parts of the country. In a commentary this week, S P Kalaunee of Nyaya Health, an NGO that helps the government manage hospitals in Achham and Dolakha, presents a proven 60:25:15 formula of health insurance. In this arrangement, non-profits, the private sector and all three levels of government can make medical care affordable to all Nepalis, if upscaled. Under the scheme, 60% of the cost of care comes from insurance, provincial governments pay 25% and municipalities take care of the remaining 15%. Parts of the scheme are being tried out in Bayalpata Hospital in Achham (which last week won the Global Architecture Festival award in Amsterdam for its design). Insurance reimbursement covers the cost of insurance-covered care, the local government allocates funds required for basic and emergency healthcare, and the provincial government pays for managing the cost of referrals beyond insurance coverage. Internationally, this has become an issue with 12 December marked as Universal Health Coverage Day. Nepal’s constitution now guarantees basic and emergency healthcare as fundamental rights of citizens, and puts the responsibility on to the state. The government  can no longer keep passing the buck on providing universal insurance for its citizens.

In the strict legalese that the United Nations is accustomed to, the Madrid Climate Summit is called the 25th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We will call it COP25 for short. After riots engulfed Santiago in Chile, the venue was shifted to Madrid — just as well because that reduced the carbon footprint of the gathering. COP25 comes at a time when scientists have warned that the goals of the Paris Agreement of 2015 are outdated, and the targets for curbing carbon emissions need to be revised. Erratic weather, the melting of polar ice-caps, glaciers shrinking in the Himalaya and other climate-induced changes that scientists expected to happen in 2030 are already taking place. Read also:  Nepal must prepare for climate migration, Sonia Awale      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Women in climate hot spots face challenges adapting, Marty Logan The reason: carbon emissions are going up instead of down. The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere crossed 408 parts per million last week — several orders of magnitude higher than before the industrial revolution, when it never rose above 300. Just to put it in perspective, all the changes we see happening around the world due to global warming have been set off by a temperature rise of only 1oC since human society started burning fossil fuels like coal. Yet, in the best-case scenario global average temperature is set to rise by at least 2oC in the next 30 years. In its Emissions Gap Report 2019 last week, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) warned that countries need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 7.6% a year between 2020 and 2030 in order to cap temperature increase at 1.5oC, as agreed in Paris. But the US has pulled out of the Paris Agreement, and major emitters of carbon dioxide have not reduced their emissions as agreed. To meet the Paris targets, greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut by 40% by 2030 and countries need to become carbon neutral by 2050. Read also: Clock starts ticking at COP25, Josie Wang The carbon footprint of tourism COP25’s motto is ‘Time To Act’, and it is hoped the 50 heads of state attending the meeting will do just that. Environmental activists are holding a parallel ‘Social Summit for Climate’ to pressure governments to not backtrack on commitments. Yet, conspicuous by their absence in Madrid are US President Donald Trump, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. Together they represent more than half the total emissions of greenhouse gases worldwide today.  Scientists have painted an apocalyptic picture of what will happen if the world fails to act. Rising global temperatures will lead to heat stress, falling food production, continental-scale forest fires, receding icecaps and rising sea levels. All these slow-onset disasters will have an impact on food production and human habitation, forcing tens of millions to relocate. The climate crisis is already leading indirectly to political instability and conflict, which in turn adds to migration pressure. Aside from all the other changes like mass extinction of species and collapse of natural ecosystems, it is migration that will have the most profound impact on human society. Some of these challenges are supposed to be discussed this week in Madrid, as delegations deliberate on the nexus between climate and migration. The UNFCCC’s task force on displacement will present its report, and rich countries will also have to fund the under-pledged $100 billion Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage. Read also:  The Third Pole is warming faster than expected, Kunda Dixit Terrifying assessment of a Himalayan melting, Kunda Dixit       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); To be sure, humans have been migrating throughout history, forced to move due to natural climate cycles or the advance of the Ice Age. However, this is the first time they will be migrating because of human-induced changes to the climate. People migrate due to sudden disasters like cyclones, floods, wildfires or droughts. But they will also relocate because of slow-onset changes like sea-level rise and erratic rainfall patterns. The lesson of the past two years is that slow-onset is not so slow anymore. The world has reached a tipping point, where small quantitative changes have created larger non-linear irreversible movement of people. This poses huge implications for politics and security. People are leaving the mountains due to landslides and floods, drylands because of water stress and coastal areas due to sea-level rise. Their destinations are overcrowded urban areas where they are even more vulnerable. A sign of things to come was Cyclone Fani, which forced 3.5 million people in India to be displaced earlier this year.  Read also: Climate climax, Editorial Climate damage, Editorial The World Bank estimates that by 2050, nearly 150 million people in South and Southeast Asia may become climate refugees. Sea level rise alone is expected to displace 50 million people from Bangladesh and India. Unless Nepal’s subsistence farmers get irrigation and other support to survive erratic monsoons, they will have no choice but to move. As our reports this week show, outmigration of Nepalis is now increasing, partly due to climate change. With the men gone, women are left to cope with the impacts of the climate emergency on their own.  Nepal also needs to do much more to reduce petroleum demand — not just to save the planet but also to save its own economy. In the end, it all boils down to vision and governance to recognise the climate crisis and be ready for its effects. Being unprepared will be much more costly in the long run.

As world leaders gather in Madrid this week for the Climate Summit, it is interesting to note that exactly 10 years ago this week Nepali Times #479 was discussing the Copenhagen Climate Summit of 2009. Excerpt from an editorial from 4-10 December 2009: ‘The people in the mountains of Nepal do not know that the futures of their children and grandchildren are tied up with how the international climate change conference next week in Copenhagen goes. Will the rich countries agree to cut back to 40% of 1990 emissions in the next 10 years (which scientists warn is needed to keep the average rise of global temperatures to within two degrees Celsius) or will they stall at the 13% the Americans say is as far as they can go?

 Photo: MINISTRY OF LABOUR EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY
























Politics is dirty. The manpower business is dirtier. Mixing the two can mean the difference of life or death for hundreds of thousands of desperate Nepalis seeking work overseas. Labour Minister Gokarna Bista was sacked last week in the cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister K P Oli under pressure from the recruitment mafia – the cartel of unscrupulous middlemen who profit from the blood, sweat and tears of fellow Nepalis. The recruiters had been baying for his head ever since Bista started dismantling the corrupt system that profited from exploiting and abusing workers.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Immediately after the minister’s removal, the Nepal Association of Foreign Employment Agencies (NAFEA) published a press release warning the Nepal government’s Department of Foreign Employment to take decisions only after consultation with them. Is that a threat? You bet it is. And it shows just how powerful the mafia is that it can go about intimidating the state. What is more, NAFEA’s blatant warning was a not-so-subtle ‘you are next’ reminder to Bista’s successor, Rameswar Rai Yadav, not to deign obstruct their rent-seeking activities by pushing through Bista’s reforms. Prime Minsiter Oli ostensibly carried out his long-awaited reshuffle to address public disillusionment with his administration’s failure of governance. Given that  honest heads rolled, politicians with questionable reputation were inducted, and corrupt non-performers were retained, the intention was to consolidate Oli’s position ahead of his prolonged absence for health reasons. It had nothing to do with rewarding integrity and effectiveness. Bista represented a much-needed voice in the foreign employment industry, but his strong stance against unscrupulous recruiters cost him his job. Within weeks of assuming power, he stopped workers from going to Malaysia in order to break the syndicate that was overcharging workers. His ministry amended the Foreign Employment Act, reducing the number of manpower companies from over 1,200 to 850 by increasing their security deposit and facilitating mergers. This was to ensure that only professional and honest organisations remained in the industry, and to stop recruitment companies from cutting competition by engaging in visa trading. Bista was aggressively pursuing bilateral agreements with countries including Malaysia, Japan, UAE and Mauritius, which included provisions on equal pay for equal work and zero cost for migrant workers. To minimise fraudulent job offers his ministry required that all demand letters for workers be verified at Nepali diplomatic missions abroad. The agreement with Japan barred recruitment agencies, given the record of aspirant workers paying more than Rs1 million each for opportunities in Japan. These pro-worker reforms cut the illegitimate profits of recruitment agencies who had it easy in the past and consequently, vociferously contested his position. Bista was starting to get crossborder recognition for his initiatives. Following the signing of the Nepal-Malaysia MoU, a writ submitted at the Supreme Court in Dhaka against a recruitment syndicate in Bangladesh that sent workers to Malaysia referred to Bista’s initiative as a model. He took a lead in the Colombo Process to bring labour-sending countries together. Yet, his sacking was expected. A recent editorial in this paper warned about how many wanted the Malaysia agreement to fail. In the last 20 months, the wave of rumours about Bista’s possible ousting had demoralised his ministry. Bista’s comrades in the party were protecting the mafia, and were also jealous of his popularity as a can-do labour minister, and in his previous job as water resource minister.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Reshuffling politicians comes with consequences that are not immediately apparent. The bureaucrats Bista inspired are despondent. The message this episode conveys is discouraging for any Nepali who wants to innovate, break the status quo, and who does not want to be complacent. It is too early to judge the new labour minister’s capacity or integrity. But Bista’s unceremonious ouster sends the message to others in government is to lie low and play it safe.   Bista’s zero-cost migration initiative would have been difficult to enforce not just for Nepal but for all labour-sending countries faced with this shared challenge. With his departure, the Oli administration has sent a clear message that predatory recruiters are free to swindle poor Nepali workers as much as they want, exploiting their desperation for jobs. Lasts Thursday on 21 November, Bista walked out of Singha Darbar after his farewell event and took a taxi home. He looked undefeated, perhaps validated by the outpouring of support in the social media. His last words to his despondent team and gathered media: “The post of a minister is temporary. Life itself is temporary. I am coming out of this with more inspiration and vigour to serve the country.” 









































10 years ago this week 















Ten years ago this week the Nepali Times edition  #478 (27 Nov 2009 – 03 Dec 2009) talked about how the prime minister was in Singapore for health treatment and the country was in disarray. Sound familiar? Excerpt from editorial: It is the curse of Nepali politics that a party boasts about its democratic credentials by ‘allowing’ parliament to function for three days’. The most inclusive house ever elected in Nepali history was blocked for five months, there is a logjam of legislation waiting for ratification, the budget delay deadlocked development, and important national issues were not debated. Meanwhile, despite the drama of the NC and Maoist leaders meeting around a hospital bed in Singapore, there is no end in sight to the political deadlock. At this stage, it is difficult to say what NC Chairman Girija Prasad Koirala seeks to achieve by forming a ‘high-level political mechanism’ when grassroots politics bristles with antipathy and apathy towards the governing coalition.

 Inaugural session of Power Summit 2019.
























It is that time of year again — another Power Summit is taking place. The agenda and content of this conclave 21-22 November was no different from all past summits: the need for large reservoir projects to meet winter demand and river regulation, pricing of peak power for export, and balancing supply-demand. And as always, the elephant in the room is India’s strategic interest in Nepal’s water resources. Going back to the Nepali Times archives for coverage of past summits, we noticed a pattern. None of the big reservoir projects like West Seti or Tama Kosi 3, designed primarily to export power to India, ever got off the ground. In fact, the state actively sabotaged them. It is no secret in trade circles that regulated flow of water from the Himalayan tributaries of the Ganges, and the involvement of Chinese contractors, raised hackles down South.  






























 Photo: SURAJ KUMAR BHUJEL






























Similarly, attempts to invest in large solar farms in the trans-Himalayan region of Upper Mustang were abruptly cancelled by the PMO this year, apparently due to opposition from up North.  So, there isn’t just one, but two elephants in the room. The inability of successive Nepal governments to steer an independent energy policy and gain backing of its large neighbours stymied large projects. Investors were also deterred by government indecision, red tape and blatant extortion.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The Power Summit this week, organised by the Independent Power Producers’ Association of Nepal (IPPAN) with the motto ‘Powering the Asian Century’, is thrashing out these same issues. At a time when Nepal needs a new paradigm and strong political will for energy security, the same politicians who failed to deliver since 1990 are in power. It would be naïve to expect much from them. The miracle is that despite governments actively discouraging investors, Nepal has now emerged from a decade of power cuts, new energy projects are coming into operation every other month, and the popular head of the Nepal electricity Authority (NEA), Kulman Ghising, is saying that the problem now is not lack of electricity but people not using what is generated. Read Also:  The Water Emergency, Ajaya Dixit Decentralising (hydro)power,Gyanendra Lal Pradhan  An energy windfall for Nepal?, Kushal Gurung   




























Indeed during this monsoon, Nepal actually exported power to India for the first time. Yet Nepal’s widening trade deficit with India will not be redressed by exporting power, however much politicians like to boast that we can. The country’s national strategy should be to generate enough power to slash tariffs so that Nepalis can afford electricity for cooking and setting up small and medium-scale enterprises.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As energy entrepreneur Gyanendra Lal Pradhan argues in his commentary ‘Decentralising (hydro)power’ in this edition, the PMO must fast-track its plan for 6 hydropower projects in 6 provinces in 6 years. This would generate enough electricity for Nepal to phase out power imports from India, which this fiscal year amounted to Rs20 billion. LPG imports could be cut by Rs60-70 billion if enough Nepalis switched to cooking with electricity, and electric railways would cut diesel imports by Rs100 billion. In total, Nepal would save Rs200 billion — a third of its total import bill from India.  As Kushal Gurung of the Energy Development Council writes in this issue Nepal must complement hydropower by picking the low-hanging fruit of solar and wind. Mustang alone has the potential to generate 3,000MW from solar and wind projects. Transporting 60m turbine towers to remote areas will present a problem, and wind generates power only in the afternoons when demand is lowest. Solar will not address evening peak demand. Even so, these two renewable energy sources can be built much faster than hydro, and are becoming cost-effective even for battery storage. 




























But there are several things that need to happen before that. First and foremost, Nepal’s politicians need to get their act together — a tall order at a time when they are pulling in different directions, and the Prime Minister is going to be absent for an extended period. Extortion, corruption and local opposition to large projects need to be urgently addressed if Nepal wants serious investors to fast-track investment. Political focus is critical because of overlapping jurisdiction over inter-provincial rivers, as well as negotiations with India to allay its fears over large reservoir projects. The NEA unbundling has to be implemented so that reforms like time-of-day pricing, solar net metering for households, further reducing system loss and pilferage, and aggressive promotion of LED can happen. As with everything else in Nepal, the answer to exploiting our vast energy potential lies in governance and vision. We need a clear business strategy for import substitution through energy self-sufficiency.

On the 40th anniversary of UNICEF in Nepal 10 years ago, former Under-Secretary General of the United Nations Kul Chandra Gautam praised Nepal’s achievements in child welfare. On the 50th anniversary, it looks like progress has stalled. Excerpt of Gautam’s comment in Nepali Times #477 of 20-26 November 2009: ‘In 1970 Nepal had the 12th highest child mortality rate in the world. By last year, we had moved ahead of 50 other countries, to rank 62nd. During this period the under-five mortality rate went down by nearly 80 per cent, from 250 to 51 per 1000. Four decades ago, 400,000 children were born every year, but 100,000 of them died before reaching their fifth birthday. Last year, 732,000 children were born, but less than 40,000 died. Forty years ago, barely a quarter of school-age children went to primary education. Today 90 per cent of children enrol in primary school, including a majority of girls.’

The dispute over the tri-junction of India, China and Nepal on the remotest northwestern tip of the country is the latest strain on bilateral relations.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The Sugauli Treaty of 1816 between the East India Company and the defeated Gorkhalis clearly stated that the main channel of the Mahakali River would form a shrunken Nepal’s western border with British India. But the Survey of India maps of 1850 and 1856 slyly tucked the area back into Garhwal. Successive rulers in faraway Kathmandu were either unaware or did not care that the boundary had been moved. After the Chinese annexation of Tibet in the 1950s, Nepal allowed India to put up 17 military checkpoints along its northern border. China and India fought a fierce Himalayan war in 1962 during which the Indian military set a base on the strategic Lipu Lekh Valley. That base is still there.  In 1969, Prime Minister Kirti Nidhi Bista got Delhi to remove all its checkpoints on the Nepal-China border, except the one in Kalapani. Was Lipu Lekh a quid pro quo for the removal of the other bases? Did King Mahendra sacrifice the region in return for Indian support for his takeover? Historians are divided. Whatever the case, the elected rulers of Nepal after 1990 used anti-Indian nationalism for political benefit, but did little to press Nepal’s legitimate claim over the territory. K P Oli, who now heads the united NCP in government, was one of the most vocal in Parliament demanding that India return the area. Current Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattrarai even led a student group to Kalapani to raise the Nepali flag in the tract occupied by India.  























 






















Many field reports from the area have just gathered dust in Singha Darbar. No action was ever taken, except when it was politically expedient to raise an anti-Indian drum beat. Nepal’s own official map in 1975 showed Lipu Khola as the boundary between Nepal and India, and not the Mahakali River. Ultra-nationalists cry themselves hoarse about ‘big bully’ India, but why would a neighbour respect your boundary if you yourself do not really care where it is?  New Delhi has not really been bothered about winning the hearts and minds of Nepalis, either. It believes in carrying the big stick and showing who’s boss. And all this is convenient for Nepal’s India-bashing pseudo-nationalists who have a handy excuse to take to the streets every time the border dispute flares up.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); For Prime Minister Oli the brouhaha could not have been better timed. It has allowed him to distract public attention away from his administration’s non-performance, and once more drape himself in the flag. But what good is it to work ourselves into a frenzy of territorialism over this tiny strip of land when our rulers do not seem to care what happens to the rest of the country over which they enjoy full sovereignty? This is also not one where Nepal can play India off against China. In fact, Beijing seems to be on the same page as New Delhi on the issue. As far back as 1954, India and China agreed to allow Indian pilgrims to use Lipu Lekh Pass on their holy trek to Lake Mansarovar. Lipu Lekh was discussed during visits by Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh to Beijing in 1999, by Chinese Premier Wen Jiaobao to Delhi in 2005, and by Chinese President Xi Jinping in India in 2014. A joint communiqué between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi in 2015 in Beijing listed Lipu Lekh as one of the Sino-Indian border passes through which the two countries agreed to conduct trade. 























 






















One of the few instances in Nepali history when anti-Chinese protests broke out in the streets of Kathmandu was four years ago after that India-China joint communiqué on Lipu Lekh. Yet, Nepal’s governments since then did not dare broach the subject with the Chinese, it was not even raised last month during President Xi’s state visit to Kathmandu. Nepal cannot go to war with India over this. (For one thing, our men are enlisted in their army.) How about first revising our own official map, and take up the matter at the highest level in every future bilateral? And they may as well also talk about disputes along the Tarai caused by rivers changing course, and border pillars mysteriously moving under cover of darkness. The time is right for dialogue: there is a government in Kathmandu with a solid two-thirds majority, we have rare all-party unity over the matter, and Nepal’s international stature is higher than it has been in a while.",/editorial,"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 11:20:56 +0000"

Now that all three festivals are over, it is time to remind ourselves of where we left off before the holidays. Lest we forget, in late September we saw a series of crackdowns on freedom of expression that had a dampening effect, especially on Internet content.  Elected demagogues worldwide learn fast: they have discovered that there is no need to kill journalists anymore — it is much more effective to kill journalism.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); By destroying the credibility of the media, citizens are no longer able to tell the difference between truths and lies, allowing rulers to get on (and get away) with wrongdoing. In this post-truth, fake news universe, the social web allows instantaneous spread of falsehood, rumours and manipulated information. This creates an environment for self-censorship, and the silencing of independent voices. One would have thought that with its landslide victory in the 2017 elections, the ruling Nepal Communist Party would be able to perform, deliver services and upgrade infrastructure. The media would have automatically heaped praises. But since it has not been able to deliver on its promises, the party with the thickest majority in Nepal’s democratic history has the thinnest skin.

The intention seems to be to take our freedoms away bit by bit so that we won’t even notice when they are all gone — rather like the traditional Chinese practice of torture and execution known as lingchi, death by a thousand cuts.  The story so far: Nepal’s new penal code last year criminalised the use of images deemed derogatory (section 295), slapped hefty fines and jail terms for recording conversations (section 293) and announced strict punishment for sending, receiving or using online data (section 298). It even banned Photoshopped images for the purpose of satire.Parliament introduced a bill to prohibit journalists from publishing personal information of public officials, ostensibly to protect officials’ privacy.Editors of mainstream newspapers were unceremoniously summoned to the Press Council for intimidating interrogations.Journalists at the RSS news agency were questioned for filing a story on the Dalai Lama being discharged from hospital in New Delhi while President Bidya Devi Bhandari was on a visit to Beijing.The Ministry of Communication and Information Technology is backing a draconian Media Council Bill through Parliament, which would criminalise speech on vague grounds.In June, vlogger Pranesh Gautam was jailed by police for five days for an irreverent review of a new Nepali movie.Satire singer Pashupati Sharma was threatened by ruling party toughies to take down a music video ridiculing the culture of corruption in high places.A person was tracked down and arrested earlier this year for poking fun at the Prime Minister on Facebook.The Information Technology Act can sentence people for 5 years in jail and levy a fine of up to Rs150,000 for ‘improper’ social media posts.

The former UML component of the NCP, which at least paid lip service to liberal democracy, is being subsumed by more authoritarian comrades in the party with erstwhile Maoist credentials. The emperor does not like it when it is pointed out that he is naked. Power does not like it when you speak truth to it. So, the knee-jerk reaction is to harm the messenger. The threat to freedom of expression today is not from despots, but elected leaders who have co-opted the legislature, judiciary and the security apparatus. The crackdowns in Nepal are not as bad as in the rest of the region. But that is not saying much, and it is hardly a consolation. Our goal must be to strengthen the four pillars of democracy, separating their powers and fortifying them to be more transparent and accountable.

10 years ago this week 





















A front page analysis in #475 of Nepali Times, 6-12 November 2009, shows that nothing much has changed in the Indian media’s depiction of Nepal: ‘Nepal and China suddenly loom large in the Indian media, and often both are mentioned together in jingoistic coverage that is said to be fed by leaks from hawks. After an incident on a border lake in Ladakh in mid-September, TV news channels aired alarmist coverage titled ‘Enter the Dragon’.  Another channel labelled Nepal the ‘Number Three Enemy’ of India after China and Pakistan. The main reason for the suspicion is the belief that Nepal’s Maoist government is getting too cosy with China. “Silently but speedily China is spreading its wings in the erstwhile Hindu kingdom, mainly to unleash anti-India propaganda,” wrote the Times of India last week.

Ever since Time magazine printed a story in 1992 titled ‘Goodbye Shangrila’, Nepal’s travel trade and government have tried to clean up the country’s international image. Visitor arrivals plummeted during the conflict years, and even after the ceasefire there was negative publicity about the instability, strikes and shutdowns. The earthquake and the Blockade also hit tourism hard.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But Nepal is such a solid brand, and such a unique tourism product, that visitor numbers are picking up again. Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada is credited with picking the target of 2 million as a way to revive income from tourism to help balance Nepal’s growing trade deficit. Read also: The Nepal Brand, Editorial In the 1980s, tourism made up 22% of Nepal’s GDP. It now contributes only 4%, not necessarily because tourism is down, but because other sectors like remittances and trade have grown. Under Tourism Minister Rabindra Adhikari, 2020 was chosen to promote Nepal internationally so that we could reach the magic 2 million figure. But Adhikari was killed in a helicopter crash last year, and travel trade executives say promotion activities have not been effective enough. President Bidya Devi Bhandari inaugurated Visit Nepal Year 2020 at Kathmandu’s main stadium on 1 January with fireworks and a flypast of military helicopters.

The other deterrent is that Nepal is an expensive place to travel to because the price of aviation fuel here is double that in other airports in the region.

Nepal’s public health system has no mechanism for recording suicides, and the only statistics about suicides can be found in police records. This data shows that about 5,000 Nepalis kill themselves every year.  But since only police records are counted and attempted suicides are not reported, the official data gives no sense of the incidence of people trying to take their own lives.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 






















 Based on police data and projections, the World Health Organisation put Nepal as the country with the 7th highest suicide rate in the world (24.9 per 100,000). Public health experts say that suicide is just the symptom, and that the real disease is poor mental health. Read also: Suicide by pesticide in Nepal, Sonia Awale Most people who commit suicide suffer from depression and other mental illnesses like schizophrenia and substance abuse disorders. The Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC) is for the first time conducting a nationwide survey of mental health by year-end, and already the picture is not looking good.

“From our pilot survey, we found depression in 3.4% of people, and suicidal tendencies in one out of every ten Nepalis,” says Kriti Adhikari of NHRC.   Most of these people cannot access the counselling and treatment they need since Nepal has only 0.13 psychiatrists per 100,000 people, and most of them are concentrated in urban areas. Nepal Police is the only entity that deals with suicide, and it is more concerned about the criminality of the act than about mental health. “Nepal’s law classifies suicide and abetting suicide as crimes, so our priority is figuring out the criminal element of the cases,” explains police spokesperson Shailesh Thapa Chhetri. “There is no punishment for suicide because the person is already dead. But we investigate to find out if the death was a murder or a suicide.” Read also:  Suicide watch Down and Out, Smriti Basnet

The fact that Nepal Police personnel are not trained in mental health, and that the health system does not record suicides or suicide attempts means that there is no entry for suicide in the Health Information Management System, the database of all patients at government health facilities. This keeps suicides hidden.  “The police data on suicide understates the problem of mental health in Nepal,” says Ravi Shakya, a physician at Patan Hospital, which has a mental health department. “We know more men die from suicide than women and they tend to use more violent means. But in fact, many more women attempt suicide and fewer of them succeed. They may come to hospital, recover, and go back home, but that does not mean their mental illness is over.”      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Except at Patan Hospital, victims of attempted suicides receive no mental health counselling after their physical health improves. But last year the Ministry of Health and Population appointed a focal person for mental health for the first time. This focal person, Phanindra Baral, acknowledges that Nepal has not done enough to address mental health and suicide prevention. Read also: End pain, not lives, Anjana Rajbhandary “There are not enough psychiatrists in Nepal to serve the whole country. So for now, we are training the current health staff in basic mental health issues and counseling,” says Baral. “We are taking the program to 41 districts this year, and hope to serve all 77 districts in the next two years.” For the first time, the Ministry has included mental health as a priority in its proposal to the National Planning Commission, hoping to see that reflected in the next five year plan. But till that happens, there are other things to be done. “Mental health still has a stigma and people are not willing to acknowledge it or seek help. The first step is to raise awareness of mental health and suicide,” says Uden Maharjan, public health researcher and co-author of a paper on suicides in Nepal. “We need suicide helplines and people should be made aware of how to access them so they can open up.”   Read also:  Self-destruct, Indu Nepal   Dead end of the Korean Dream, Ki Mindo in Seoul 



























































A note on suicide notes 



























With the spread of social media, police have to contend with suicide notes not just on paper but also on the Internet platforms. But the real challenge of dealing with suicide note is still the same: the mental health. Should the declaration of a dead person be believed? And if the dying declaration blames someone else for that death, how credible is the allegation? Ravi Shakya, a physician at Patan Hospital says that dying declarations are usually held to be credible evidence. “When someone declares that they are want to die and proceed to kill themselves, we have every reason to take such a note seriously,” says Shakya. “However, if they blame another person, we cannot assume guilt based on the allegation. We have to take into consideration that the person who committed suicide could have been mentally ill.” The police also take such suicide notes seriously, but prioritise criminal investigation over mental health. “A suicide note is evidence, so we treat it with utmost care. We analyse the handwriting to make sure it matches the dead person’s. If the dead person blames other people, we consider them under suspicion until they are proven innocent,” says Shailesh Thapa of Nepal Police. The police do not necessarily question the sanity of the person who wrote the note, therefore sidelining the mental health aspect of the suicide.

Standing in his field on the outskirts of Pokhara and below the dazzling snows of the Annapurna mountains, Xiang Shaohua points to peach saplings in his orchard. The seedlings were sent to him by his son and daughter who are studying back home in China. And just like Xiang himself, the peach are striking roots in Nepal’s soil.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Xiang first came to Nepal 10 years ago as a tourist, travelled to Pokhara and was so mesmerised by the place and people here that he never left. Today, he rents 2 hectares of farm and is growing lettuce, cauliflower and fruits commercially to sell to the market and restaurants in the lakeside tourist town. He also works as a subcontractor at Pokhara airport, and at other infrastructure projects. Read also: Miyahara-san: a life devoted to Nepal, Kunda Dixit “In the beginning, it was only supposed to be for three years, and if it did not work out, I planned to go back to China,” Xiang recalls. “It has not all been smooth sailing, but it has been worth it.” Xiang now has his father and wife helping out at the farm. The fact that he came from a farming family back in Sichuan where the climate and soil are similar to Nepal, has been helpful. Xiang says his most challenging period was during the 2015 blockade, when supplies were scarce. He felt like quitting, but realised he had greater responsibilities. “Actually, I could have left, but that would have meant that my Nepali employees would be out of their jobs,” recalls 32-year-old Xiang, who speaks Nepali with a distinct Pokhara lilt and considers himself “half Nepali”. Everyone here knows him by his Nepali nickname, Sandesh, and some call him China’s “non-governmental ambassador” to Nepal. Read also: From Liz Hawley in Kathmandu, Kunda Dixit His Nepali side was heartbroken to see the destruction after the 2015 earthquake, and reminded him of the deadly Sichuan earthquake of 2008.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); While tens of thousands of youth from Pokhara have migrated to the Gulf or Malaysia for work, Xiang is proof that there is plenty to do in Nepal itself, and it is possible to prosper if one is prepared for hard work.  























 






















“Farming is very labour intensive, and I notice that most educated young Nepalis are unwilling to do it,” says Xiang, who recalls the first time he came to Pokhara and noticed that farm productivity could be easily improved. That is when he saw an opportunity to put some of his own farming experience to good use, and stayed. Now, Xiang regards Nepal as his second home, and his Nepali neighbours regard the cheerful Nepali-speaking Chinese as a Nepali too. Read also: Goodbye Jan and Christine “I know Nepal. I know what Nepalis need. At the same time, I can communicate with Chinese enterprises to know what they want, and I can be a good go-between,” says Xiang. With the new airport, and Chinese contractors working on various hydropower projects in Central Nepal, Xiang sees lots of opportunity for mutual learning between Nepali and Chinese people. Xiang is not interested in making the quick buck, and says: “I would rather do something I like doing even if I do not make money for a while.” Farming is not that profitable, but it is a passion and he enjoys growing food among people he likes, and in a land he calls his second home. In his office, a poster on the wall in Mandarin characters says: ‘Remain true to your aspiration’. Xiang appears to follow his motto to the letter.

Of the 25,308 suicides recorded by the police in Nepal in the past five years, poisoning was the method of choice of 6,213 and pesticides were the most common form of poison used. Suicide by pesticides is the easiest, cheapest and the quickest way to kill oneself in Nepal. A 2015 study in Chitwan showed that 90% of all poisoning cases resulted from deliberate ingestion of pesticides. Hospital and forensic data over the years reveal that pesticide self-poisoning kills at least 1,000 people in Nepal annually.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 






















“Pesticides are in fact a far greater threat than what police records show. There are many people who make the attempt and survive due to insufficient dose or medical treatment,” says Ravi Shakya, a mental health specialist at Patan Hospital. “If we also count attempted suicides, pesticide is the most preferred method of suicide in Nepal.” Read also: Nepal’s suicide rate vastly underestimated, Sewa Bhattarai Shailesh Thapa Chhetri of Nepal Police agrees: “Previously, hanging used to be the most common method of suicide, as people had the easiest access to ropes. Now, access to pesticides is even easier. Almost every household has pesticides, whether to kill cockroaches or to spray in the farms.”

And as the import of pesticides increases, the hazardous chemicals will only be more accessible for self-harm. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development claims that Nepal’s pesticide consumption is 396g per hectare but research by the Netherlands-based Wageningen University shows it to be 2.9kg per hectare in vegetable patches.  “Pesticides that kill people are readily available in the market, they do not need prescriptions and anyone can buy it,” says Dilli Ram Sharma, former Director General of the Department of Agriculture. “To make matters worse, farmers always go for the most toxic ones that kill all pests at once.” Read also: Suicide watch

A 2014 National Forensic Science Laboratory study that looked at the trends of clinical toxicology cases in Nepal from 2002-2012 showed that of the total poisoning cases due to insecticides, 71% were by ingesting the organophosphorus compounds Metacid (Methyl parathion) and Nuvan (Dichlorovos). Pyrethroid, carbamate and organochlorine were also used. Some of these pesticides are actually banned in Nepal, but available over the counter.  A Central Police Forensic Science Laboratory study conducted over the past three years shows organophosphorus compounds and aluminium phosphide as the most common active ingredients in poisoning cases. Data from seven tertiary hospitals across Nepal found Celphos (aluminium phosphide used to kill rodents) as the most common pesticide in those admitted for poisoning.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The Centre for Pesticide Suicide Prevention in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh and Nepal Public Health Foundation is collecting three years worth of hospital and forensic data to analyse self-poisoning. Prof Michael Eddleston of the University of Edinburgh is the principal investigator and was recently in Nepal.  “I don’t think it’s ever possible to use pesticide safely. You have to make pesticides non-toxic to humans, animals and the environment. We are trying to identify the problematic pesticides that are killing people here and provide that information to the concerned authorities so that they are banned and replaced with safer pesticides,” Eddleston told Nepali Times. The Nepal Public Health Foundation is also organising a two-day national conference (9-10 January) focussed on healthy farming and reducing pesticide use. Indeed Bangladesh, Korea and Sri Lanka have shown that removing highly hazardous pesticides from agricultural practice is key to preventing suicide deaths without affecting agricultural output. The good news is that some of the most toxic pesticides are being banned in Nepal.  In 2019, when the Centre for Pesticide Suicide Prevention pinpointed Dichlorvos and 3g tablets of aluminium phosphide as the most common causes of pesticide suicide in Nepal, the Plant Quarantine and Pesticide Management Centre placed a ban on both the pesticides, to be enforced after a grace period of two years for the chemicals already on the market.   Similarly, before Metacid (Methyl parathion) was prohibited in 2006, up to 68% of Nepalis killing themselves were using the chemical. After the ban, this figure came down to 8%. “Prevention is better than cure and that is exactly what pesticide ban does. And this has a double benefit: it reduces suicide death while also bringing down the rampant use of pesticides in agriculture, leading to a decline in pesticide residue,” adds Sharma, who retired after banning the two pesticides. Despite the ban, however, the smuggling of pesticides across the open border with India remains a challenge, and experts call for crossborder cooperation to fight it.   Says Rakesh Ghimire of Teaching Hospital: “Control of pesticides especially in agricultural areas is important, but as important is pesticide information centres and treatment when the poisoning happens.”",/here-now,"Thu, 09 Jan 2020 09:17:19 +0000"

They piled them high in the courtyard, and set them alight.

Nepal’s future may not be in hydropower, as most assume, but actually in the dung heap. A new industrial-scale biogas plant near Pokhara has proved that livestock and farm waste producing flammable methane gas can replace imported LPG and chemical fertiliser.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Over the past 30 years, Nepal has become a world leader in spreading locally-designed household biogas digesters. There are now 300,000 of them, helping reduce deforestation, improving people’s health and lifting women out of drudgery and poverty. Now, a company in Pokhara has enlarged household digesters into an industrial scale plant that uses climate-friendly technology that could ultimately be scaled  nationwide to reduce Nepal’s balance of trade gap.  Read also: Father of Nepal’s gobar gas industry, David McConkey Mustering up energy to face the future, Om Astha Rai Kushal Gurung’s grandfather was in the British Army, and he also applied for recruitment but failed the eyesight test. So, he set up Gandaki Urja in Pokhara that works with wind, solar and hydropower, but he believes Nepal’s best option for sustainable growth lies in energy from waste. “Nepal must abandon fossil fuels, but even among renewable energy sources biogas has a three-fold advantage. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and is therefore climate friendly. It allows us to manage raw waste. And it can slash our import bill for LPG and chemical fertiliser,” says Gurung. “It is a win-win-win.” 























 






















A tipper truck has just arrived from Gorkha at Gandaki Urja’s biogas plant at Kotre near Pokhara, which with its dome digester looks like a nuclear reactor. The truck tilts its container to empty 5 tons of smelly poultry waste into a pit where rotting vegetables and cow dung from a farm in Syangja are all being mixed before being fed into the 4,000 cubic meter digester that is kept inflated. In the absence of oxygen, bacteria already in the cow dung go to work to break down the waste into methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. The impurities are removed by filters to produce 200 cylinders of bio-CNG a day which are sold to big hotels and restaurants in Pokhara. Read also: No smoke without fire, Ajaya Dixit No alternative to alternative energy, Bhrikuti Rai Customers pay a deposit for the cylinders and pressure regulators, and usually use up about two cylinders a day. The cost per kg for the bio-Compressed Natural Gas (bio-CNG) is the same as the state subsidised Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG). However, customers prefer the biogas because it saves them up to 30% cost because it has higher calorific value than LPG, and there is no residue that goes waste.  “So far, the customers are satisfied, and we see demand growing in the future as word spreads,” says Ashim Kayastha, Director of Gandaki Urja. Half the plant’s revenue comes from bio-CNG and the other half from the effluent which is dried and sold as organic fertiliser. The plant can produce up to 11,000 tons of fertiliser a year and is sold to surrounding farms.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The future of bio-CNG depends on scaling up the technology since any municipality generating more than 40 tons of biodegradable waste per day could have its own biogas plant. Nepal imports 500,000 tons of chemical fertiliser a year, and if each of 100 municipalities produced 5,000 tons of organic fertiliser Nepal could slash its import bill.

This could also significantly reduce the country’s annual import of Rs33 billion worth of LPG from India which grew four-fold in the past 10 years, making up 2.5% of Nepal’s total import bill. But to scale up, industrial biogas needs the same government incentives as hydro, solar and wind power. At the moment hydropower investors enjoy a 100% corporate tax holiday for 10 years, and 50% for the next five years. There is only 1% tax on imports of equipment for solar, wind and hydropower, there is no such provision for the equipment for industrial scale biogas. Instead, there is a tax on interest, and also VAT on bio-CNG. “The government should look at this not only as an energy project, but at its multifaceted benefits,” says Kushal Gurung of Gandaki Urja. “There is a waste-to-energy and fertiliser angle, too. If we want to make Nepal fully organic in the next ten years, projects like these need to be prioritised.” Gandaki Urja got a boost from an unlikely source, Business Oxygen (BO2) in Kathmandu which helps entrepreneurs running Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to scale up by injecting equity and providing technical assistance. Read also: Putting wind in the map, Kushal Gurung Climate risk to hydropower investment, Ajaya Dixit Says Siddhant Pandey of BO2: “We are always on the lookout for climate investments, and we realised that bio-CNG would be an incredible adaptive resilience investment. It would displace imports of LPG and fertiliser. It was going to be clean, no carbon footprint, and it made business sense because it met our internal return on investment expectation.” The challenges are ensuring reliable sources of raw material and building knowhow for the technology within Nepal. Says Pandey: “The Pokhara plant is a drop in the ocean, it can abe replicated in all 7 provinces. We know it is scalable, and it depends how proactive provincial governments will be.”",/here-now,"Thu, 02 Jan 2020 09:46:34 +0000"

 From Korala Pass on the Nepal-China border facing south. Annapurna and Nilgiri in the distance.
























As the road meanders uphill towards my village of Dhee in Upper Mustang, I recall my childhood amidst these mountains. Life was hard then, things people take for granted now were privileges only few could afford. I walked 11 days to Pokhara for my SLC exams. Seeing cars was magical. We were more likely to see helicopters in Mustang than vehicles.         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 






















There was only one primary school in whole Kingdom of Lo then. It was a six hour walk away, and the only secondary school was in Jomsom, three days away. Thanks to the secretary of the late King of Mustang, Chandra Bahadur Thakali, I stayed with his family in Jomsom paying his family a rent of Rs310 a month in 1976. That was a what a full-grown sheep cost then. Mustang was a restricted area, outsiders were rare. Today, there are western trekkers, Nepalis on motorcycles all on the motorable road that joins Lo Manthang to Jomsom. In fact ‘domestic tourists’ are more visible than non-Nepali visitors. And that is the biggest change in Mustang today: The Road. Accessibility has accelerated change in this kingdom within a republic. The 11-day trek from Pokhara can be done in one day – the highway may be precarious but it is a new lifeline.    











 


















 A team is walking down from a cave Tang Tang Phu where I began my journey of Buddhism studies 50 years ago
























Subsistence agriculture and pastoralism have been replaced with trade, and now with outmigration and tourism. The road connects Mustang’s pristine culture, stark beauty and fragile ecosystem to the outside world. Accessibility has also helped upgrade health facilities, improve education and brought modern everyday necessities which were nearly non-existent in the past. With no knowledge or access to primary health care, locals mostly depended on traditional amchis healers. With modern medicine and better nutrition, most health indicators have improved.

Food was always a scarce during my Mustang childhood. Mules, horses, yaks, people and sometimes even goats had to travel for a week days to transport grain to the villages, making it expensive. Although we ate nutritious local produce like buckwheat, beans, wheat, potatoes and barley, the road has brought processed and packaged food. However, the road has also contributed to food security by bringing down the cost of grain and other essentials.     
























 Sumdi Chhorten from the north.
























One big change now is that the few local primary schools that did exist are now all closed. With increased income, locals prefer to send their children to Jomsom, Pokhara or even Kathmandu. Even so, education and exposure to the wider world has given Mustang’s youngsters a deeper understanding of the value of their cultural and natural heritage.   Also adding to the exposure is the interaction with tourists, who come to Mustang to admire its unique cultural heritage and stunning scenery. This has allowed locals to realise that they are worth preserving, and has contributed to restoring pride in their way of life.        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); However, development comes at a cost. With the road, there is now pressure on the region’s fragile ecology. Haphazard road construction has triggered landslides, and added sediment to the rivers. Drainage has been disrupted, creating water shortages as springs go dry. Climate breakdown has exacerbated this crisis. 
























 From Tsarang village looking east towards  Damodar Kunda 
























Traffic will increase once the Kali Gandaki Corridor is upgraded to connect to the China border at Korala. It is essential to urgently carry out an assessment of its impact on the environment and plan for sustainable and green infrastructure.     Climate change has changed rain and snowfall patterns, but on the flipside, it has also had positive impact: cucumbers, tomatoes and  vegetables never used to grow here because of the cold are now plentiful. Mustang apples can now grow in areas which were not suitable for the orchards. 
























 Fields lie fallow in Ghami due to water shortage and outmigration.

On balance, road connectivity has provided a strong boost to the economy through tourism. It has connected produce to markets, workers to jobs, students to schools, and patients to hospitals. 




























The once forbidden kingdom is now connected to the world, and is now at the crossroads, it is vital that decisions to balance development with conservation of nature and cultural heritage be taken now so Mustang’s fragile beauty is preserved for the next generation.

When Nepal chose famous Chinese actress Xu Qing to be its Goodwill Ambassador to promote Visit Nepal Year 2020 in China, she did not need much convincing. She was already in love with Nepal. “My heart was racing when I saw the breathtaking view of the Annapurna range,” she gushed in a Weibo post from Pokhara, “This is the life I yearn for.”      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Xu posted photos of herself posing in front of Machapuchre, boating on Phewa Lake, wearing a marigold garland, and taking selfies with smiling local children. Those images and videos went to 17 million of the actress’ followers on Chinese social media. Xu Qing, who starred in her first film in 1990, has won numerous awards in the past 30 years. Many of her roles are deeply rooted in the hearts of people, which makes her hugely popular on social media. Her account on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform in China, has more than 17 million followers. “It was a wise decision for Nepal to choose her as an influencer to promote tourism from China,” says Chinese art curator Justin Zhao who has lived in Nepal for seven years, and founded the Himalayan Light Art Award. “Next door China is the biggest potential market for tourism development in Nepal, and the number of Chinese tourists to Nepal is growing rapidly.”

Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi has also been projecting China’s soft power in Nepal through her social media feeds to promote Visit Nepal 2020. In a Tweet on new year’s eve on Tuesday, she posted pictures of herself modelling in Patan Darbar Square and wrote: ‘True beauty always touches the deep heart. Beautiful Nepal with history, diversity and nature deserves a visit. Wish #VisitNepal2020 successful!’ And she tagged Nepal’s Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai.  From January to October 2019, there were 134,281 Chinese tourists in Nepal, up nearly 10% for the same period last year. Chinese visitors account for nearly 14% of arrivals by nationality, second only to India. Numbers started going up in 2011 after Nepal announced free visas for Chinese nationals.  “Chinese Buddhists and those who enjoy adventure sports are the two most common types of Chinese tourists in Nepal,” notes Wang Ziping, who runs a restaurant in Pokhara. Indeed, many of the visitors have nothing but praise for Nepal’s natural beauty and its friendly people. ‘Although Nepal is poor, it is the happiest country in the world. You can actually see the real smiles on people’s faces and feel their inner comfort. I taste a bit of my dream life here,” noted one visitor on an online post. Adds another: ‘In the southern slopes of the Himalaya, you can see the cultural diversity of South Asia. People of different religious faiths live in peace here. They understand each other and develop together. 























 

















 











 

















 






















There are also negative comments, and deal mostly with poor infrastructure and the high airfares. Says restauranteur Wang: “Air tickets to Nepal are too expensive. The price in the peak season is more than double to similar destinations. If the price of air tickets can be reduced to about the same as that of flying to Thailand, more people would love to come.” With a target of two million tourists in 2020, entrepreneurs have made efforts targeting potential Chinese visitors, but many say that unless the infrastructure bottlenecks like airports and highways are fixed it will be difficult to meet the target even if the volume of Chinese tourists reaches 500,000 this year.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But here in Pokhara, restaurants, hotels and paragliding companies are gearing up for the influx of Chinese tourists. At Lakeside restaurant menus are in Chinese, as are shop signs.  Shopkeepers do their part by calling out “Ni hao” to welcome any Chinese-looking person. “We have Mandarin courses so our staff can communicate with Chinese tourists,” says Prakritee Gurung, manager at Shangri-La Village Resort. Across town at Fishtail Lodge, nearly half the 24,000 guests in 2019 were Chinese tourists.  























 






















Nepal is getting ready for the first tri-nation Nepal-India-China Expo (NICE) 21-24 Feburary for joint tourism promotion. Nepal is strategically placed to be the tourism go-between for the two Asian giants. Tourism entrepreneurs in Pokhara who have been lobbying for decades to have Pokhara International Airport built are excited that it will finally open next year, and there will be direct flights between Chinese cities and Pokhara, bypassing Kathmandu. Pokhara became famous in China after the popular television serial Deng Feng Lai (Up in the Wind) was filmed on location here where the two protagonists took a paragliding flight. Since then, many young Chinese have flocked to Pokhara. For Wang Ziping it was love at first sight with Pokhara. He came on a visit, and never left, deciding to open the Pokhara Restaurant on Lakeside. He says: “Pokhara International Airport is about to be finished and there will be more Chinese tourists flying directly here. I am sure business will pick up.”",/here-now,"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 12:48:03 +0000"

Michael Eddleston is a professor of Clinical Toxicology at the University of Edinburg with over two decades of experience in suicide by ingesting pesticide. He is also the director of Centre for Pesticide Suicide Prevention and was recently in Nepal as a principal investigator of a research analysing self-poisoning in the country. Excerpts of his conversation with Nepali Times. Nepali Times: What is pesticide suicide? Michael Eddleston: All of us feel suicidal from time to time. Unless you are very depressed or have a mental illness, you survive the feeling and move on with your life. The green revolution brought highly toxic pesticides into homes that people drank in the moment of impulse without a second thought.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Suicide rates went up massively in Asia because spontaneous acts of self-harm became lethal. These are accidental suicides, people don’t really want to die, drinking pesticide or a poison in many parts of Asia is an expression of anger or frustration. 






















What is the burden of pesticide suicide in the region? Pesticide suicides have killed some 15 million people, mostly in this region of South and East Asia since the 1960s. The numbers have come down to about 150,000 people a year. China alone used to have 180,000 pesticide suicides per year back in the 1990s and it has come down to 50,000, partly due to mechanisation and restriction of Highly Hazardous Pesticides (HHP). In Nepal, 15-20% of suicides are from ingesting pesticides and about 1,000 people die every year.  Read also: Suicide by pesticide in Nepal, Sonia Awale Nepal’s suicide rate vastly underestimated, Sewa Bhattarai 










Do not shy away from seeking help. If you, or anyone you know, would like to speak to a trained mental health professional, please contact: TUTH Suicide Hotline: 9840021600 Transcultural Psychosocial Organization-Nepal Crisis Hotline: 1660 0102005 Mental Health Helpline Nepal: 1660 0133666 






















What can we do about it? Ideally we could move away from all pesticides like Sikkim has done with natural farming. But this might take time so for now the simplest answer is to ban HHPs and replace them with less toxic chemicals. So when people take poison, it’s not toxic and they don’t die.  There’s a clear data from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and South Korea showing that when you ban just a few particular pesticides which people are commonly using for self-harm, the suicide rate falls rapidly and remarkably without affecting agriculture output. Sri Lanka banned Monocrotophos and Methamidophos in 1995 and in the next 20 years there was 70% reduction in all suicides saving around 93,000 lives at a cost of $50 per lives saved. This is one of the most effective public interventions from anywhere in the world. So legislation does work. What are the most toxic pesticides in Nepal?  Dichlorvos and 3g tablets of Aluminium phosphide are the most hazardous pesticides in Nepal and the good news is that both of these have been addressed by the government already, they were recently banned. We are also identifying another toxic compound, a combination of Chlorpyrifos and Cypermethrin. What we have seen from case studies elsewhere is that after each ban something new always comes up but we have also found that they always kill less than those prior pesticides.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 























 






















How can we be sure people won’t go for another method after the ban? Yes, people often argue that pesticide bans don’t work, they will simply do something else. But that something else is often further away. I can walk to a tree to hang myself or to jump off a bridge but by that time I get there I might get bored, meet a friend on the way or get distracted one way of the other. Pesticides have high toxicity because they are hazardous and close by but if you switch to something else it will always be less toxic. And what we have seen in Sri Lanka is that when you ban pesticides, people don’t switch to other things and don’t attempt suicide again because they are not intended to begin with.  But are you not treating a symptom rather than a disease, which is mental illness? Yes I accept that we are not dealing with the cause, but with the symptom but I want people to live. If you don’t live, you can’t see your psychiatrist. And it is not purely mental health. It’s also about culture and communication.  If I have no other way of telling people how angry or upset I am, then I will stand in front of you and drink a bottle of pesticide to tell you how I feel. It is the same in the UK, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The only difference is the lethality of method. So I can’t stop suicide or self-harm as an individual but I can stop people from dying after self-harm, which means they get a chance to seek help if necessary. It’s a concept of harm minimisation, it’s not stopping people from self-harm because it’s difficult to change human behaviour and how people direct their anger and violence towards themselves or other people but we can make it safe.  Which groups are more vulnerable? When we look at the patterns of self-harm, it’s found among young women between 15-20 years of age more than in anybody else. Women are generally sober and take a very small dose of poison. If you get rid of HHPs, these women suicides fall away and that was the case in China and Sri Lanka. Middle-aged men have more deaths because they tend to be intoxicated when they take poison and they take it in a higher dose so even if it’s a less toxic poison, the higher dose is enough to kill them. Suicide is a combination of people harming themselves and lethality of the method.  How has the progress been in Nepal so far? Pesticide suicide in Nepal is comparatively smaller but that is also probably due to the number of bans the government has implemented over the last 15 years. Methyl parathion was a huge problem here in the 1990s and 2000s until it was banned and now there are no cases of suicides using this pesticide. It has been replaced more recently by Dichlorvos but that was also recently banned and will be out of shops in couple of years. There has been a remarkable changes going on here in Nepal to remove the most toxic pesticides and replace them with less hazardous alternatives.  Tell us about your work here in Nepal. What we are trying to do in Nepal is work with our clinical colleagues, Nepal Public Health Foundation and the police laboratories to identify the most problematic pesticides that are killing people in Nepal and once we identify those, we will take that information to the concerned authorities and see how they want to move with that.  Nepal has made a success and has thought about pesticide suicide carefully. What we are doing is bringing the focus on suicide and showing how to get rid of accidental suicides.",/latest,"Sun, 12 Jan 2020 07:22:48 +0000"

 Nepali Times #990
























How ironic, when we destroy something created by man we term it as ‘vandalism’ but when we destroy something created by nature we call it ‘progress’ (‘15 points for and against Nijgad’, #990). Ajay Limbu   The government is set to revise the ratio of compensatory tree plantation from 25:1 to 10:1 for ‘National Pride Projects’. So, the government will be required to plant fewer trees now. Bibek Shrestha   I hope the Nepal Government goes ahead with this project. Even our counterparts in South  and the Southeast Asia have moved ahead and we are still debating on building an airport or not. Just build the damn thing. Bali Hang Sambahangphe   Does Nepal even need Nijgad after completion of Lumbini and Pokhara international airports? Chiran Basnet   Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports are built with regional standards for regional purposes. The Nijgad will be our first truly ‘international airport’. TIA is not even a regional standard airport as per modern requirements. Bibek Limbu   Nijgad airport to become an international hub is most likely the biggest propaganda ever created to justify the irreversible destruction of nature that will affect the entire region. Sanjaya Singh KC   A somewhat madcap project that smacks of extreme hubris. Marcus Cotton   Nijgad is a profoundly bad idea. Now that Pokhara and Bhairawa are nearly operational, Nepal needs to sort out the air traffic situation before taking any more steps. Joe Niemczura   People think that trees never grow once gone, and they would be right if new saplings are not planted. International airport I would say is a must but with minimal damage of the environment. Deepak Rijal   The balance of social, economic and environment is essential for sustainable development. Therefore, it should be built minimising the environmental loss. Anjalee Thakali   The human destruction of nature has crossed the tipping point. So many species are going extinct due to unwarranted development blinded by greed. The next generation will have a huge task undoing our folly. Could we not have smaller international airports at alternative sites? Prabir Rana   Good news. Congratulations. Please avoid all the mistakes of Kathmandu airport at all cost (‘Pokhara: Nepal’s new aviation getaway’, Kunda Dixit, #990). Ramesh Shrestha   This is surely going to be the world’s most beautiful international airport. Sue Chamberlain   It’s absolutely great that some planes/tourists can bypass the air traffic congestion of Kathmandu airport and go directly to Pokhara. Still, bigger planes can’t land in Pokhara (and Bhairawa) and Kathmandu will continue to be the gateway for most tourists flying in to Nepal, and congestion will be worse. Nijgad airport needs to be built. Avani Mani Dixit   A crazy daft idea driven by greed for earnings and with no thought for the pristine environment of the Pokhara and surrounding valleys. Relax by the Fewa or Begnas lakes? Not anymore with jet aircraft blasting overhead. Marc McConnell   If Kathmandu Airport is operated 24 hours and the management is working effectively there is plenty of space for many more flights landing and departing. Stephan Kocher   Nepal needs an international airport close to Kathmandu and Nijgad is the most suited. However, the  environmental impact is also real. If the airport is built, a forest three times larger must be created  elsewhere. This way we have airport with net gain of the forest. As we rely more and more on international air travel, which is rapidly growing, it’s imperative that we are ready for the future. Kathmandu airport doesn’t even meet today’s domestic airport adequate standard when comparing with other countries. There has to be an international airport somewhere in Nepal, which can act like Hub. Roger Adhikari   Yes environment is a big thing to consider here but Nepal doesn’t need a big airport as Nijgad. Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bhairawa should be expanded. The hub model has been replaced by point-to-point aviation, so Nijgad is obsolete.  The Air Asia X long haul low-cost carrier model is a perfect example of which way aviation is going in Asia.

 US airstrike early Friday morning killed Inranian Maj Gen Qassem Soleimani when the missile hit the vehicle outside Bagdad airport. Photo: IRAQI PRIME MINISTER PRESS OFFICE
























As the sabre rattling between the United States and Iran escalates into open tit-for-tat violence, there are fears that a war in the Persian Gulf will, besides causing major death and destruction in the region, will affect South Asian countries like Nepal whose economies are heavily dependent on migrant workers. A new West Asian war could easily suck in regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, as well as other countries in the region allied on either side with them. For example, the UAE, Egypt, are with Saudi Arabia, while Iran, Turkey, Russia and to a certain extent Qatar are sympathetic to Iran.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Economists have said a potential conflict would have worldwide repercussions on energy prices, and cause a domino effect on the economies of South Asia, including Nepal which is among countries most dependent on remittances from the Gulf. Together, South Asian countries have nearly 20 million of their nationals working in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Oman and Bahrain who sent home $131 billion in remittances last year. Nepal alone has 1.5 million of the 4 million of its nationals working abroad in the Gulf region. Simmering tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran escalated this week after Iranian-backed protesters attacked the US Embassy in Baghdad. In retaliation a US airstrike early Friday morning killed Maj Gen Qassem Soleimani, a prominent Iranian general in Baghdad who belongs to the Revolutionary Guard.  Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of a militia in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces and five others were also killed.  Soleimani was a key figure in Iran’s military presence in Iraq, Syria and Yemen and has been seen as a charismatic figure. Militia that he backed have attacked US forces in Iraq and Syria for the past decade. Iran warned that it would respond and a “harsh retaliation is waiting”.   Tensions have been high in the Strait of Hormuz through which most of the world’s oil import passes after two oil tankers were attacked in May and set on fire and an airport attacked. The Saudis immediately blamed Iran and the Houthi rebels in Yemen that it backs. The Houthis were also blamed for a missle attack on an Aramco refinery in Saudi Arabia in November. One of the ships attacked in May was the Japanese tanker Kokuka Courageous, which was struck even as Iranian leader was meeting Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Teheran. The United States is already involved in the region, with its navy including aircraft carrier Dwight D Eisenhower patrolling the strategic Straits of Hormuz. Washington has sided with Saudi Arabia in the conflict, and has been piling pressure on Iran with international sanctions. West Asia has been polarised by the dispute, with the UAE and Israel taking Saudi Arabia’s side against Iran, while Qatar which is still being blockaded by Saudi Arabia and the UAE being much more sympathetic to Iran.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Qatar is the country with the highest number of Nepalis, with nearly 600,000 workers. Saudi Arabia has 350,000 Nepalis, and the rest are scattered in other Gulf countries. If open hostilities did break out between Saudi Arabia and its allies against Iran, Nepal would be hit indirectly by soaring oil prices. The government raised oil prices on new year’s day in Nepal, as global prices went up with tensions rising in the Gulf. Nepal spent Rs131 billion last year in petroleum imports from the Gulf via Indian refineries, and the amount doubled in the last five years. More than 15% of Nepal’s total import bill is made up by petroleum which is sourced in the Gulf. However, experts say, South Asian economies will be hit much more directly if remittances take fall due to a future conflict. Of the South Asian countries, Nepal is the most dependent on remittances with the $6.5 billion it earns annually from overseas workers coming mostly from the Gulf. Remittances are worth 31% of Nepal’s GDP, the highest proportion in the world – even higher than labour exporting countries like Kyrgyzsan and Haiti. Remittances to South Asian countries from the Gulf region grew 12% in 2018, double the growth rate for the previous year, according to the World Bank. Remittances to India alone grew by 14%, while Bangladesh saw an increase of 15%. There has been an increase of numbers going to Qatar in the past year as the country prepares for the 2022 World Cup, as well as an increased demand for dairy and agriculture workers as Qatar has tried to be more self-sufficient in food production after the Saudi-led blockade two years ago. However, the number of Nepalis going abroad has gone down in the past year, mainly as a result of the freeze on workers to Malaysia because of delays in implementing a new bilateral labour deal between the two countries. Any conflict in the Gulf would also directly affect tourism as Nepal prepares to welcome 2 million tourists in Visit Nepal Year 2020. All the air routes to Nepal from the west pass through the Gulf region, and these links have already been affected by other tensions: the closure of India-Pakistan air space for through flights, and flights to and from Qatar having to fly over Iran to bypass the Saudi-UAE blockade.",/latest,"Fri, 03 Jan 2020 11:30:28 +0000"

Having spent all her money waiting at a lodge near the airfield in Jufal, Gurung has now decided to return to her home in Saldang. But she may not be able to make it back home either because heavy snow has covered the high passes.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Nepal’s mountains and the trans-Himalayan districts of Mugu, Dolpo, Mustang and Manang experienced snow much earlier than usual in December, and another heavy snowfall now. It has caught many local people unprepared. 
























 Dolpo’s stunning Phoksundo Lake in winter.
























Usually, the people of Upper Dolpo like Tsamcho Gurung travel to the lower valleys for the winter. But this year, since the snow came early, many have been stranded. Karma Dolma and her parents are planning to spend the winter in Kathmandu going on a pilgrimage to Buddhist shrines like Bodhnath, and while there get a health checkup. Dolma made it across the Kangla and Shey-La passes withi great difficulty in waist-high snow only to find out in Jufal that there have been no flights because of bad weather. “Crossing the passes is easier than waiting here at the airport,” Doplma says. “The uncertainty is killing us. We could try to hire a jeep, but it takes several days and the roads are treacherous.” 























 






















Aishwarya Rokaya has a Tara Air ticket to Nepalganj where she needs to get admitted to hospital for a stomach ailment, but says she has had enough of waiting. “If the plane doesn’t come tomorrow we have no choice but to go back home day there is not flight. What to do. I am sure the pain will get worse.” Students from Crystal Mountain School in Dho walked for four days across snowbound passes to get to the airport, and have now been waiting for three days. This is the annual winter migration of people from Upper Dolpo, and the children use the winter break to descend to warmer climes. 























 






















At the airline counter in the airport, there is a chaos every morning with no information from airline staff. Passengers on mobiles try to contact relatives in Nepalganj to ask about the weather and if the plane has taken off. “The weather is unpredictable here in Dolpo, but we cannot control the clouds,” says the Tara Air manager here. “If it clears up we can make up to two flights, but there is a big backlog of people who have been waiting for many days.” 























 











 


















 Jufal airfield snowed in.
























Dolpo is served only by Tara and Sita Air, and both airlines have not operated here for nearly a week now. The shortage of flights means there is a thriving black market in tickets, and distributors who own lodges give priority for their guests by asking for an extra fee. The last flight out from Jufal airfield in Dolpo was on 29 December. With heavy snowfall on Friday, it is unlikely flights will resume any time soon.",/latest,"Fri, 03 Jan 2020 09:25:20 +0000"

On 31 December Malaysia’s amnesty program for migrant workers called ‘Back for Good’ (B4G) came to an end. By paying RM700 ($170) and tickets back home, the scheme gave undocumented migrant workers an opportunity to return home without facing the penalty of up to RM10,000 ($2,500) for overstaying, and imprisonment of up to five years. Over 17,000 raids were conducted in 2019 alone, and many Nepali workers were caught up in the dragnet. Nepalis become undocumented despite being aware of the risks and consequences of getting caught, and some employers are equally involved in the process, but get away with little consequence.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “What was different this time was the proactive role played by the Nepal embassy in Kuala Lumpur,” said Dinesh, a Nepali worker living in Malaysia for a decade. “They made sure fraudulent agents were not involved in the processing to assist those who wanted to benefit from the program.”   An employer has to jump through hoops to obtain an approval to hire a foreign worker. A recent World Bank report details a lengthy ten step process involving multiple visits to Malaysian ministries and payment of levy, insurance policy, security bond etc to hire a worker. There are also formalities on the Nepali side including demand letter verification and labour approvals. Alternately, employers can easily poach migrant workers in Malaysia by simply providing a salary premium and avoiding time and financial fees associated with recruitment, and formal costs such as insurance and levies. 























 






















Undocumented workers are easier to hire, abuse or fire as they do not have any power to report misconduct. Many workers who are victims of abuse or breach of contract opt to move to the irregular status because there is no option to legally change employers. Many overstay their visas given that a few months of the initial contract are simply spent repaying the recruitment costs that brought them there. Others simply want more freedom, higher income and more hours of work with multiple employers.  This can seem like a win-win situation for both until they are caught. In such cases, however, the worker is disproportionately punished. “Employers can easily bribe their way out of the fines and imprisonment they are liable to for hiring an undocumented worker,” says Dinesh.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Experts say a more comprehensive study on the factors driving millions of foreign workers and thousands of Malaysian employers to opt for irregular hiring can benefit both the sending and receiving countries. Bans and amnesties only scratch the surface of deeper structural issues that drive both employers and workers to opt for irregular channels in the first place. The World Bank estimates that there are over 1.2 million irregular migrants in Malaysia, so the 187,000 foreign nationals opting the B4G program including 5,900 Nepalis points to how many decided to remain despite the appeal of the program and the heightened risks of apprehensions. “I have Nepali friends who chose to remain back despite the risks because they are earning well. They live outside the raid-prone areas and feel relatively safer. They are positive that another Amnesty Program will be arranged by the Malaysian Government, by when they will have saved money,” says another Nepali worker. With flights to Kathmandu filled with workers returning from Malaysia, the spotlight is also on migration stakeholders in Nepal. Nepal needs to focus on its reintegration policy, our own ‘Back for Good’ program that does not have the same negative and unwelcoming connotation as Malaysia’s. Nationalisation policies of Gulf countries have also partially or entirely banned sectors for foreign workers, the finishing up of FIFA related construction projects in Qatar and the geopolitics in the region means more and more Nepali migrants are coming home. The image of the thousands of workers leaving the country gets all the attention in the mainstream press, but on the other side of the airport are Nepalis returning home who are not noticed.",/latest,"Thu, 02 Jan 2020 07:06:01 +0000"

 India Airlines Airbus300 that was hijacked on 24 December 1999 at Afghanistan’s Kandahar airport.
























The world was waiting with bated breath for all kinds of catastrophes to befall humanity as the decade of the 90s, the century of the 1900s, and the millennium drew to a close. But there was a different kind of disaster in store in Kathmandu. It was on Christmas Eve of 24 December 1999, and an Airbus300 of Indian  Airlines had just taken off from Kathmandu for New Delhi.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Twenty minutes into the flight five gunmen stormed the cockpit and forced the plane to divert first to Amritsar. It was refused landing in Lahore by turning off runway lights, then to Dubai, and on to Kandahar in Afghanistan. The gunmen demanded the release of fellow-militants, including Maulana Masood Azhar, in an Indian jail.  Read also: Hijack diary Among the 171 passengers was Sanjay Dhital, who had just got married to Rosina, and worked with Afghan refugees for AMDA (Association of Medical Doctor of Asia) based in Peshawar in Pakistan and ran clinics in Afghanistan. The couple spent eight harrowing days inside the plane, not knowing whether they would get out of the ordeal alive. “The worst part of life is the long wait to die,” Dhital recalls, 20 years later in his Bhaisepati home where he lives with his parents, wife and two children. “But time heals, and many of the details get blurred with the passage of the years.” However, he does remember a few things he had not revealed during his first interview with Nepali Times on the first anniversary of the hijacking in 2000. He had come to Nepal on a month’s leave to get married, and the newly married couple were going to fly out on Pakistan International Airlines. But due to the new year rush they did not get ticket, so the travel agent routed them to Peshawar via Delhi and Lahore. 























 






















“There were many other Indian honeymooners on the flight,” Dhital remembers, “The flight attendants had just started serving food when someone shouted ‘head down, don’t move’. There was commotion on the plane.” There were masked men with knives and pistols threatening passengers in English and Hindi. The pilot then announced that the plane was being hijacked. Night fell, and the passengers felt the plane circling, landing and taking off, they did not know they were already in Kandahar. The hijackers announced that they were Kashmiris, and if the Indian government did not release their friends, they would kill all the passengers one by one. But passengers were relieved to hear that a UN team was flying in from Islamabad to negotiate. “One of the passengers was a large man named Gajendra Tamrakar, and the hijackers would make him imitate Bollywood hero Amjad Khan, and make us all laugh, and we would for a moment forget our own predicament,” Dhital remembers.

The negotiations failed, and the hijackers asked all passengers to raise their hands for their last meal because they were all going to be killed. No one raised their hand, Dhital recalls, only Tamrakar did, and he ate an entire chicken. A Japanese passenger was so stressed she kept smoking and taking pictures, and the hijackers confiscated all cameras. Dhital went to the business class area to deposit his camera, when the hijackers found Pakistani money in his bag. They asked him if he was Pakistani, and when they found out he had an Afghan visa, he was taken to the head hijacker in the cockpit. Dhital’s wife was convinced he was being led off to be executed, and started crying. But all the hijacker wanted to do was to talk to him, and thank him for his service in Pakistan. He told his comrades to treat the Nepali passenger well.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Human beings can go without food, but they cannot do without water. We were always thirsty in the plane. Fellow passengers would ask me what I would do once I was released, and I remember thinking I will drink an entire bottle of water,” Dhital says. The five hijackers all had code names: Manager, Shankar, Bhola, Burger and Doctor. Of the lot, Doctor seemed the nicest, but his job was to lecture to us about the inevitability of death, and to be prepared for it. On the seventh day, there was panic. The hijackers went through the cabin and said the talks had failed and the Indian government did not want to save the lives of their nationals on board. “We will now start executing you one by one, no one should cry, just take Allah’s name,” he said. Two of the hijackers appeared with AK-47s. Dhital wondered whether they would start killing the passengers from the front or back, and when their turn would come because they were in the middle. The newly-wed couple hugged each other and wept, waiting for certain death. The hijackers stabbed an Indian passenger with a knife.

But soon, it was announced that the talks had been successful, and the passengers were to be released. The hijackers asked for forgiveness. They also asked for a memento and passengers raised Rs71,000 for a model of an Airbus300, and Dhital was asked to donate the rest to the hospital in Kandahar. The couple returned to Kathmandu with the other Nepali passengers to a tumultuous welcome. After two weeks the couple flew on PIA to Peshawar, and Dhital had a model of an Airbus made in Lahore  and gave it to his staff to pass it on to the Taliban, and he gave the Rs23,000 to the Peshawar Hospital.    “I am often asked what did it feellike. I cannot put it in words, you have to live it yourself to know,” says Dhital, who is now 52 and his wife is 41. “I was convinced we were not going to make it out alive. But the experience made me less selfish, less ambitious. After that I decided to return to Nepal and work here.”",/latest,"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 13:39:00 +0000"

It is the biggest amount granted to Nepal for a specific project by a bilateral development partner. But the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) project has become the centre of a row between two factions of the Nepal Communist Party, and stalled proceedings at the Central Committee meeting of the ruling party last week, raising questions about Nepal’s credibility. The major chunk of the grant is supposed to be spent on the Kathmandu-Hetauda-Butwal 400KVa transmission line which will eventually evacuate electricity generated from hydropower plants on the Budi Gandaki, Trisuli, Kali Gandaki, Marsyangdi, Kosi, and Tamakosi corridors. Another component will go for upgrading key highways. Read also: A millennium challenge, Editorial Hitendradev Shakya, a transmission line specialist says this power link will form the backbone of Nepal’s national grid. “It is imperative that Nepal starts building this, with or without American aid,” he says.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Hydropower projects that will produce a total of 330MW power are under construction in Rasuwa and Nuwakot on the Bhote Kosi, and a further 500MW of electricity will come from schemes under construction. Transmission lines for 220KVa have already been built to feed the power to Kathmandu Valley, but these will only serve power plants under construction. More transmission lines will be needed for future power plants, and also for possible export to India. If not, electricity generated, especially during the monsoon, could go waste. The Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) has already made Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) to buy about 6,000MW of electricity from private operators, but the transmission lines to distribute it are lagging behind. NEA wants another transmission link to bring power from plants on the Tama Kosi to Kathmandu and to eastern Nepal via Hetauda, and export the surplus to India through Butwal. Read also: Nepal in 2030, Sanghamitra Subba However, at the NCP Central Committee last week there was intense debate between those for and against the MCC. Some prominent leaders like Bhim Rawal, Deb Gurung and Yogesh Bhattarai objected to the MCC on grounds that it was a part of the US Indo-Pacific Strategy that they see as being directed against China. The meeting could not come to an agreement, and decision on it was passed to the party secretariat. Some said the sabre rattling in the Central Committee was just populist posturing to appear nationalist. The MCC was established in 2004 by the US Congress to help developing nations reduce poverty through financial aid. In August 2017, the MCC Board in the US approved a $500 million grant to Nepal to improve Nepal’s energy and road infrastructure. Experts say that arguing about a bilateral project already agreed upon could raise questions about Nepal’s credibility in the international arena. Whether or not MCC is a part of America’s Indo-Pacific Strategy is an old debate, and Minister for Foreign Affairs Pradeep Gyawali has maintained it is not. He visited Washington DC last year and met Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to push the project forward.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Either the leaders should give alternatives, or stop objecting to this grant,” says economist Biswa Poudel. This year several high-profile American officials have visited Nepal, including the Indo-Pacific Commander Philip A Davidson, Deputy Assistant Secretary Joseph Felter, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia David J Ranz. The visits have bolstered the view that the MCC is indeed a US move to counter China’s Belt Road Initiative in Nepal. In fact Ranz actually admitted to the Nepali media that it was. Read also: Nepal now has to balance not just India and China, but also the West, Bhairaja Panday Last June, a report by the American Department of Defence identified the Indo-Pacific Strategy as a military move to project American power in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and a pillar of American foreign policy in the region. However, international relations expert Tika Dhakal believes the MCC should be separated from American military strategy: “It is not beneficial for Nepal to be a part of the military gameplan of a foreign power, and America should not include MCC under its Indo-Pacific strategy.”  The other sensitivity to Nepal is that the transmission line link to India could make Nepal even more dependent on its southern neighbour. “No aid comes without strings attached. But the Nepal government should be clever enough to use aid like this for its own benefit,” Dhakal says.   Another controversy surrounds a clause in the agreement that the project must be ratified by Nepal’s Parliament. The Cabinet had planned to table it in the House last year, but ex-Speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara did not include it in the list of subjects, allegedly on purpose. Khadga Bahadur Bista of Millennium Challenge Nepal Development Committee says that if it is not approved in the ongoing winter session of Parliament, the project may be dropped. “It is due to start end-June 2020. If Parliament does not approve it now, it will be difficult to stick to that date.” Even those in favour of the MCC say Nepal should not have accepted the clause about Parliament ratification. The other sticking point may be to get India’s prior approval for the 400KVa transmission line. The MCC Compact states that if the project is not finished in five years, the money goes back to the US treasury, and the delays could scuttle the project.",/latest,"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 12:09:09 +0000"

When asked how he balances writing about Kathmandu while living abroad, Samrat Upadhyay asks: “What do we mean by authenticity? According to whom?” “I come here often enough,” he says. “I did spend my formative years here. I understand the ubiquitous Nepali character, if there is one. Authenticity is such a curious term that implies there is like this one Nepali culture.”      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Upadhyay arrives at Himalayan Java in Thamel for the interview nursing a cold, a day after an award ceremony for a short story contest of La.Lit magazine, where Upadhyay was the sole judge. Popularly known as the first Nepali-born writer to be published in the United States, Upadhyay is Nepal’s most accomplished English language novelist, with seven books and various accolades. When Upadhyay started out, there were few people in Nepal writing in English. “There was no sense of community. There was nothing like La.Lit or Quixote’s Cove.” Now, he says, there are not just more people writing, but more people serious about writing – going on retreats, winning fellowships and getting published both here and abroad. We circle back to his depiction of Nepal and if he is afraid of missing something when he is away. “I don’t mean to say I don’t need to keep up at all, as if Nepal has remained ossified,” he adds, “but I am also not walking around with some mental diary saying ‘Okay, let me figure out what has changed and what has not.’ I just absorb things.” 
























 Books by Samrat Upadhyay
























Like many others who write about their home countries in English, Upadhyay is often criticised for catering to a western audience. His writing has also been characterised as one that injects sex where it doesn’t belong, with readers falling on both sides of the critique. For his part, Upadhyay seems more concerned about pushing past what is publicly shunned in what he considers traditional culture. He says La.Lit’s Writing Nepal 2019 shortlist had two stories that explicitly explored sexual boundaries: “People are becoming braver and bolder, expanding the notion of what it means to be Nepali.”      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Transcending language is an issue too. Writers try to overcome the barrier in their own way, whether it’s by publishing an entire chapter in their native script or by approximating their language’s syntax quite literally into English. “That’s the craft of writing for those of us who write in English about a landscape where the majority of the people are not speaking English constantly,” Upadhyay says. “It is kind of a judicious thing you do. I believe language is fairly malleable.” It may depend on your command over your language, but it also speaks to who your intended readership is. Upadhyay waves off pages of Nepali dialogue with footnotes (‘It’s so passé’) describing it as something that will not reach a wider audience. On the other hand, he does not have his work translated into Nepali – although he has received, and rejected, samples by other people, yet found his own attempt at translating to take too long.   “I thought, ‘Do I want to spend like two years translating my own work or do I want to spend two years writing a new novel? Which would be more pleasurable for me?’ The answer was obvious.” His latest novel? “It’s still a work in progress,” says Samrat Upadhyay, “I am working on, I guess you could call it some type of a dystopian novel set in Nepal … Not full fantasy. It has strange moments, which I have enjoyed writing.”",/latest,"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 09:06:59 +0000"

Anubhav Nayyar is the Asia-Pacific Senior Director of Viber, one of the most popular communication apps in Nepal. Nepali Times spoke to him this week about Viber’s growth, its privacy policy and future plans. Nepali Times: What makes Viber so popular in Nepal? Anubhav Nayyar: If you look at all players, product wise, we are very similar. We have tried to cater our product and services to the emerging markets like Nepal where there are certain challenges … countries just a little behind the curve, where internet infrastructure is not that great. It is important to have hygiene services that are really good.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); I am very proud to say Viber has not had any downtime throughout the last couple of years unlike every other competitor. The biggest differentiator is the fact that we choose to focus on Nepal. That is what sets us apart. I have not seen many localised initiatives from other players. It is an important market for us, we have a high usage over here. We are the only app which is truly localised from a global perspective. We are evaluating localised UI (user interface) itself because there are a lot of people who would not be English-literate so then can we offer a service that is completely translatable. I do not mean a Google translate that is very literal, but actually translated in a way that people can understand.

In 2019 we grew in excess of 20% of our base and it is a big base here. What is very encouraging is that our growth is through communication and group communication. We have a couple of media partnerships such as with Online Khabar that have been doing really well. We have also decided to partner with HamroPatro to provide a horoscope to every Viber user who chooses to subscribe to this service. We have also partnered with Nepal Mediciti Hospital so users can request for an ambulance or any assistance through Viber. We take that as a responsibility. In the beginning of this year we hit a billion users across the world – a big landmark and a proud moment for all of us. We should be breaking even, a big landmark for a messaging communication platform that is completely free. How do you ensure user data protection?  We are very passionate about user privacy. What sets us apart from our competition over here is that we are end-to-end encrypted by default. That is very important. The moment a message is sent from a mobile device, it gets encrypted and only the receiver’s phone can decode it. There are a lot of apps which will claim to be end-to-end encrypted, but you have to go into settings, find it and switch it on. We take user privacy very strongly. People do not want their intimate personal conversations out there in public, and that is the basic issue some of the major players have seen. Privacy is a birth right. To put it bluntly: we do not sell our user data to make money and it is a compromise we make. We are asked by advertisers and we lose those dollars, but we gain consumer trust. Viber has some things planned for VisitNepal2020? It is very important initiative for the country and the government has put numbers behind it so we will be trying to help.

Nepal’s future may not be in hydropower, as most assume, but actually in the dung heap. A new industrial-scale biogas plant near Pokhara has proved that livestock and farm waste producing flammable methane gas can replace imported LPG and chemical fertiliser.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Over the past 30 years, Nepal has become a world leader in spreading locally-designed household biogas digesters. There are now 300,000 of them, helping reduce deforestation, improving people’s health and lifting women out of drudgery and poverty. Now, a company in Pokhara has enlarged household digesters into an industrial scale plant that uses climate-friendly technology that could ultimately be scaled  nationwide to reduce Nepal’s balance of trade gap.  Read also: Father of Nepal’s gobar gas industry, David McConkey Mustering up energy to face the future, Om Astha Rai Kushal Gurung’s grandfather was in the British Army, and he also applied for recruitment but failed the eyesight test. So, he set up Gandaki Urja in Pokhara that works with wind, solar and hydropower, but he believes Nepal’s best option for sustainable growth lies in energy from waste. “Nepal must abandon fossil fuels, but even among renewable energy sources biogas has a three-fold advantage. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and is therefore climate friendly. It allows us to manage raw waste. And it can slash our import bill for LPG and chemical fertiliser,” says Gurung. “It is a win-win-win.” 























 






















A tipper truck has just arrived from Gorkha at Gandaki Urja’s biogas plant at Kotre near Pokhara, which with its dome digester looks like a nuclear reactor. The truck tilts its container to empty 5 tons of smelly poultry waste into a pit where rotting vegetables and cow dung from a farm in Syangja are all being mixed before being fed into the 4,000 cubic meter digester that is kept inflated. In the absence of oxygen, bacteria already in the cow dung go to work to break down the waste into methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. The impurities are removed by filters to produce 200 cylinders of bio-CNG a day which are sold to big hotels and restaurants in Pokhara. Read also: No smoke without fire, Ajaya Dixit No alternative to alternative energy, Bhrikuti Rai Customers pay a deposit for the cylinders and pressure regulators, and usually use up about two cylinders a day. The cost per kg for the bio-Compressed Natural Gas (bio-CNG) is the same as the state subsidised Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG). However, customers prefer the biogas because it saves them up to 30% cost because it has higher calorific value than LPG, and there is no residue that goes waste.  “So far, the customers are satisfied, and we see demand growing in the future as word spreads,” says Ashim Kayastha, Director of Gandaki Urja. Half the plant’s revenue comes from bio-CNG and the other half from the effluent which is dried and sold as organic fertiliser. The plant can produce up to 11,000 tons of fertiliser a year and is sold to surrounding farms.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The future of bio-CNG depends on scaling up the technology since any municipality generating more than 40 tons of biodegradable waste per day could have its own biogas plant. Nepal imports 500,000 tons of chemical fertiliser a year, and if each of 100 municipalities produced 5,000 tons of organic fertiliser Nepal could slash its import bill. Read also: An energy windfall for Nepal?, Kushal Gurung Nepal turns to solar and batteries to meet peak demand, Kunda Dixit 























 






















This could also significantly reduce the country’s annual import of Rs33 billion worth of LPG from India which grew four-fold in the past 10 years, making up 2.5% of Nepal’s total import bill. But to scale up, industrial biogas needs the same government incentives as hydro, solar and wind power. At the moment hydropower investors enjoy a 100% corporate tax holiday for 10 years, and 50% for the next five years. There is only 1% tax on imports of equipment for solar, wind and hydropower, there is no such provision for the equipment for industrial scale biogas. Instead, there is a tax on interest, and also VAT on bio-CNG. “The government should look at this not only as an energy project, but at its multifaceted benefits,” says Kushal Gurung of Gandaki Urja. “There is a waste-to-energy and fertiliser angle, too. If we want to make Nepal fully organic in the next ten years, projects like these need to be prioritised.” Gandaki Urja got a boost from an unlikely source, Business Oxygen (BO2) in Kathmandu which helps entrepreneurs running Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to scale up by injecting equity and providing technical assistance. Read also: Putting wind in the map, Kushal Gurung Climate risk to hydropower investment, Ajaya Dixit Says Siddhant Pandey of BO2: “We are always on the lookout for climate investments, and we realised that bio-CNG would be an incredible adaptive resilience investment. It would displace imports of LPG and fertiliser. It was going to be clean, no carbon footprint, and it made business sense because it met our internal return on investment expectation.” The challenges are ensuring reliable sources of raw material and building knowhow for the technology within Nepal. Says Pandey: “The Pokhara plant is a drop in the ocean, it can abe replicated in all 7 provinces. We know it is scalable, and it depends how proactive provincial governments will be.”",/multimedia,"Thu, 02 Jan 2020 09:46:34 +0000"

 Planting bamboo and napier grass on embankments and sugarcane on riverbanks binds the soil and prevents flood damage.
























Most research about climate impact in the Himalaya deals with receding snowlines and retreating glaciers.

Damage from floods caused by extreme weather is exacerbated by encroachment on floodplains and road embankments that block natural drainage channels.   “Unlike in the past, when we used to have gentle showers every other day during monsoon, nowadays it does not rain for weeks and when it does, it comes down in destructive torrents,” says Bal Sugriv Rana of Shuklaphanta municipality in Kanchanpur. He points above his head to indicate the level that water reached in the great flood 11 years ago that forced farmers to abandon the village.

Farmers have now returned to the village and are not waiting for government help, but taking their own measures to reduce the threat of future floods. With support from global humanitarian organisation Mercy Corps under its program Managing Risk Through Economic Development (M-RED), farmers like Rana in Kailali and Kanchanpur districts have reduced the risk of floods by planting bamboo and napier grass on embankments and sugarcane on riverbanks. Not only are they now better protected from future floods, the new crops are earning them important income. Mercy Corps is also a member of the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance, a global partnership which works to increase flood resilience throughout the world, including in Nepal.  Sugarcane is so resilient it can grow in sandy floodplains, where its stem and roots can reduce water’s velocity and destructive force. The sugarcane plant can also survive for up to 10 days when flooding occurs.  “They said I was crazy when I planted sugarcane in the sand, but it has reduced the severity of floods, the riverbanks are not barren anymore and we earn money with relatively little investment from the sale of the cane to the sugar factory,” explains Mangal Prasad Chaudhary of the village disaster management committee.

In the nearby village of Tikili of Kanchanpur, villagers also plant pumpkin, watermelon, banana, squash and gourd after floods recede – taking advantage of nutrients deposited by flood waters — which adds to their income. This has discouraged open cattle grazing, which in turn helps the vegetation to grow back and provide an additional layer of protection from the floods. Now that the river has been tamed by barriers of gabion walls, sugarcane, bamboo and elephant grass, the land is secure enough to plant paddy, vegetables and other cash crops. “We earn an extra Rs50,000 per year selling bananas, which has been quite helpful in running the household,” says Rajudevi Rana, 40, as she picks clusters of the ripening fruit from her family plot near the river. Most of the rain in Nepal falls in the three monsoon months from July-September, and the rivers are dry rest of the year. The climate crisis has made the problem of too much or too little water worse, but with the help of development organisations, farmers have learnt to adapt to the new weather pattern. “We did a lot of research to come up with the solution of combining flood risk reduction with income generation,” explains Saroj Kumar Thakur of Mercy Corps Nepal in Kanchanpur. “This is now a working model that can be replicated in other parts of the Tarai suffering flood risk.” Read also:  Food and flood, Sunir Pandey      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Border wall, Kanak Mani Dixit

Indeed, the Kanchanpur success story can easily be upscaled in flood prone districts like Rautahat, Sarlahi and Mahottari, which faced devastating floods in the recent years. The success of sugarcane, banana and vegetable plantations has even persuaded young farmers who had planned to go to the Gulf or Malaysia for work to change their minds. For Mayor Dil Bahadur Ayer of Shuklaphanta, this is a success story that his municipality can be proud of.  Read also: Migrant worker finds farming in Nepal more rewarding, Naresh Newar “Motivated farmers with the help of experts have managed to reduce the risk of floods by themselves — they have achieved what the government could not,” he said. “Now we need to copy this elsewhere in Nepal by involving all three levels of government.”   Ayer is also committed to tighten restrictions on illegal sand mining upstream, which threatens to undermine the accomplishment of the villagers in reducing flood risk. Bhesh Parajuli of Mercy Corps says local governments are not allocating required resources for disaster risk reduction, spending most of their budget on infrastructure. He adds: “But even infrastructure needs to be disaster-resistant. With federalism, we now have to develop skills at local levels to respond to the floods.” 























 



































Back to the land 

















 Gayadin Chaudhay points to the level of water during the 2008 flooding in Kailali.
























Harvest time is a busy period in Lalitpur, a farming village at the Indian border in Kailali district. Women harvest paddy, men load sacks of rice for the market in Dhangadi, children on holiday from school tend ducks by the river, while goats and cows graze lazily on the stubble.  Looking at it today, it is hard to imagine that Lalitpur village was once completely abandoned. Families had to flee for their lives in 2008, abandoning their homes and farms when the river burst its banks. They did not return for 10 years.   Read also: Dancing with the river, Ramesh Bhusal “It was a like a sea. The flood started in the morning and continued until midnight and later — it rained all night. There was so much water. I went back and forth on a boat rescuing the children and women,” recalls Gayadin Chaudhari, who was 30 at the time. The Tharu people here are used to floods, and have learnt to live with them. But the 2008 disaster was like nothing they had seen before. A wall of water nearly 2m high suddenly entered the settlement — many lost their loved ones. Homes were washed away, food destroyed, livestock drowned and water sources were contaminated. The farms were covered in sand and silt, forcing villagers to relocate. 
























 A farmer tends to his vegetable patch near the river.
























Now, the farmers have returned and they are determined to prevent a similar in the future. Supported by Mercy Corps Nepal and the Nepal Red Cross, they plant crops along the riverbanks that both help prevent flooding and have good commercial value, including bamboo, sugarcane and napier grass. Villagers are organised in a commune and plant and harvest sugarcane together, pooling the profits from the collectively-owned fields.    “There will be floods in future, but they will not be able to affect us as much as before because of the bio-engineering of the embankment,” says Chaudhary, whose family is among 22 that have returned to Lalitpur. But just in case, the village also has an early warning system. A monitoring station upstream circulates an SMS warning when the river water crosses a danger mark. Chaudhary’s share of the profits from the sugarcane and vegetables is now over Rs150,000 annually. Over the years the commune has used its profits to buy farm equipment, including a tractor, a power tiller, disc plough and a thresher. “This is a community that has successfully bounced back from disaster. The farmers live here without fear,” says Saroj Kumar Thakur of Mercy Corps Nepal. “We now want to build the capacity of the villagers so that they can manage on their own after the project ends, not just with floods but also other risks like wild elephant attacks and disease.” Sonia Awale in Kailali",/multimedia,"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 07:52:46 +0000"

For those who think that Nepal is too underdeveloped to make full use of artificial intelligence (AI), think again. That is exactly what they used to say about computers and mobile phones in the 1990s.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); It may come as a surprise to many that Nepal has been gaining ground in AI, developing not only software using machine learning algorithms but producing world-class engineers. One company at the forefront is Fusemachines Nepal, which has started using industry experts to train AI students with cutting-edge technology to deliver intelligent solutions. “I wanted to see if I can contribute in bringing the best AI education to Nepal and make Nepal known around the world as one of the best sources of AI talent,” says the Nepali founder of Fusemachines, Sameer Maskey, a professor at Columbia University.

Fusemachines Director of Academic Affairs Bülent Uyaniker, who was in Nepal recently, rejects the notion that Nepal is not ready for artificial intelligence applications. “It is happening already, it is inevitable. If there can be 8.5 million Facebook users in Nepal, then it has the special conditions for AI.”   Proof of this is the increasing number of software companies in Nepal using local engineering talent to work on software solutions for customers in North America or Europe. However, most of the engineers and recent graduates need training in AI to keep up with customer requirements. America alone will need 200,000 data scientists in the next five years, and most of these will come from the UK, Finland, Canada, Singapore, China and India.     Which is why Fusemachines Nepal is also emphasising education. Says the head of its global operations and strategy, Sumana Shrestha: “You cannot learn AI in a one-day bootcamp, it needs intelligent mathematics, but there is a huge demand versus supply gap for engineers proficient in machine learning or other AI components everywhere.”

Recently, a group of engineering students developed a model to help poultry entrepreneurs understand fowl behaviour and the state of their animals’ health, helping them to raise the farm’s business profile. “With precision livestock farming we can generate patterns to help farmers recognise symptoms before an outbreak of a disease by implementing AI components such as image processing and deep learning,” explained engineering student Sajil Awale at Pulchok Engineering Campus. “This allows for timely intervention to prevent mass deaths and reduce losses.”   Read also: Tap and tour, Clara Bullock Computer vision (which enables computers to see and process images as humans would) can also help identify rotten fruit swiftly, and prevent misuse of pesticides by identifying areas on the farm that require chemicals, and the amounts needed.

Engineers at Fusemachines Nepal are working on Nepal’s first optical character recognition (OCR) system so forms filled out with Nepali handwriting can be digitised and translated into English. This will have huge scope in Nepal’s banking, hospital and government sectors, where pen and paper continues to be the norm. Sixit Bhatta, CEO of ride-sharing startup Tootle, says Nepal is ripe for AI applications: “Our efforts now should be on preparing for a world in which machines perform skills-oriented tasks and for humans to take on the roles that require creativity and empathy. But before that, the government should design policies that allow AI to grow, and not restrict it.”      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Sumana Shrestha at Fusemachines Nepal says that as long as salaries for clerical staff are low, there is less potential for AI to flourish. But she adds: “The curse of cheap labour means companies will prefer to employ people to do repetitive work. But sooner or later, AI will be here. Nepal needs to develop despite government. And the private sector needs to prepare itself for disruption.”

Making Nepalis artificially intelligent
 

















 FUSION ENERGY: Head of global operations and strategy at Fusemachnes Nepal Sumana Shrestha (centre) with senior machine learning engineer Rojesh Shikharkar and staff Sunij Shrestha at the Kamaladi office on Wednesday. 
























During a visit to Nepal six years ago, Columbia University professor Sameer Maskey handpicked three students from engineering schools across Kathmandu who were able to solve a mathematical equation. The three went on to become the core of Fusemachines, a global company that aims to democratise artificial intelligence (AI) through education and software solutions. Headquartered in New York, Fusemachines has since opened branches in Canada, UK and the Dominican Republic to develop intelligent software solutions that have transformed brands and businesses around the world. One of its biggest operations is in Nepal, Fusemachines employs 100 top Nepali software engineers who work on projects that use AI applications in fields ranging from telecommunications and banking to hospitals and governance. Unlike other back office companies that work on outsourced software development, Fusemachines is a school in itself, training engineers while coming up with product solutions. “We employ senior engineers and industry experts with PhDs along with upcoming engineers, who work together to solve client-specific problems though AI,” explains Sumana Shrestha who heads Fusemachines’ global operations and strategy. “Such collaborative approach allows young talent to continuously learn and grow.”  Following Maskey’s vision, Fusemachines tries to make AI accessible to everyone through education, which is why it initially offered training fellowships and then, to meet the demand for engineers, launched AI Shikshya — a year-long, in-house training program. “With our own proprietary platform and content we have partnered with engineering colleges in Kathmandu to offer AI,” says Shrestha. “The program is a blend of online and on-site, the course material is not too academic, is industry focused and instructors are seasoned engineers up to date with new algorithms.” The company also has its own AI schools, open to professionals who want to grow their business or anyone interested. Fusemachines also offers a foundation course, open to high school graduates. A year-long, micro-degree program consisting of four major courses — including machine learning, deep thinking, natural language processing and computer vision — will be the next step. “In school we were always presented with clean data sets to work on but that is rarely the case on the job. But this year-long training program gets people ready to take on real-life problems and provide AI solutions,” says Rojesh Shikharkar, engineer at Fusemachines Nepal and a post-grad at Pulchok Engineering Campus. Apart from training, Fusemachines has given engineers who would otherwise have migrated to work in the US and Europe an opportunity to find meaningful work in Nepal. Says Shrestha: “If you create opportunities here, people might actually stay, and once we have mass education in artificial intelligence, companies here will start adopting and see the value of AI products, ensuring more opportunities at home.”",/multimedia,"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 04:00:30 +0000"

There used to be a time when the Central Zoo in Jawalakhel was a menagerie for caged animals that looked miserable. But with help from conservation groups in Nepal and abroad, the zoo has now become a centre for conservation education in Kathmandu and a shelter for rescued wildlife.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Every year, more than 1 million people visit the lush 6-hectare park in the middle of Jawalakhel’s built-up neighbourhood to observe its 942 mammals, birds and fish and 127 species of reptiles. Most of them are students. Much of the credit for upgrading the facility goes to Friends of Zoo, which has in the past 20 years built up a network of 200 schools and 6,000 members which actively involve students in activities like cultural and educational tours to Annapurna Conservation Area Project and Chitwan National Park, a Night Guided Tour, Animal Feeding program and Zoo Clean-up Campaign to teach young people the importance of conservation.

In February, the zoo opened a digital interactive audio-visual centre to share information about the animals through multimedia.    “Conservation education is the only means through which we can educate the general public and students about nature and its importance. It is an important component — that is why we are focusing on digital education as well,” says Chiranjibi Prasad Pokheral, Project Manager of the Central Zoo. Zoo officials are often called to dart leopards or other wildlife in the outskirts of Kathmandu, and many of these animals are brought to the zoo for safety and treatment before being released back into the wild. Others, like a man eating Royal Bengal Tiger named Maharaja rescued from Chitwan National Park is a permanent resident.   























 






















Other long-term guests are pangolins that are rescued from smugglers, and even a pair of chimpanzees that were seized last year while being smuggled from Africa via Kathmandu to India. There are also rhinos, jungle cats, red pandas, barking deer, rhesus macaques and birds like barn owls, budgerigars, golden pheasants, owlets and the Eurasian eagle owl.

To address the problem, 15 hectares of land at the National Zoological Garden in Suryabinayak of Bhaktapur have been set aside for a Wildlife Rescue Centre. The idea is to relocate the zoo itself to Bhaktapur, but a decision to that effect taken in 2015 has still not been implemented due to turf battles between different agencies of government.   























 











 






















“We are hopeful because the government has allocated the budget for a detailed project report for the relocation, but it is a big project and it will take time,” says Pokheral. “We plan on shifting bigger animals to Bhaktapur while keeping the birds, reptiles and butterflies here in Jawalakhel and turn it into a research education centre.” Once it is operational, there will be a shuttle bus to carry visitors between Jawalakhel and the zoological garden 23km away in Surya Binayak.

A procession of uniformed school children walked through the glass door into the Field Marshal Sir John Chapple Education Centre in the Central Zoo one recent morning. They were giggles and pointing at their augmented selves on a monitor alongside a dancing chimp or submerged in an underwater world.  The children file ahead to eight digital kiosks, huddling in small groups answering a nature quiz and playing online games to learn about the animals in the zoo.   Making conservation learning fun and interactive is the purpose of the centre which was set up in February. After retirement from the British Army, Sir John Chapple worked to conserve Nepal’s biodiversity for more than 30 years, and is Chair of the UK National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC). “To pay a modest tribute to a man who has devoted most of his energy to conservation and wildlife seemed like an excellent idea, and with support of the UK NTNC we came up with the idea of an education centre that lives up to the digital era,” says Amita Sen (pictured below), the only Nepali trustee of the UK chapter of NTNC. “The public, especially student visitors, now get fun-filled access to conservation at the touch of a monitor. 























 






















Kathmandu’s zoo is small, but its role in conservation education through the Friends of the Zoo (FOZ) program gives it far bigger importance. FOZ now has 123 partner schools in Nepal and collaborates with Dwight International Schools all over the world. The Education Centre at Central Zoo was funded by Nepal Investment Bank whose president Prithvi Pande recognised the value of making information about nature and conservation accessible to digital natives through state-of-the-art interactive displays. The digital kiosks will soon be updated with Nepali and English language options and with virtual reality glasses that will deliver a virtual tour of the zoo.

King Mahendra made it mandatory for government officials to don the dhaka topi to work 60 years ago, giving the traditional weave state sanction. The fabric had been part of Nepal’s unofficial national dress long before that royal nod, and is today becoming a fashion item.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Dhaka fabric is no longer restricted to the ubiquitous topi — today it is used in saris, shawls, wedding jackets, cushion covers, tote bags and even shoes. In recent years, Nepali designers have experimented with the traditional cloth, transforming both its conventional geometric patterns and colours. Dochaa, a Nepali shoe brand, has curated a line of minimalistic tie-up sneakers with a patch of traditional Nepali fabric woven in (see photos). Their flagship shoe: The Buna Dochaa (buna means woven) comes in maroon and grey dhaka and is woven in looms in Dhankuta, Terathum, Palpa, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.

“We wanted to connect urban and semi-urban Nepalis with traditional dhaka fabric,” says co-founder Watsal Rajbhandari. “Fabric from different parts of the country have distinctive weaves, so we wanted to create a contemporary footwear with that fabric as it would be appealing to our customers, who shy away from ‘glammed’ and glittery use of dhaka.” Dochaa has chosen to be understated, but other designers have been more audacious with their use of dhaka. Actress Swastima Khadka recently wore a full dhaka fabric pantsuit at the SAARC Film Festival, where she won an award for her performance in Bulbul. The outfit was designed by Muku Boutique’s Mukta Shrestha. “Seeing how young, modern and bright Swastima is, I wanted to create something that reflected her contemporary style,” says Shrestha for whom dhaka is an “exciting fabric” with limitless possibilities. Her modern take on dhaka involves bold, bright colours and innovative patterns.  Read Also: Clothed in cannabis in Kathmandu, Pema Sherpa

“Whenever you see dhaka fabric, it is visible, it is very Nepali,” says Shrestha, adding that she wants to bridge the disconnect between urban youth and the classic fabric by developing her own patterns and colours to customise dhaka according to the latest trends for items like evening gowns.  Designer Erina Shrestha, founder of Lakhey Nepal (pictured above), focuses more on the fabric itself rather than experimenting with patterns, melding traditional dhaka with her minimalist clothing designs for a nostalgic effect.  “To me, the dhaka fabric is very unusual because of the widely used colour choices. The greens, blues, red and oranges do not go with the aesthetic I want for my brand,” she says, which is why her use of dhaka is limited to the fabric itself, choosing solid colours instead of multi-colour patterns. Currently, Shrestha is simplifying dhaka with pastel patterns that she plans to use in designing full-length overcoats, preserving the fabric’s simple woven foundation without the distracting colours.        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Read Also: A post mortem of Nepal’s garment boom, Sewa Bhattarai 




























Is dhaka from Dhaka?

Although the dhaka fabric is now emblematic of Nepal’s national dress, it did not originate here. As its name suggests, it actually came from southeast Asia, via then East Bengal during the British days. In fact, experts have traced the patterns and colours of Nepali dhaka to the Bangladeshi jamdani dhakai. While the patterns vary, simply because each piece is a unique creation of the maker, the Nepali dhaka and the jamdani dhakai are both made with cotton, and mainly in handlooms. ‘The geometric flower designs of Bengal’s fabled woven air or jamdani textiles has been skilfully interpreted by the Nepali weaver and block-printed to create the dhaka textile,’ writes Emma Martin, curator and lecturer in museology at the University of Manchester. 























 






















Martin could have been referring to Jessie Brown (1888-1983), a British woman who came to Nepal in the 20th century as a nurse of Princess Nani, the granddaughter of Chandra Shumsher. ‘Brown produced a design that was “heavily influenced by jamdani and dhaka textile motifs”,’ says Martin in her sketchbook. Mohan Raj Sharma (pictured below with dhaka topi) of Palpali Dhaka Pasal in Maitidevi, who has been in the dhaka business for more than 30 years, says that most dhaka traders believe that the Nepali dhaka was inspired by fabric brought from Dhaka in East Bengal, which became Bangladesh in 1971. But how did Palpa become famous for dhaka weaves? Sharma says that in the late 1950s, Ganesh Man Maharjan from Palpa travelled to Dhaka (then in East Pakistan) and encountered beautiful saris made from the delicate muslin jamdani dhakai. 























 






















After learning the process from weavers, Maharjan set up his own factory in Tansen, the Swadeshi Vastrakala Palpali Dhaka, establishing an industry worth more than Rs200 million a year today, according to the Micro Enterprise Development Program. Indeed, Bangladeshi jamdani dhakai closely resembles the Palpali dhaka with its thinner threads, unlike the thicker Purbeli dhaka fabric, and seems to have inspired the Nepali dhaka we see today. According to Sharma, Nepali weavers had to minimise costs so opted for geometrical patterns that were more convenient to design and print, and a sturdier weave to withstand the mountain cold.",/multimedia,"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 02:24:58 +0000"

Here in Dho Valley, in the arid mountains of northwestern Nepal, the only sounds used to be tinkling yak bells and the flapping of wind on prayer flags. Now, there is another one: the throb of internal combustion engines.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Chinese motorcycles roar down the dusty trails of once quiet Dho, and the growl of an excavator can be heard from across the valley. It will not be long before the Sumo pickups arrive from the district headquarter in Dunai, which itself was recently connected to Nepal’s road network.      During his state visit to Nepal last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Nepal would go from being landlocked to‘land-linked’, and promised to help build better road access across the Himalaya from Nepal to China. This is what ‘better connectivity’ looks like here at ground zero in Dolpo.   























 






















One of Nepal’s priorities for trans-Himalayan connectivity is the Kali Gandaki Corridor from the Tarai, through Mustang to the Korala checkpoint at the Chinese border. The new road from Marim Pass on the Tibet border to Dunai has now reached Dho and Chharkha. On parts of the road that are already motorable, motorbikes  noisly overtake trekking groups spewing clouds of dust as they climb the trails. Neither the trekkers nor lodge owners are happy. “They go so fast, they are noisy and irritating. It is dangerous for school children and older people — it will kill someone one day,” grumbles Tenzin Gurung, a monk at the Sitcho gomba. Across the road however, a younger trader is excited about the road since it will provide easier access to the market and bring down the cost of food. 























 






















Such ambivalence has accompanied Nepal’s rapid road-building spree in other parts of the country like Tsum, Manang and Mustang. But perhaps nowhere has the change from no-road to road been as dramatic as here in Dolpo, which was the last district in Nepal  not linked by road. Over on the other side of Mo La pass, at 5,021m, an excavator is clearing a switchback down the rocky slope that follows the trekking trail, which itself followed the ancient trading route from Dolpo to Mustang. Read also: Bon voyage, Sonam Choekyi Lama      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “The weather is challenging, it is windy and cold on the pass, and we have to bring the diesel up by mule from Mustang,” says excavator operator Padam Bahadur. Those who own lodges and depend on trekking groups for income are opposed to the road. Even if it is built, they say it should not destroy the traditional trading routes and trekking trails.  























 






















Says Sonam Lama, an architect who fought a losing battle to prevent the road to his native Tsum Valley: “These hiking trails should not be replaced by roads. We should try to find an alternative motorable road.” The dozers are also ploughing across holy chorten and mani walls. The excavator driver, who is from Piuthan, says he had to “relocate” a mani wall because it was obstructing the road alignment determined by the surveyor.

Villagers in Chharkha ask why Dolpo should not follow the example of Kagbeni, where the road to Lo Manthang bypassed the old cobble-stone streets of the town to preserve its heritage. Indeed, Dolpo seems to be making the same mistake as other parts of Nepal. With little oversight by local or national governments, it looks like change is too big and too quick for Dolpo to handle. “There is no reason why the road had to follow the trekking trails, go through the villages and destroy our holy shrines,” says Ramprasad Sherchan, owner of the Muktinath Hotel in Kagbeni. However, Sherchan now sees potential for more trekkers going to Dolpo via Mustang since the district will be more accessible.",/multimedia,"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 04:16:11 +0000"

There is something inherently elitist about labels like ‘expat’ and ‘diaspora’. They refer to skilled Nepalis studying, working or living abroad and not to the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers when, in fact, both are just individuals moving out for better opportunities.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But Nepal’s migrant economy has also opened up new business prospects, as Kalyan Ghimire discovered. It was during a trip to Qatar to organise a musical event for Nepalis that he saw a market for ‘nostalgic products’ like dalle khursani and gundruk among the 400,000 Nepalis in Qatar.  “On one hand, I saw Qatar’s reliance on imports of vegetables, especially after the embargo, with a high share of Nepalis as the consumers of these imports,” Ghimire explained. “On the other hand, farmers in Nepal were destroying produce using dozers to protest low prices.” Although he had little experience in the trade, Ghimire set out on a mission to play the role of a link by establishing Al Saman International. His business intuition told him Nepali migrant workers could be customers, marketers and advisers.

He says: “Nepali workers were reluctant in the beginning to believe that it was do-able. But once they saw the possibility, they are doing everything to help us.” It required just the first few orders for the business to take off. Nepalis were the biggest consumers and helped spread the word. A wave of selfies by migrant workers next to ‘Nepali Vegetables’ signs proliferated on social media. The red hot dalle khursani chillies have been a particular hit, including among Pakistanis. “Word of mouth and social media did wonders in expanding our consumer base,” says Saman Ghimire, who adds that Nepalis working in supermarkets go out of their way to help spread the word. “A Nepali bhai in one mart even changed the placement of our vegetables as he thought they were not visible enough.”   Ghimire’s Facebook account now resembles review websites like Yelp. Workers send unsolicited reviews and advice. One of them reads in Nepali: “I was at the Able mart the other day where special vegetables from India and Bangladesh were being sold. There was a huge crowd of buyers there, including Nepalis. I recommend you to explore this possibility.” Read also: US ban on Malaysian glove exporter affects Nepalis, Upasana Khadka 























 






















Recently, Qataris were spotted buying gundruk in Ghimire’s partner store in Doha, Fresh Food Mart. With many Nepalis working as cooks, their employers seem to have developed a taste for the fermented Nepali dish as well. The company has streamlined a supply chain to fly consignments of fresh Nepali veggies to Doha every Wednesday and Sunday. The seven markets place their orders a day or two before. Back in Nepal, farmers bring their produce to a collection point in Satdobato early morning on shipment day. The produce is graded, packaged and sent to the airport quarantine office, then put into the cargo holds of flights to Qatar. A team at Doha airport receives the shipments and dispatches them to market. This Wednesday orders were placed for 1,900kg of fiddleheads, chillies, radish, French beans and bamboo shoots.

For example, there is a big demand for coriander and mustard leaves, but they have a short shelf-life and attempts to export them have not worked out. One big challenge is the cost of air freight, which puts Nepali produce at a price disadvantage compared to items from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The government could help by setting a lower rate for perishables in the cargo holds of Doha-bound aircraft.

US ban on Malaysian glove exporter affects Nepalis 






















 










The suspension of exports from Malaysia-based WRP Asia Pacific, a glove manufacturer, by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Detention Orders this month has been hailed as a milestone in the fight against forced labour and has potential implications for Nepali workers in Malaysia. WRP Asia Pacific was accused of using forced labour at its plants in Malaysia, and the order has reverberated throughout the rubber sector, which accounts for 65% of the global glove industry.The company made headlines recently after a strike by over 2,000 Nepali and Bangladeshi workers, who said they had not been paid for months.“We held a strike for two days, and resumed work only after our Embassy intervened and the employer was forced to pay due wages. 






















We have been paid in a timely manner since then, but we don’t know how the ban will affect our future,” said Dipak Rai, a Nepali worker. The media reports led Malaysia’s Ministry of Human Resource to file a court case against WRP Asia Pacific. The US move is as per its Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, which makes imports produced by forced labour illegal. Other countries also have laws for due diligence in global supply chains, like the French Corporate Duty of Vigilance Bill or the UK’s Modern Slavery Act, holding parent companies liable for activities of subcontractors and suppliers. The CBP order has also halted imports from four other countries: China (garments), Brazil (bone charcoal), Democratic Republic of Congo (gold) and Zimbabwe (diamonds). It is difficult for the Nepal Government to unilaterally lobby or watch-dog destination countries outside its jurisdiction to ensure compliance of labour standards in ‘dangerous, dirty and difficult’ jobs Nepalis do. Given that migrant workers do not have freedom of association in many destination countries, collective bargaining is not always possible. The Nepal Government has tried to bypass the limitations by requiring Nepal-based recruitment agencies to be held accountable for non-compliance of contractual terms by a foreign employer. Licensed recruiters now have to contribute to escrow deposits so workers are compensated in case of exploitation. Malaysia is now proposing a new chapter on forced labour in its Employment Act, and pushing companies to conduct social audits, which they have so far been reluctant to do. A case like the WRP one can push for tangible outcomes for the welfare of often-overlooked workers, and could set a precedent for systemic reforms in labour migration.

It is said that food is eaten first with the eyes. But on our two-month food tour across Nepal recently, we felt that food may be first eaten with the ears. Delicious descriptions drew us to dishes even before we saw them. We heard of many exotic dishes: milk buried underground for six months in Jumla until it fermented into yoghurt, meat marinated for a week before it is eaten in Kalikot, meat belonging to the entire community cooked in a single dish in Gulmi. Cake-like dishes made of rice, millet and other flour that are not known outside the districts they are eaten in.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Read also:Tharu escargots, Sewa Bhattarai Food of the royals 























 










We have always been told that Nepalis don’t have names that correspond to breakfast, lunch and dinner, but have only meals and snacks (khana and khaja). However, the Tharu have names for five different meals, according to the time of the day they are served in. Communities that migrated most, especially Brahmins and Chhetris, had lost most of their culinary heritage. Yet in Baitadi, we saw that those who had stayed behind retained their original foods. All of this led us to ask ‘What exactly is Nepal food?’ Is dal bhat tarkari the national dish? Are foods in Nepal original, and is there a commonality between the country’s varied cuisines? 






















Bhat (steamed rice) cannot solely define Nepali food in a country where indigenous grains like wheat, corn, buckwheat, millet, barley and others are grown abundantly, and roasted and steamed into bread, boiled into porridge, or ground for storage. Any one of these can be taken as a staple food. Beyond that, lentils form an essential part of our diet, though their cooking varies according to geography and ethnicity. Read also: The superfoods of the Andes and the Himalaya, Sonia Awale Much more than dal bhat, Anil Chitrakar Vegetables are eaten Nepalwide, mostly fried, and sometimes boiled. Oil to fry them in, and turmeric for its colour and medicinal property, are essential to Nepali cuisine. Green leafy vegetables saag differentiate the Nepali thali from North Indian ones. Gundruk, sinki, tama, kinema, and other foods made by fermenting leaves, bamboo shoots, or beans are common across Nepali kitchens. So are dairy products like milk, yoghurt and buttermilk, and it is a tradition to flavour rice with a bit of ghiu. As for meat, there is no uniformity. Some like pork and others buffalo, both forbidden by other communities. Nepali cuisine is lacking when it comes to dessert, and many communities do not even have the tradition of eating sweets. Nepal’s most exotic dishes are not found in restaurants but eaten only at home. While this preserves their taste, it also limits the dish to a small family group. Read also: Could Nepali cuisine go global, Thomas Heaton In this age of easily available packaged food, we are losing slow-cooked foods that once used to enhance the taste, smell and nutritional value of foods. Not just our recipes and cooking techniques, but our entire agriculture system has fallen prey to commercial agriculture, and many indigenous foods are not grown any more.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); After our culinary journey across Nepal, our conclusion is that there is no standard ‘Nepali food’. It is our duty to define, and refine, our ethnic dishes and preserve their originality. We need to get these dishes to restaurant tables around the world by cooking, eating and propagating them ourselves. Nepali food deserves to go worldwide.    















































Tharu 






















 
















Tharus who live in the plains make use of all the ingredients around them, including aquatic animals like fish, snails, clams, shrimp and crabs. You name it and Tharus make a delicious dish out of it. They are also famous for eating healthy, with their staple grains and vegetables steamed or boiled. It used to be that Tharu food was only available during the Maghi festival at Tundikhel. But Tharu restaurants in Kathmandu now provide the food all the year round. Barghar Restaurant in Kirtipur provides all the traditional Tharu delights, even crabs and clams.

Thakali 






















 
















Though Thakalis live in Mustang where rice does not grow, Thakali restaurants have become synonymous with the typical Nepali dal bhat tarkari. That might be because they were historically traders and were exposed to foreign foods. The Thakali thali  use Himalayan spices like jimbu and timur. They have also retained many indigenous dishes like kanchemba (pictured, left), fries made of buckwheat, which grows abundantly in Mustang. Thakali food needs to be branded and standardised so that it doesn’t lose its originality, and the production of local ingredients can be promoted.

Thakali food has come to mean tasty dal-bhat-tarkari, and spic and span Thakali restaurants can be found all over Nepal, and even abroad. 















































Sherpa 






















 






















Sherpa cuisine is derived from Tibetan, and is designed for the cold harsh climate of the high mountains. Rigikur, a potato and buckwheat bread, is rich in butter and eaten with cheese sauce. Shyakpa, or meat soup, is consumed piping hot any time of the day. And su chiya, a unique salt and milk tea, is also had with dollops of butter. Tasmpa, a popular breakfast, is made by grinding grains like buckwheat, millet, wheat, or a combination of them, and is had with milk and honey. Though Sherpa food is rarely found  in most mainstream restaurants of Kathmandu, they are common in the Bouddha area. Newly opened Sherpa Cafe in Jhamsikhel caters to customers in Patan.

Newa 





















Newa cuisine is rich and varied. Samye-baji is the standard mid-day snack and also a festive delight, where beaten rice is eaten with many vegetables and condiments. Spicy potato salad, bara (lentil flatbread), beans, soybeans and marinated buffalo meat are popular accompaniments. Almost every little alley in Kathmandu contains a Newari restaurant, serving samye-baji, bara, chatamari (rice bread), and other dishes. The choices range from low-end corner shops to high end outlets like Dwarika’s Hotel in Battisputali. 











 






































































Rai/Limbu 






















 






















Pork meat is a staple of the Rai and Limbu communities in eastern Nepal. Sargemba (pictured), or blood sausage, is made by stuffing blood and seasonings into pig intestines, and then cut and fried before it is eaten. The pork curry Yangben-Fakso (left) is also unique, flavoured with a lichen called yangben, soaked in warm water and mixed with pork blood. It goes well with chamre  (fried rice) and kinema  (fermented beans).

Manju Chaudhary sinks her hand into a little pond and brings up a tiny, conch-shaped shell. Inside it is an even tinier water snail. When she has collected a handful she goes to the kitchen, where she boils them and cuts away the inedible tails. The rest she fries with her favourite spices and eats it with rice, sucking the flesh out of the shell.        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Many in Nepal would look askance at this dish, but among the Tharus ghonghi snails are a delicacy. The indigenous Tharu people live along the southern plains, and despite different customs and costumes among sub-groups, they share a love for snails. In fact, the Tharu are fond of eating all aquatic life — from fish and fresh-water shrimp to exotic tiny crabs and clams.  Read also: Exploring Nepal’s culinary diversity’, Kedar Sharma and Kiran Sharma Food of the royals 























 











 






















“We harvest them ourselves from rivers and ponds,” says Chaudhary, who is from Sunsari. “We had a pond near our home, and brought handfuls of snails from the river and put them in. They multiply fast, and there is enough ghonghi to last a year.” Snails are eaten as a hors d’oeuvre or with the main rice meal, and has a slightly slippery texture, tasting like creamy mushrooms. In general, Tharu cuisine is known to be very healthy as it includes fresh leafy greens which are boiled and not fried, very little oil is used. Full of proteins, snails are said to heal wounds and broken bones faster. However, ghonghi is not well known outside the Tharu community and many Nepalis are not even aware that snails are edible.

Labour migration touches every Nepali in one way or another. The pain of departure at the airport, the joy of reunion. Aspirations drive us to move to wherever we get more credit, recognition or money. The confidence with which a person fastens the seat-belt on a plane reveals whether Doha is the final destination or just a place of transit – and that determines treatment by flight attendants. Regardless of the differences in where, why and how we move, we are all aspiring for a better shot at life. Read also:  Back to Nepal for good?, Upasana Khadka      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); For Nepal’s migrant workers, good news in small bites, Upasana Khadka The migrant industry has evolved: the private sector has seen an opportunity for arbitrage, the government tries to regulate it with policies, and the media, human rights organisations and non-profits are story-tellers, watchdogs and advocates. Platforms like the Global Compact for Migration and the Sustainable Development Goals advocate a ‘whole-of-society’ approach where different stakeholders will work collectively to advance the goals of good migration. We have come a long way, but we need to see more tangible impact. The discussion has to move from what should be to where we actually are. The chasm between de-jure and de-facto in the foreign employment industry is so wide that it is easy to fall between the cracks.  Everyone is quick to point out that zero-cost migration is not happening. There is public litigation and there are supreme court orders. We hold rallies and conferences and we write about the issue. There are random surveys at airports that seek to find out what workers are paying. And guess what, it is not zero. Read also: Greens from Nepal in Qatar’s desert, Upasana Khadka While this attention is necessary to keep the debate alive, the focus of our discourse should now shift from ‘if’ it can be implemented to ‘why’ it has not been, and ‘how’ it can be enforced. Workers are willing to pay. Let’s start there. They are convinced there is a brighter future waiting for them. If you take me to America, I will pay you $40,000. If you get me a janitor job in West Asia, I will pay $1,500. If you find me a security guard or driver job, I may pay you $5,000. The cases that end up coming to the notice of authorities are those in which there is no job in return for the money spent. By the time this becomes clear, it is too late because the worker does not have proof of the transaction. On the flipside, after the provision in the Malaysia-Nepal MOU requiring employers to pay for visa and ticket, Malaysian companies are reportedly lamenting that it is too expensive to hire Nepalis. Let that sink in: a profit-driven industry in Malaysia is complaining about losing competitiveness after having to bear the costs that had otherwise been borne by a poor worker himself. Read also:  The workers’ football, Upasana Khadka Irresistible forces: wage differential and demographic trends, Upasana Khadka      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The recruiters are taking advantage of the absolute desperation of workers for a better life. They know their role is indispensable and that it will remain so. When one worker is charged in exchange for a promised job, it costs $1,000. If one considers that every one of the 4 million workers mobilised in the last decade paid this amount, the total is astronomical. There is also double dipping: with employers paying for the same placement. With that kind of money floating around, decisions on political careers and diplomatic postings can be swayed. To flourish in the foreign employment sector in Nepal Labour Ministers or bureaucrats have to be willing participants in sharing the loot, or complacent and indifferent.  Anything else, and you are out. Despite all this, a comparative study on recruitment costs borne by workers from Bangladesh or Pakistan are at least three to four-fold more than what a Nepali worker pays. If there are positive ways to reduce costs based on practical lessons, those should drive our narrative and not just de jure principles. Research and advocacy should focus on identifying the few employers who are actually willing to participate in the zero-cost scheme, like the Responsible Business Alliance-affiliated employers in Malaysia. Read also: Shared stories, shattered dreams of South Asian migrant workers, Sonia Awale The driving force for this may very well be pressure on the employer from due diligence imposed by headquarters in Europe and America, and not concern for the worker. Recent surprise raids by the Department of Foreign Employment (DOFE) in response to worker complaints seem promising. But how much longer before the current Director General of DOFE is seen as a threat and is transferred? What can be done to instill fear among the 850 plus recruiters in Kathmandu that such raids are not an exception but the rule? How can recent bilateral agreements for zero-cost migration be operationalised? What we need now is what scholars call ‘labour market realism’, that implementation needs to begin from labour market realities rather than ideals and principles. Our efforts are inadequate if we limit ourselves to finding out from a handful of workers that they are paying, or if we continue to inform a handful of potential workers that they should not be paying, knowing very well that the minute they are in the clutches of the recruiter, they will pay.  Upasana Khadka writes this column Labour Mobility every month in Nepali Times analysing trends affecting Nepal’s workers abroad.",/opinion,"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 02:27:44 +0000"

Where is Nepal? A: Good question. We’re just trying to figure that out ourselves. In a philosophical sense you could say that we don’t know where we are at the present juncture of history, or the direction we are headed as a nation state. Q: Why doesn’t Kathmandu have any working traffic lights?Because an automatic traffic light has not yet been invented which can detect an approaching VVIP motorcade and stop all vehicular movements at intersections for a minimum of one hour. Q: How is Nepal promoting tourism in 2020?Nepal will not meet the 2 million target in 2020. It will exceed it. The Minister of Tourism, Marxism and Leninism is in Australia as we speak to offer people there safe haven in Nepal. The minister also got the brainwave to require all of Nepal’s 4 million overseas workers to wear #VNY2020 t-shirts at construction sites in Saudi Arabia and in palm oil plantations in Malaysia. Q: What is Nepal best known for? The birthplace of Lord Buddha. Home of Lord Ram’s in-laws. The highest mountain in the world. As the highest per capita producer of instant noodles.Always 15 minutes ahead of Indian Standard Time. For the world’s friendliest and most trustworthy crooks. Q: How do people commonly greet each other in Nepal? “Khanu bho?” Translation: Have you partaken in a bribe yet? Q: What are some common Nepali customs?Never offer anything with your left hand, it is considered rude. If it is offered under the table, taking with either hand is OK.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Q: Any tips on dining etiquette?To blend in with your hosts, chew loudly with your mouth open. After finishing your meal, show gratitude and appreciation by burping in a loud and carefree manner. Q: What other cultural sensitivities should I keep in mind? Public display of affection is considered offensive. Refrain from holding hands in the streets unless you are of the same sex. Q: How do I ensure that my visit will help Nepal’s economy?Always insist on paying three times more than what locals pay for meals, museum tickets and domestic air transport.

Many conversations these days about the coming 2020s decade for Nepal, somehow always turns to a debate about our past.  Usually it is the fatalists and those who have profited by sending Nepali workers and students abroad who use the lost opportunities about the past to make a case to justify their business. They make it a point to run down Nepal and its vast potential to move ahead in order to justify their argument that the best option is to leave.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Few still romanticise the past because that is where they had their space and comfort. Historical wrongs have taken place here, as they have all over the world. There are do-able ways to correct these injustices to ensure that we can coexist peacefully into the future. But for many, village life was that past and life in the city here and around the world is the future. Attempts to get the discussion back to the future and the potential that Nepal has for growth and prosperity, often drift back into needless comparisons with other countries. Nepal can, should and needs to learn from other countries, but it is a bit like comparing apples and oranges.  The USA was partly built by slaves and the British enriched themselves by exploiting colonies. We do not have oil like the Gulf. We do not have a relatively homogenous society like Japan. What are we comparing, then when we compare Tokha to Tokyo, or Dhumbarahi to Dubai?    It is not helpful to take one narrow example and to extrapolate to generalise it as the universal development principle. Many study tours that Nepalis have taken are quite futile because they actually end up in raising a greater sense of helplessness.  The Nepali resolution for the 2020 decade has to be to built more on what we can be and not so much on the way we were. Lessons are useful, but what good is it to organise a donors’ meeting when we are actually seeking investments?  How useful are lessons on Leninism from the Soviet era? What is the use of planning for a fossil economy when the path ahead is clean and renewable energy? The world must resolve not to repeat the failure of the Madrid Climate Summit. The coming decade has to be about innovation and creativity that will benefit many more people who have been left behind.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); A new decade has begun with many parts of Australia burning, the Persian Gulf is in a hair trigger, Europe and the UK have started divorce proceedings, and large cities in the most populated areas of the world like Jakarta and Venice are going underwater.  Yet, many Nepali migrants have chosen these very countries as where the grass is greener. Yes Nepal is plagued with political uncertainty, corruption, nepotism, and bad air quality. For Nepalis who migrated to New South Wales, it must feel like from the frying pan into the fire. In the USA many Nepali Americans face the possibility of being drafted into an escalating war.   If we stopped focusing on the past, making irrelevant comparisons, we could actually begin to look at Nepal’s future more objectively. For example, Nepal is an upstream country. This word is often not used to describe Nepal and what its comparative advantage could be. Being an upper riparian has numerous advantages and opens up all kinds of possibilities.  A country of 30 million is not small. And Nepal is not poor, just poorly governed. So let us stop describing ourselves as “a small and poor country”. Having a young population is not a liability but a historic opportunity that is the envy of rapidly-ageing countries like Japan.  One thing we will need while moving ahead is to restore our faith in ourselves.  Recently, climbing the steps of Swayambhu a fellow-walker remarked, “If people went to work with the same faith as they do when they go to temples, Nepal would surely develop.” Anil Chitrakar is President of Siddharthinc.",/opinion,"Tue, 07 Jan 2020 07:17:19 +0000"

So, it looks like we have come full circle, and the good old bad days are here again. After struggling for freedom for five decades since 1960, we are finally rediscovering that war is peace, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength in the Federal Democratic Republic of Animal Farm.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But we detect a certain complacency setting in among the Comrades: they are showing signs of smugness and hints of laxity in decisively cracking down on dissent. It looks like The Dear Leader and his Commie Hardliners are losing the fire in their bellies, and becoming somewhat half-hearted tyrants. After coming this far and burning all our bridges, we can’t let this happen. There is still a long way to go before we can aspire to be DPRK. The Party therefore now has to ask itself: is it being draconian enough in safeguarding Nepal’s hard-won authoritarianism? Why this piecemeal approach towards total control? As Mao said: “Revolution is not a dinner party, you cannot make a cheese omelette without milking a few yaks, and political power comes out of a barrel of whiskey.” So, what are they waiting for? Why are they pussyfooting with the IT Bill, Media Council Bill and the Grocery Bill? This is no time for hemming and hawing, they should roll up their sleeves and get to work, since time and tidal wave waits for no man. More vigilance, that is what we need. And more vigilantes. I wouldn’t make the mistake of saying our crackdowns have to be beefed up since that would ruffle religious sensibilities in a friendly neigbouring country, but there is no doubt that they need to be buffed up. We can’t afford to leave even one stone turned upside down to weed out the vestiges of freedom. How come independent journalists and activists are still roaming around the streets in broad daylight hours? Why aren’t they in custody yet? We are now three days into 2020, and the Ass is still not under preventive custody for ridiculing, demeaning, and belittling the liliputs in government. Such a lackadaisical attitude towards implementation of our laws just won’t suffice. What do we have to do burn some tyres and set fire to effigies?

 Tiger Mountain Pokhara Lodge has won the Conde Nast Traveler Best Ecolodge, National Geographic Global Top 50 EcoLodges and Conservation International’s Ecotourism Award UK Sunday Times’ top five cool pools
























The guests were dressed with care as befits the end of an era. The New Year’s Eve atmosphere was buoyant but grave, with the usual eclectic Tiger Mountain mix. Old Asia-hands from Singapore and Thailand were gathered with Swiss family, British friends, Kathmandu expats, Tibetan cousins and Nepali hosts, all reflecting on the massive significance of the passing millennium. The grandeur of the Himalayan scenery matched our mood. It was 31 December 1999 and we were perched on a ridgetop above the Bijaypur Khola in Tiger Mountain Pokhara Lodge. Far beneath us, the lights of Pokhara Valley twinkled in the winter cold, and the soaring white peaks glowed pale in the moonlight. On the hillside opposite some farmers were razing their fields, and the fires spread out slowly until they formed the unmistakable shape of a giant burning cross.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Jim Edwards leaned against the stone column beside the Lodge’s picture window. “Perhaps we should heed such a powerful symbol,” he said quietly. Despite the cosy warmth and the blazing central fireplace, a shiver went down my spine. 
























 Guests at the Pokhara Lodge opening in 1998 included Lady June Hillary and Toni Hagen
























There were a few things to worry about, not least the widespread concern that the digital world would come crashing down on the stroke of midnight, which had kept our diplomatic friends on high alert in their embassies. To no avail as it turned out, but the rumours had been rife and convincing. In Nepal, the brutal insurgency was rumbling with increasing vigour throughout the country. It would be another six years before peace was achieved, a time of such trauma that it is buried deep into a collective national amnesia. The horror of the royal massacre was 18 months ahead of us and, three months after that, the 9/11 terror tragedy of the twin towers which changed our world forever. Pokhara Lodge had been shaken with an evening raid by alleged insurgents that carried off not only the terrace telescope and some staff cameras, but the bulging contents of the end-of-season tip box, which seemed rather harsh given their declared ideology. The attack was the first of relatively few direct clashes with tourism during those deeply troubled times. No one was harmed, and even the resident guests were unalarmed, confusing the red bandanas, flags and brandished khukri knives as part of a cultural show. 
























 Sir Edmund Hillary inaugurated Tiger Mountain Pokhara Lodge on 2 Oct 1998, with Capt SV Gurung, Pokhara CDO, Rudi Kinajil, Lisa, Dinesh Thapa and Kristjen Edwards
























On that millennial eve, Pokhara Lodge had been operating for just over a year. The trees and wild landscaping had yet to mature around the honey-coloured stone bungalows, hand-cut from a local quarry, clustered like a local village adjacent to our community forest neighbours. The swimming pool bamboos were still in their infancy, but the peaks were already mirrored in its shimmering blue surface on a breathless morning as eagles, vultures and kites wheeled overhead. Sir Edmund Hillary had done the inauguration honours, stooping stiffly to light the votive brass lamp on the broad slate veranda one clear October day, with expansive views of the Himalaya range stretching from Dhaulagiri to Manaslu. At various stages of construction, monks and priests had blessed the hilltop site, selected by Colonel Jimmy Roberts as the first campground on Prince Charles’ original Royal Trek in 1980.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); I had walked the first recce of that route for Mountain Travel with Pertemba Sherpa, a circuit now driveable down unappetising dusty rutted roads, because Colonel Jimmy’s hips were already failing him and his walking days were over. I stayed behind to manage the media that early December day 40 years ago, as the Prince of Wales strode uphill towards the silhouetted skyline tree that now bears his name, accompanied by Prince Dhirendra and a royal retinue. “The mountain views were ‘gin clear’ for all four days,” Colonel Jimmy noted in satisfaction.

As we hurtle into another shiny new decade, pondering on what lies ahead, hopes run high for a better prognosis as we face the clean slate of the future. Our New Year resolutions this time can be more ambitious than the annual self-improvements destined to peter out by February. Nepal’s full potential for generating hydropower can happen, even as glaciers retreat and river levels drop, the patient queues at hitis and water taps testament to a depleting water table. The realities of rail travel are still a dream away, victim to the overwhelming odds against running rails through the world’s highest, youngest and least stable mountain chain. But electric bikes and cars are beginning to ply the Valley, and all sorts of innovative no-plastic and waste solutions are being trialled and adopted. 
























 VNY2020 is honouring the old and bold who contributed to Nepal’s tourism development, including Toni Hagen, Jim Edwards and Sir Edmund Hillary 1998
























The energy and opportunity of the much-awaited Visit Nepal Year 2020 is upon us, with a plethora of creative events, new product ideas, and even an appreciation of the old and bold who have shaped tourism in the past. Hopefully, new international airports around the country will improve our travel patterns, pushing tourists beyond the much-treaded Kathmandu-Pokhara-Chitwan triangle with new destinations that can deliver the delights of Nepali culture and adventure. Even as roads penetrate the heights and scar the hillsides, trekkers can disperse beyond the Everest-Annapurna-Langtang circuits, bringing benefits to the pristine and scarcely-visited sections east and west along the Great Himalaya Trail. At this dawn of a new decade, let us tune our ears to the rhythms of history, use the commitment of VNY2020 and push beyond the cliché: Plus ca change, plus c’est la meme chose. Seize the decade.

Of late, international news like climate change, the collapse of liberal democracy or the destruction of the Amazon have started crowding out equally earth-shattering news here at home, such as the divorce of Ram Krishna Dhakal.       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); If this important news was dropped for lack of space, imagine the other significant happenings in 2019 that did not make it to the m-ass media. That is why it is more vital than ever that in the national interest we bring our valued customers up to speed on happenings on the domestic front without fear or favourites.  We media lapdogs have followed with growing alarm the erosion of journalistic values in this country as the fourth estate abandons its hallowed principles, engages in yellow journalism and refrains from reporting on mammon and mammaries. There are some among us who shall remain unnamed who still insist on reporting all the news that is fit to print, leaving out the bigotry, prejudice and preconceived notions.

Things improve imperceptibly in Nepal, with small changes for the better. And that is the first thing frequent visitors to Kathmandu notice at the airport: the shining new floor of the arrival concourse and various gold-plated, hand-crafted figures at the base of the escalators. It shows that with just a small effort, we can improve the state of the state. Tourism provides the incentive for positive actions in the past, and will help us do much more as we enter Visit Nepal 2020 when the country is hoping to double the number of visitors.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Tourism can also be attributed to creating jobs, lifting people out of poverty, helping save endangered species and their habitats, letting income percolate down to remote areas, and helping heritage conservation in a big way. With politics more stable, and power outages behind us, Kathmandu Valley’s World Heritage Sites are lit for nighttime visitors. Horticulture farms producing organic food, art and crafts studios and workshops, chefs and hospitality staff, are all doing better. More and more hotels with better amenities give the sector the much needed competition that will focus on better quality of services. Tourism is good for Nepal, contributing up to 10% of the GDP according to one estimate. As disposable income increases, more Nepali families are opting to travel and spend. These ‘domestic tourists’ on average spend more than the ‘budget tourists’ who came to Nepal because it is often sold as a cheap destination. Hotels that would deny rooms and services to Nepalis now prefer them. Campaigns that call on people to travel within Nepal first, and then venture out into the world. (‘Pahila Desh, Ani Bidesh) are helping. The governor of Nepal Rastra Bank recently lamented that Nepali ‘tourists’ took Rs90 billion worth of foreign currency out of Nepal as compared to Rs74 billion brought in by foreigners.

Some say Nepalis, who used to save money, buy gold or land, are now spending more because of the near death experience during the 2015 earthquake. Religious sites like Manakamana were always popular, but now with increased mobility and spare change, Nepali pilgrims throng far flung temples. A foreign visitor asks where two million tourists will stay when millions of Nepalis are travelling. Good point. Thirty years ago the trend was globalisation, and now there is a definite move towards localisation. Climate awareness has actually resulted in a drop in air travel in some European countries. Local restaurants with local drinks are doing better than those offering imported ones. Thakali restaurants used to be confined to the Mugling-Pokhara corridor, now they are everywhere. Textiles, handicrafts, building materials, design elements, food, fruits, sweets,yogurt, spices, tea, coffee, are all doing well because people want to try local.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Conversations these days are often dominated by, “Have you been to this amazing restaurant at Lakeside in Pokhara?” The social media is helping because friends and influencers post photos of Nepal’s most exotic places. Schools, colleges and businesses are going further afield within Nepal for field trips. Nepal has two neighbors that have the highest number of outbound travelers in the world, and it is growing. These markets have special needs and may not match traditional North America or European clientele. Food, shopping, pilgrimage, corporate retreats, meetings, medical checkups, banking, ease of travel could be some of the reasons they may visit Nepal. With these giant markets next door, all we need to do is tailor-make our promotional campaigns in their language, and to suit their tastes. To be sure, we will have to monitor alcohol, gambling and prostitution. We need staff trained with better language skills and safety standards and paid and treated with respect. Flight and vehicle safety need to be regularly upgraded. The travel trade is changing, and the tourism entrepreneur has to be proactive. As the Visit Nepal slogan declares, visitors are looking for a lifetime experience and not a mediocre trip. We have the challenge to offer an experience that is distinctly different than China, India and Bhutan – but that does not mean visitors want to rough it out. We have to move towards carbon neutral tourism that contributes to conservation of nature and heritage. And: we have to stop selling poverty and volunteer tourism. Let us not make it sound like the tourist is doing us a favor by coming here. Let them come because they want to, because Nepal is special. It has to be a lifetime experience.

Mount Everest has always held mythical status for me, like the Great Wall of China and the Pyramids of Giza. Growing up on the ‘other side of the world’ I knew about them from a very young age: their mystery was seeded in my imagination as a schoolboy in Canada. I have not visited the Great Wall or the pyramids, but I remember the mountain flight that took me close to Everest about 12 years ago. It was cloudy when we left Kathmandu but clear enough that the rocky triangle above the Lhotse-Nuptse ridge could be pointed out as we flew past in our tiny plane.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Now Everest, like the entire Himalayan range that stretches from Pakistan to China, is a victim of global heating. The permanent ice on many of these mountains is melting and once snowy white peaks have become dark rock. Mountaineers have reported a thawing of the exposed ridges en route to the Everest summit, which is exposing the bodies of dead climbers. Below Everest, the Rongbuk, Khumbu and other glaciers are thinning and receding fast. Read also: Make-or-break decade for climate action, Ajaya Dixit Global heating melts mountains, Nepali Times The startling thing about what is happening to the Himalaya is that it does not seem to really bother many people, or at least those who make decisions about what does and does not get done on Planet Earth. Certainly the news did not spur world leaders to take effective action on global heating at the unsuccessful Climate Summit (COP25) in Madrid that ended last week. If they cannot be moved to save Mt Everest and the Roof of the World, will those leaders take action in the name of the 1.9 billion people who depend on these mountains and others like it worldwide? A report released to coincide with COP25 details how the Indus water tower, which includes much of the Himalaya, and 77 other glacier-based water systems worldwide are diminishing faster than imagined. The result: the rivers fed by the water towers will shrink, and shrink some more, and soon the water sources that people rely upon to sustain their lives will become too small for everyone. This is already happening in some places. A 2010 study found that rainfall has decreased 7.5% in South Asia from 1900 to 2005. At the start of 2019, nearly 3 million people were said to be affected by the worst drought to strike Pakistan in years. Read also: Nepal’s silent emergency: springs going dry, Ajaya Dixit      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Yet the increasingly precarious lives of people already existing in the margins, plus the threat to nearly one-quarter of the world’s population who rely on the water towers, did not move world leaders into action at Madrid. Must we reduce this equation to something more basic, like self-interest? Have governments thought about where all those people who survive to escape the shrinking water systems will go? Climate migrants are already on the move in growing numbers.  To date, studies have focused on internal migration. For example, a recent World Bank report predicted that if current trends continue, up to 143 million people in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Central America could be displaced by 2050 because of climate change. Yet anecdotally, the environmental impacts of a heating planet are known to be a factor in migration from Latin America northward through Mexico toward the US, and from Africa toward Europe. So far the west has been able to engineer and/or spend its way out of the most drastic impacts of climate change. But given the growing number, and intensity, of extreme weather events, how long will that be the case? Ideally, world leaders would act on climate change because they find it unacceptable to be watching over the irreversible degradation of Planet Earth, or because they consider it immoral to watch the sources of water that sustain one-quarter of the world’s people slowly go dry. Unfortunately, it might just take the threat of a growing wave of climate migrants to provoke real policy change. The risk, of course, is that faced with growing numbers knocking on their doors, countries start to lock down their borders, à la the United States. Let us hope that others will be wise enough to see there is a better alternative — cutting CO2 emissions in order to slow global heating, so that those living the most precarious lives will not have to choose between moving or perishing.",/opinion,"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 02:41:41 +0000"

Thanks to the Grand Unification Party for rehabilitating ‘smuggling’ so it is no longer a bad word. This recognises the fact that Nepal’s entire economic model has historically rested on smuggling gold, mobile phones, palm oil, onions and other precious cargo from across the northern border, and hauling it over the southern border.The other item of illegal trade is oxen. (Always wondered about that one. Why not ‘oxes’? We never ask: “Where do I put these boxen?”) It is time we loosened border controls so our bullocks can stray into Indian territory without let or hindrance. Smugglers can even use the oxymorons as pack animals and conceal contraband vodka in their false bottoms.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Smuggling contributes more to Nepal’s GDP than remittances and tourism combined. We should restore the trade’s respectability so that the bandicoots of contraband will get the recognition they deserve. At parties, it is encouraging to see well-known smugglers finally coming out of the closet (so to speak): “Oh, have you met? He smuggles ball bearings.” “Pleasure. We smuggle motherboards.”“Hello. Gold biscuits.”“I am spiriting spirits into Bihar, cheers!” At last GONe has mustered the political will to provide smuggling multistakeholder acknowledgement and allow FDI and joint ventures in the sector. The first signs of change are already visible at Kathmandu Airport. The arrival concourse now has Red Channel (Communists with lots to declare), Green Channel (Environmental activists with nothing to declare) and the Back Channel (Pre-paid smugglers with prior arrangement for 33kg consignments of gold). Ex-Royal Nepal Airlines used to serve Old Grouse in Shangrila Class. Now, moving with the times, there is blended Old Smuggler whiskey on the rocks, but offered only to card-carrying members and captains of industry from the All-Nepal Federation of Smugglers.      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Comes great news that NAC has been voted The World’s Most Popular Airline for introducing three classes: Economy Class, Chyangra Class and the new Premium Smuggler Class behind the cockpit. The airline’s widebodies are equipped with specially concealed cargo holds set aside for contraband to expedite customs clearance. Since smuggling has official legitimacy now, Nepal should now resist joining the World Trade Organisation. The greatest enemy of smuggling is global free trade, which is why the Ministry of Smuggling and Trafficking will accord due priority to this sector by announcing a one-window arrangement and incentive package that includes work visas and 5-year tax holidays for non-Nepali smugglers wanting to set up shop here. Only by opening up smuggling to international competition will Nepal survive in the global market. Otherwise we may be forever stuck taking oxes across the border.",/opinion,"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 02:38:53 +0000"
